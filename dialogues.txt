You taking up tennis? No, it's fly swatter.
I want to see it work.
Well, we need a fly.
I've been waiting whole morning.
Did you honestly just k*ll one? Hey, what's going on, guys? Ooh! Ah! Walk with dignity, you giant toddler.
Come on, Schmidt, you got to get this stuff out of here, man.
Yeah, well, I can't afford storage.
All my money's tied up in the storefront I leased for Jess' sister.
So why don't you put your junk in the storefront, Schmidt? You really want me to put an Ian Schrager rug in a room without climate control? What? Oh, he was the guy in Star Wars.
Medium talent.
Hey, guys.
Morning.
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
Come on, Coach! Let's hustle! I got Coach a job at the school, and it's his first day.
I don't like kids, I don't like teaching, I just like paychecks.
Well, I think you're gonna love it.
I don't think I'm gonna love it.
Run! Do not stop running or I will eat your faces and bodies! Keep running or I will m*rder your family! I love this job.
You're pissing me off! This one.
This one.
I got my eye on you.
Thanks for helping me move my stuff, you guys.
Lots of hairy boxes God, I've fallen.
Almost below you now, Nick.
Fellow passengers, stuck in the caboose of life.
You think I'm in the caboose of life? You love it in the caboose, not me.
It hurts.
It's actually quite jarring.
Loves it in the caboose - I don't love it in the caboose.
Yes, he does.
Uh, hi.
Are you guys open? Oh, this actually It's not a store.
Oh.
That's too bad.
I really like that lamp.
You like You like the lamp? I'm sorry.
You know what, it just It's just that It doesn't It doesn't feel like a store yet - is what I meant to say.
Piano player is a nice touch.
Aw, thank you very much.
He's lovely, isn't he? Pl-please look around.
Feel free.
The lamp is 100% full price.
Uh, pretty much everything's What you're doing is illegal.
You can't say this is a store.
I'm not taking advice from you.
You pronounce the "G" in "lasagna.
" Lasag-na.
Oh, my God.
I think my arm's broken.
I'm gonna sue the crap out of you.
Winston! Quiet.
So, I have Jamal Chambers in my fourth period, and he cannot stop talking about how fun and enthusiastic his new volleyball coach was.
You were right.
I love this job.
I knew it.
I knew you'd love it.
Hey.
I was looking for you.
You weren't in my car.
Internet's down.
Okay, um, well, I rebooted the router.
You're actually on the wrong IP address, so There you go.
Ooh.
You know I can see everything that you search for, right? I'm a biology teacher.
It's all research.
Fixing computers and stuff now? I'm just taking on a little extra responsibility around here, just getting stuff done that needs doing.
Graffiti's wrong, kids.
Don't do it.
I love corn on the cob, too, but I'm not gonna paint it all over the walls.
I'm just hoping, you know, in a few years I'll have enough experience that Dr.
Foster will consider me for vice principal.
Why don't you just ask him for it? You can't just ask for a promotion.
You know.
You have to earn the promotion with years of good work.
What's funny? Uh, how's that working out for you, Jess? Do you see this volleyball? It won't get over the net just because you want it to and you hope someone will notice that you want it to.
Okay.
I'm gonna ask you one more time: What do you want? Um, I want to be vice principal.
All right.
Then spike that ball, Jess.
Oh, that's not Okay, um - You got to spike! You got to spike! - Is that really Yeah.
Okay.
No, wait.
I'm not very good - Spike it! I've just never really been good with athlete b*lls.
Spike it! What do you want?! - I want to be vice principal.
Spike the ball and tell me what you want! I want to be the vice principal! - Yeah! - Yeah! Oh! Oh Oh! Oh I will not laugh.
An outrage! Been all over and I can't afford anybody.
Unbelievable.
Access to premium legal counsel should be every Jew's birthright.
And the jury will see that there is no justice for the Hebrew man.
Not in these so-called United States.
What is that that you're doing? I can't get enough of this legal drama.
Check this out.
Favorite author, Grisham.
Favorite TV show, Judging Amy.
Favorite color, courtroom brown.
Courtroom Brown.
Damn, I wish that was my nickname.
Did you just think of that? 'Cause it was perfect, man.
Courtroom Brown.
Dude, you're a born Courtroom Brown.
That's me.
When you say "Courtroom Brown," I respond.
Hey, Winston.
Hey, Courtroom Brown.
Yes? k*ll 'em, Courtroom! That's awesome! What am I supposed to do in this situation, represent myself like some nut job? Nick could be your lawyer.
This Nick? Vivica A.
Dropout? First of all, I don't want to be involved, but thank you, Courtroom Brown.
And second of all, I passed the bar, which means I can practice in the state of California.
Oh, Nick, you would be the worst in the whole entire world.
No offense.
I love you, dawg.
I could be your lawyer easy.
You don't forget how to be a lawyer.
It's like riding a bike.
They've changed these! Fine.
I forgot how to ride a bike.
But I'm not gonna forget how to be a lawyer.
I guess I have no choice.
You can be my lawyer, Nick.
I won't do it.
What? I value myself too great for that.
If you want me to be your lawyer, if you want to win this case, you must start with the word "please.
" And I'll need a symbolic five-dollar retainer.
Four dollars.
Skin it.
Let's do it.
Hooah.
Dr.
Foster, I am young, I'm energetic and I think it's about time you take advantage of me! Well, this is a little awkward.
I'm, uh I'm exclusively into Asian women.
It's really a Kristi Yamaguchi thing.
After Lillehammer - I really meant professionally.
I want you to take advantage of me like that.
Sorry.
It's a professional thing.
Okay.
Sorry.
I want to be vice principal.
Frank retired, you need someone.
I deserve it.
I bust my ass for this school.
You've got it.
The job is yours.
It is? - Oh, my God, are you kidding? I thought I was gonna have to force somebody into it.
This is so much easier.
Really? - Go ahead.
Be vice principal.
I can't believe this.
In fact, I think you should start right now.
You will not be sorry, sir.
Did you? - I got the job! Yeah! - Oh! - I spiked the ball.
Time to celebrate.
No! No! I'm not doing that! - No! - We got to celebrate! Celebrate! Let me pour it on your face and your clothes and your hair! Yeah.
Uh looks standard.
Yeah.
You're definitely being sued.
Uh, your deposition is tomorrow.
What-what do we do now? Do we prep for the plaintiff? I don't like prepping.
It makes me feel nervous.
I feel boxed in.
And I'm very quick - on my, uh - Sure.
Did you just forget the word "feet"? Feet.
Yeah.
Nick, you should really prep.
Fair enough.
Winston, you're my plaintiff.
Done deal.
Okay.
Hi, my name is Tim Baker.
I live at 522 Dugan Court Terrace.
Okay, Mr.
Baker, how long have you been a chef? I don't have to answer that.
You actually do though, Winston.
Doesn't he? You ask Why you asking me, man? - No, I'm not.
I'm Yeah.
You're the lawyer.
No, I know.
You have to answer.
How long you been a chef? I already answered that during background.
What in the hell? You did background without me? Why wasn't I invited for background? You have to answer it! How long you been a chef?! You're fired! Give me another chance.
No! Okay, here's something.
Get on a plane with me.
While you think about it, put this on my card.
It's the black one.
Wow.
That just happened.
You think maybe we should take his card and buy him a new shirt? I'm scared he'd want to change it in front of us.
I'm Cece.
Hi, Cece.
I'm Buster.
I really hope that's a nickname.
No, it's not a nickname.
It's your real name? I was bullied pretty bad.
Hi, Buster.
All right, hold on.
I've got quite an eye for young boys.
Oh, God.
That's right, I said it.
It's not a typo.
Let's see some I.
D.
God, you're handsome.
I'm sorry.
Wyoming! - Look at that.
Mm-hmm.
Wyoming.
So you're one - of the three people from Wyoming.
Yeah.
Cowboy state, big sky country, home of the Liberty Bell.
Bull snatch.
That's an awful accent.
What is your real accent? Are you Australian or from Heaven? How old are you, for real? - Leave him alone.
Don't bull-snatch a bull-snatcher.
Leave him alone.
You're over 21, right? I'm not.
Um I'm 20.
Get out of here, you delicious bastard.
Can I get my I.
D.
back? - No, of course not, you can't.
It'd be against the law, you wonderful creature.
Nice to meet you, Cece.
Good God, you look nice.
Nothing irks me like underage drinking.
It's stupid, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible.
God, I want to have sex with that kid so bad, it's freaking me out! Oh.
I'm real tingly.
We have talk about the budget.
There's a problem with the budget? But it's due Monday.
Yeah.
Do we have too much money? - No.
We need to f*re people.
What? - And when I say "we," I mean you.
Start with the most recent hires.
Well, we have, um Janet from the history department.
Human garbage.
Okay.
Ernie, uh Ah, yeah.
No.
That's Coach.
No.
No.
No.
No, he's very good at his job.
Last one in, first one out.
You know how this works.
That's just wrong.
This is the job, Ms.
Day.
He's my friend.
I can't.
No.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not f*ring Coach.
This is the job, Ms. Day.
Do you want it or not? I'm what? We had to do budget cuts, and we have to let two people go, and you're my friend, and I couldn't stop it.
I'm so sorry.
We all pitched in.
Thanks, guys, I'm not coach anymore.
I'm just Coach.
What? - What? Morning, Winston.
Are you not talking to me? Look, I had to f*re Coach for my job.
I didn't want to.
Don't squint at me.
Don't do that.
I did it for my job.
It wasn't my choice.
Hey, Nick, what's up, man? - What's up, Winnie? - Hey, Nick.
Hey.
Can we talk for a second? - Can I talk to you? Schmidt fired me, and now I'll never get to use this briefcase I just bought, and it was $19! - I think my thing is a little bit more - Do you think I'm sexier when I hold it or when it's down? 'Cause I think it's kind of sexier when I hold it, like this.
Not really.
Do I look like a man of power? Imagine this: It's, like, a rainy day, I'm on the streets of New York, Hey! Stop that cab! I'm a businessman.
I'm late to an important meeting.
I honestly feel like I would've been so good at this.
You don't want to be a lawyer.
Why do you care whether - Schmidt fired you or not? - I spent all those years at law school with those preppy dicks and I never got to prove them wrong, Jess.
Okay, go after what you want.
Just make sure that what you want doesn't make you a cog on the wheel - of a larger, flawed system.
Stop it.
Shut your mouth.
'Cause what you're saying is beautiful.
I'm gonna go put on my power suit.
High and loud, girl.
Whoo! Um Good talk, Nick.
With this thing, I feel so sexy, It's disgusting.
I think you misunderstood - Whoo! - Your representation running late? - Uh, no.
Actually, I'll be representing myself today.
Sorry we're late.
What? - This building is a total mess.
Nick Miller of, uh, Cooper, Bishop and Furguson.
As you know, my boss and senior partner, Mr.
Winston Furguson.
Gentlemen, pleased to be with you.
Please, please don't get up, don't get up.
I-I insist.
Madam Secretary.
What are you doing here? - I'm representing you.
Everything all right? - I'm a bit caught off guard.
I wasn't expecting these two very real lawyers to show up today.
Well, we wanted to let you know that the entire firm is standing behind you.
Besides, whether I sit in my office or in here it's all billable.
Am I right, gentlemen? Shall we get into this, or just take our pants off? Ask him a question.
Let me Let me do my thing.
Do your thing.
Mr.
Baker.
Yes? What's your home address? Okay.
Uh, no no further questions.
What? - Keep going.
Ow! Just keep going.
What are you Don't h*t me.
What are you hitting me for? - Is everything all right? - Sure it is.
The meter's running.
Even though you don't work at Coolidge anymore, you'll still be Coach Coach to those kids.
It's Coach Coach.
Yeah, Coach Coach.
Coach Coach.
Coach Coa - Coach Coach.
I'm sorry.
It's all good, Jess.
You did what you had to do.
I'm proud of you for that, okay? - Yeah.
I hope I'm the first of many you f*re.
That really means a lot to me.
I am gonna miss those kids, though.
Yeah.
That's what I'm gonna miss.
Those little those little bastards.
Little Ronnie.
Ronnie's so clumsy and slow.
Yeah.
Thomas.
I mean, he's strong, but that boy is a classic middle child.
He's just looking for love, up, back and sideways.
And Maurice.
He always makes a mess whenever he eats a Popsicle.
It's, like, dude, stop sucking your Popsicle like that, man.
You're never gonna get a girlfriend like that.
And then there's Hunter.
God Fat cross-eyed clod-hopping Hunter.
Hunter is the sweetest little idiot there ever was.
He's so sweet! He's so sweet! Ahh Screw this! Because you told me to go after what I wanted, and this is not what I wanted.
Let's go! We're gonna get you to that game! It's okay.
They're playing Pasadena.
They don't stand a chance.
Pasadena has a bunch of bitch-ass tricks.
Weren't raised right.
Hey, what do you want? I don't know.
I want to be there.
So, spike that ball! That was not a ball.
That was beer.
I know.
I feel really bad about it.
You know what? Don't feel bad! - Let's go! - Let's go! - You got me all fired up! I think you're gonna have to drive.
Mr.
Miller: "Were you or were you not wearing oversized shoes in the store?" Mr.
Baker: "I was not.
I told you that.
" Mr Miller: "But are you sure?" Mr.
Schmidt: "Shut up, Nick.
" Mr.
Miller: "Let me do this.
Ow.
Stop it.
" Mr.
Schmidt: "Stop what? You're hitting yourself.
" Mr.
Miller: "You're a child.
" Mr.
Schmidt: "A child would be a better lawyer.
" Mr.
Furguson: "Children are our future.
" Mr.
Berklan: "So true.
" Mr.
Miller: "I need to regroup.
I'm gonna stall a little bit.
Watch this.
Could the lady typer read that back?" All right, all right, we've had enough.
My client is graciously willing to settle for $20,000.
As an actual real attorney, I highly suggest you take the deal.
Great.
We'll do - Not a chance.
There's not a chance.
Sidebar.
Come on, Schmidt.
Hurry up.
Just You are not taking that settlement.
Well, Nick, at least if it's $20,000, I can get out of that hole some day.
I've got a plan.
You just have to give me a chance.
Can you believe in me? All right, I believe in you.
Deal.
Deal.
What's the plan? Oh, I'm not telling you.
You're gonna get too mad.
Let's go.
Nick, I take it back! I don't I don't believe in you! Here.
How long is this game? Go get 'em, Coach.
All right, listen up, you no-talent, idiot babies! Give me that.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Oh, thank God.
Bring it in.
Come on.
All right, now, who is gonna win this match?! Coolidge! Who's number one? Coolidge! Let me hear it! Who are we? - Coolidge! - Rakim! Really, Rakim? Like I just walked you right up to it, and you're gonna We're gonna talk.
Coolidge! - Too late, man.
It's too late.
All right, guys, get out there and make me proud! - Ms.
Day? - What? What is going on? I thought you fired Coach.
Look, Coach loves the kids, and the kids love him.
I want this job, but I'm not going to do it your way.
I'm not going to let our best people go.
You were the one who told me, we have no money.
Yeah, but we can make it up in other ways, we can be creative.
We can rent out the multipurpose room after school to local clubs.
And where will the orchestra practice? Did you ever consider that, Ms.
Day? Or were you too busy buying a ladies bike? - What? - They can use the library.
No one goes in there anyway.
Yeah, let's burn the books! Except for The Da Vinci Code.
Well, that took a weird turn, but Thank you, Susan.
That-that's so nice.
What a great solution.
Come on! Let's do it! Oh! Hunter, you animal! Yeah! h*t the robot.
Uh, uh, yeah, h*t it.
I guess we can figure out some way to keep him here.
God, you frost my cookies.
Thank you.
Way! Uh! Wait, what am I Get get back out there.
We got We still have a game to play.
Hey, Coach, guess what? - Ball! Oh.
Oh.
It's okay.
Don't laugh, guys.
Did you see that h*t her face? - I'm okay.
I'm gonna sit down.
So, are you gonna sit, or? No, I'm gonna stand.
'Cause isn't that what we are doing? Standing for the little guy? What is the plan? Injustice! I will not stand for it.
That is why I will sit right now.
I will sit down in this chair You're negligent! Aah! Get off me! My neck! My neck! Seriously? The fall-down on the chair bit? - Is this your first case? - Yes, it is.
And that is why I'll file petition on petition.
You're gonna wake up in the morning to paperwork.
You're gonna go to bed at night to paperwork.
So how about this, gentlemen? You pay the $20,000 settlement to your client yourself, and you'll never see our faces again.
What do you call a lunatic who's only got one case and no hobbies? Your worst nightmare.
Let's go, guys.
Listen, Bill, if you ever want to play with the big boys, you'll give me a ring, won't you? This is a baseball card.
Yeah.
All right! - All right.
You did it.
I did it.
Salud.
Cheers! - Oh! - Oh! Another round of sh*ts.
On the house! - You don't get to say that, Winnie.
You know that, right? Okay.
Oh, I knew you'd come back for me.
So what do you want to do now? You want to just drive? Oh, no.
Mike! - What? - Ple I got it.
Thank you.
Hey, what you doing here? - I just wanted to come and say - Mm-hmm.
First things first.
The legal drinking age in Australia is 18.
Second, you're really beautiful.
Like, you're really beautiful.
Like, I want to take you out some time.
But because I'm 20 and already at a bit of a disadvantage, I thought I'd come and do some uncharacteristic self-promotion to help the cause? - Okay.
And let you know that well, I just opened my own business.
I build boats.
Uh, wooden boats with my hands.
Mm-hmm.
Um, old ladies love me.
They call me sensitive.
And I'm a really good cook.
But I know three dishes, and two of those dishes are the same thing.
Yeah, that's about it, so, what do you think? Do you want to get a drink? Like a soft drink with you? - Soft drink, a walk.
Can you have a coffee? - Yeah, I love coffee.
Mm-hmm.
It's one of the three meals that I know how I make.
All right.
Oh, do it! - Well, done, sir! - Oh! - Oh, yeah.
Or you know what? We could actually we could probably just go now.
I'd like to comb your hair, you hunk.
I don't know who they are.
They just come in here, and they drink, and make a lot of noise and talk about things they don't know about! Hey, Mike, I'm gonna take a break.
Um I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll just meet you out front.
Stop what you're doing.
There's a lawyer here to make Jessica? Jessica, I won the case.
If you woke up right now, we could be making love.
Jessica? Power couple.
Thank you so much for having us over for brunch, guys.
It's the least that we could do to celebrate the one-week anniversary of your sister moving in with me and becoming my live-in lover.
Was a little fast.
Babe, you have syrup on your face.
Oh, you can get it.
Mmm.
Babe, you have some powdered sugar (muffled): Back off! I'm starving! Come on.
Just let me get it off.
It's so much.
Get your own French toast, Jess! I got these slices, so they're for me to eat.
If you want the slices, get your own slices.
Coach: Um, that's your fourth plate, Winston.
I'm trying to bulk up for the LAPD fitness exam.
I am going to ace this obstacle course.
Schmidt, you got something crazy around your neck.
Abby made this.
Look.
Ow.
Look at that.
Not a fan.
I forgot how much I love making jewelry.
Schmidt's been lending me money for supplies.
Yeah.
Schmidt, are you bleeding? Oh, look at that.
I most certainly am.
Wow.
What makes Abby's jewelry so interesting is that it's actually dangerous and can cut you.
Abby's gonna open up her own store one day.
Mark my words.
She shouldn't do that.
Nope.
I'm gonna open up a store in your mouth.
But now that you're living here, I can have my old room back.
Jess, I'm gonna need you gone by 5:00.
Done.
I need a break from Snore-a Ephron over here.
Okay.
Oh, Schmidt and I don't need any space.
We have no boundaries.
But I guess not everybody can have what Schmidt and I have.
You guys will probably get there.
Don't worry.
Remember how long it took you to get boobs? Yeah, but I started shaving my legs at nine.
So joke's on you.
Mmm.
Wait.
We have so much sex.
Don't try to eat the other slice.
I'm gonna get to it.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
Can you believe Abby and Schmidt? Yeah, tell me about it.
Making love at their own brunch? No class.
They're a fake couple.
They're not real.
We're a real couple.
If anyone should be moving in together, it's us.
Well, you know, we already live in the same apartment.
Right.
So why not take the extra step? We basically sleep in each other's rooms every night, so what is the difference? It's a really big difference.
Because right now we're roommates but we're not living together.
Not "living together.
" - You know? - No.
Living together is a step.
It's official.
It's an official step in a relationship.
So the word "official" is the key.
Abby and Schmidt did it after one week.
Come on.
We have so much left to learn about each other, stuff you can only learn if you're crammed together in a small space and you can't get out.
Just you and me.
Four walls.
No boundaries, no escape.
When you put it like that, it sounds amazing.
And like prison.
Well, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room.
It's so close.
Just pop over there.
Mm.
Do you not want to? - Whoa.
(whistles) I did not - That did not - So you're saying you do want to? (chuckles) Oh, my God, Nick, we're moving in together! - Officially? We just agreed on it? - Yes! Yes! I cannot think of a reason why not to.
Reason 13: I like my stuff and I hate her stuff.
Reason number 14: How am I ever gonna change my clothes? You don't change in front of your girlfriend? You get naked in front of her.
Yes, but those are different things.
When you're naked, you're powerful and it's glorious.
When you're changing, you're hunched over and cowering, like an animal.
Animals don't wear clothes, Nick.
All I'm saying is I need my space.
True intimacy.
Embrace that.
Abby and I, we have one sponge.
And we use it for everything.
I don't like that, but you seem happy.
Don't hold back, Nick.
Expose your cracks and love will fill them.
That's nice.
Thank you.
Do you know how hard it's been for me to take this conversation seriously while you're wearing - that thing around your neck? - It's an Iroquois throat band.
That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
Yeah, you're jealous.
No, I'm not.
It's not just a choker, it's story.
What's the story? She didn't have enough supplies? - I'm not through the whole thing yet.
I got to tell you, man, looking at that thing, the sex must be awesome.
Coach: Cece and I have been hanging out a lot more lately.
She sort of treats me like I'm one of her girl friends, and (strained): You don't like it? I love it.
I mean, usually, when I'm friends with a girl, I'm either trying to get that butt or she's trying to get this butt.
But with Cece, it's not about the butt.
(chuckles) It's not about the butt, man.
It's cool.
It's like We're like sisters.
What? Coach.
Hey, do you have, uh, Schmidt's keys? Kind of got a weird favor to ask.
It's only weird if you don't ask, girl.
(laughs) - What? - That's what I'm talking about.
(meows) (grunts) You know I'm doing this for you, right? - Somewhere - This is great.
(chuckles) What are we doing? We are snooping on Abby.
Oh, love it.
I do not trust that girl.
She's always working an angle.
Now she's got Schmidt all wrapped up, giving her money for "jewelry.
" Treachery! (Coach screams) First, they came for my silverware and I said nothing.
What's up, dawg? - What are you guys doing here? Schmidt, I know that Abby is fun and she is charming, but I'm telling you, she's bad news.
Is that why you guys are sorting through my garbage? I appreciate the concern, you guys, but Abby has changed.
Coach: Then how do you explain this? I put my coffee grounds in a plastic bag so it doesn't get the rest of my trash dirty.
Really? - Yeah, he does that.
You got clean-ass trash, man.
I don't even need gloves for this.
Quit sorting through my trash, Coach.
You're messing it all up.
Schmidt, you've known this girl for a couple weeks, okay? I've known her for 20 years, and, I am telling you, she's not to be trusted.
Your words are changing his opinions about things.
(chuckles) Up top.
Mm.
You two as friends is a real bummer.
I'm not into it.
Jess: Our first night living together.
I'm just excited.
Expose your cracks and love will fill them.
I'm changing.
Great.
I'm reading.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm just gonna take my pants off.
Okay.
(grumbling) You know, I've seen you naked before, right? What's going on there? Oh! Never changed in front of a woman.
You know, mostly you just hook up and - Really? Are you serious? All right, I'm gonna read.
(clears throat) Okay.
Here we go.
(Nick moans) Yeah, it's Just gonna put this on here.
What is that? Oh, this is my long shirt.
(snorts) - Yeah.
Oh.
That's why you're laughing.
I had it on the wrong way.
(laughs) That must have been funny-looking the way it was.
I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.
And so yeah.
Why does your bottom need to breathe? Well, it's like a plant.
Needs sun and air to survive.
Never mind.
Um I like it.
Um yeah.
Great.
I like it.
(grunts) Okay.
This is great.
This is great.
I'm excited.
Me, too.
What are you doing to the pillow? - I'm trying to get comfortable.
Oh, okay.
Got it.

Mm.
Ow! What? So-Sorry.

Okay.
Yeah, that's That's gonna be better for me.
You know what, I'm gonna get some water.
(muffled music playing) - Oh, hey.
My room looks totally different.
Turned it into a workout space.
I am so glad it opened up.
Oh, why didn't we do this sooner? Crab walk.
You don't know where a crab's gonna go.
And you know what? Where does the crab go? Oh! Oh, aah! Owie.
(elevator bell dings) Hi.
Just enjoying the peace and quiet.
Whoa, hold up.
Hey, Jess, what are you doing? Oh, I just, you know, sometimes I work in the elevator now.
(whispers): You know, helping some of the older residents.
Hmm? (elevator bell dings) (loudly): This is your floor, ma'am.
So, how are things going with you and Schmidt living together? I have never felt so clean while being so dirty.
Awesome.
Last night, Schmidt wanted to take me to a hotel, but we could not even get out of the loft without ripping each other's clothes off.
Oh, that's our thing, too.
We have the hotel until tomorrow night and it's all paid up.
You guys might as well use it.
Take it off our hands.
(elevator bell dings) Lobby, please.
(mouths words) Wait, I forgot Bernie.
Hold the elevator.
Bernie, Bernie, where are you, you idiot? I'll just be here, waiting.
Winston: So, Nick, the police academy training is going well, but I'm a little worried about the rings, because of the you know the incident.
(laughter) Shut up, you guys, I can do this.
No, Miller, no, Miller, no! (laughter) (laughs) I'm sor I got big laughs.
You got to give the people what they want.
Everybody saw my ding-a-ling, Nick.
My ding-a-ling.
I've got an issue that's more important than this.
Ever since Jess moved in, I haven't had a second to myself.
You see what she's done to my writer's desk? It's like an arts and crafts area now, man.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
I'm staying at a hotel tonight.
Not alone.
With other people.
I have to chaperone a field trip to Sacramento, so You know what, you seem too busy to talk about it.
Go, go.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you.
Wait, weren't you just saying how you Whoa, dude! (Jess laughs) - Good one, Nick.
Bye.
Bye, yeah.
That, uh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
Schmidt: I can't believe I let you guys talk me into tailing my own girlfriend.
Cece: Look at this neighborhood, Schmidt, she is up to no good.
I feel very uncomfortable being here, I trust Abby, I don't want to spy on her any more, okay? We're not spying.
We're just carefully watching.
Girlfriend is going down.
Yeah, she is.
Let us bust her, buster.
(giggles) That was a good one.
That was.
Yeah.
Okay.
(both sigh) This dynamic between the two of you It's very annoying to me.
I'm sure I'm not alone on this.
Hi, hater.
Bye, hater.
Okay, enough is enough.
I'm getting out of here.
Hey, it's my car - Guys, guys.
I don't care whose car it is, I'm going.
I don't care who - It's my car.
Oh.
Aah! (gasps) Great.
h*t a parked car in the same neighborhood they sh*t friggin' Children of Men.
Yeah! I'm alone! (laughs) Yeah.
I made my reservation I'm leaving town tomorrow (yells happily) I'll find somebody new (grunts, laughs) I'm alone and I love it.
Coffee for one, a sundae for one, and the most tasteful, story-driven (whispers) adult film.
Preferably a period piece.
The farther in the past, the better.
You know what I'm talking about, girl.
(sobs) Do you have anything in the Byzantine Era? No? All right, just a sh*t in the dark.
Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley (sobbing): It's so little.
It's so little.
Bump, bump, bump went my heartstrings When he smiled, I could feel the car shake (pounding on wall): I'm trying to sleep! - Okay! - Which ding is ours? - Which ding is ours? Coach, there are Kn*fe holes in the door.
What does it matter? Let's get out of here.
At least write "sorry" and put it under the windshield wiper There are none.
Uh Maybe put it under the d*ad bird's leg? - Hobo! - Aah, there's a dude! (screaming) Ho-ho-hobo, for real! - Hobo! - Son of a bitch Hobo.
Thank you, Jingles.
You got it, girl.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here? Tailing me? - No.
Um - Yes, we're tailing you.
I know how you work: You glom onto guys and then you just bleed them dry.
Well, you are not gonna do it to Schmidt.
What's in the box? Tell us what's in the box.
Zippers.
What? (laughs) Z Zippers, you guys.
Guy up there'll give you a great deal.
He also loves cr*ck.
Can we go now? Thank you, Abby, let's go.
My car is gone.
Well, that's not surprising.
Oh, you can do this.
You can do this, Winnie.
What are you doing here? On a school day? I see this means you're the cutting type.
Which means you're the pantsing type.
Well, I got news for you, buddy.
You ain't getting 'em! Not today.
How 'bout I take your pants, huh? Not like that, everybody! I'm not trying to take the little kid's pants.
He's trying to take my pants.
You see how he's eyeing my pants? So I eyed his pants You know what? You win.
You win, you little son of a bitch.
You win! I don't want to tell you how to police your beach, but right now there are truants outside of this hotel, stirring up trouble.
Hey, yo, lookin' good, Charlie! Debbie, see you at 1:00 on the massage table.
Winston.
Mm.
We are gonna sneak into Schmidt's and see what's really inside those boxes.
Cece, darling - Hmm? - What? - How long have we been friends? A week or so? - And have I ever steered you wrong? - Well, no Exactly.
Because I know you better than anyone, girl.
And you're acting like a lunatic.
I mean, the kind of lunatic other lunatics look at and go, "Oh, my God, that bitch a lunatic.
" So I'm gonna need you to figure out why you're really doing all this for Schmidt and then sort it out.
You did not just say that to me.
Think about it, girl.
sh**t Just to be clear, I did not ask you to act like this, okay? - It's just kind of fun to do - Slow down, girl.
You gonna eat that scone? - Damn it.
Slow down.
Are you-are you gonna have this scone? - Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Just looking at my Garbage Pail Kids.
Jess makes me put 'em in a box.
How are you gonna put art like this in a box? What's going on with you? Nothing You will not tell Nick that you saw me here because then he'll get upset and I'm gonna have to move into my old room, and that means that we suck as a couple and that Abby was right and I cannot let that happen.
Jess went to a hotel because sharing a room with you is driving her crazy.
(relieved moaning) Dude, at really was a tough one to keep in, but, honestly, I held my own and I did - my best.
Are you kidding me?! I can't believe it! I changed in front of her! Sharing a room is driving you crazy, too.
But I didn't lie about it.
I never get to win these things.
So, anyway, I just want to apologize.
It was wrong of me to get involved.
Are you sure you don't want to tap Abby's phone? Run a DNA sample? I don't want to be coarse, but the bedroom is covered in it.
I was worried about you, okay? I didn't want her to take advantage of you 'cause I know that you will do anything for the people that you care about.
Well, I guess I could say the same thing about you.
And, you know what, maybe Abby has changed.
I'm thinking about helping Abby lease a storefront - for her jewelry.
Is that crazy? - It's - (chuckles) It's amazing.
Don't hold back.
Here.
Here, I want you to have this.
Oh.
Abby made it.
Oh Mm It's a cough drop and - these are hard candies.
I see that.
I truly hate it.
You're welcome.
(sighs) - Oh.
Oh, hey.
How was Sacramento? It was great.
The kids cried when they saw the capital.
Oh, did they? How many students showed up? - What hotel did you stay at? - Old Sacramento Inn.
What room did you stay in? - 523.
What floor was that on? - Five.
Was there an elevator to the 4th floor? - 5th floor.
Smoking or non-smoking? - Smoking.
You don't smoke.
In Sacramento, I do.
What'd you have for breakfast? - Continental.
How are you this good at lying?! I know you're making this all up! I know you didn't go to Sacramento.
I know you went to a hotel to be by yourself.
Damn it, Winston! - Nick loved being alone, too! - Damn it, Winston! - That's for my ding-a-ling! You didn't like living together either? No, but it was your idea, and it seemed like the thing to do.
But at least I didn't lie about it, Jess.
Okay, I did! But you were driving me crazy.
(quietly): You wear a nightgown.
Are you talking about my long shirt? You look like the Little Match Girl, wandering around Victorian England selling matches for a penny.
I look like George Washington.
I was just trying to be a good couple.
Schmidt and Abby are doing it.
Well, Schmidt and Abby are crazy.
They're doing a lot of things.
Why can't we do this? I don't know.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh-oh.
Last time I saw you day-drinking was when you got kicked out of jazz ensemble.
I'm still pissed off about that.
What does that mean, "too enthusiastic"? How come you're not at the hotel? Did you and Nick break the bed? Because, legally, they cannot make you pay for that.
No.
I was by myself.
Oh, I've broken the bed by myself.
Big-time.
No, I went to the hotel to get away from Nick.
And I wore a robe and I watched a documentary about Ethel Kennedy and it was one of the best nights of my life.
So you win.
Your relationship's better than mine.
And I can't even share a room with Nick.
I don't win.
Come on.
I swing from guy to guy.
I don't think I have ever paid my own rent.
You travel the world, collecting lovers.
All my lovers could fit in one SUV.
And, yes, maybe somebody would have to sit on someone's lap, but they would fit.
And you're just brave.
You and Nick are brave.
You guys know each other, you get under each other's skin.
He has the feet of a hippy cult leader.
But that's the difference.
I just throw myself into whatever comes along because I really don't want to be alone.
Why not? Being alone's great.
You should try it sometime.
Seriously.
It might help you figure yourself out.
(sighs) You're Abby Freaking Day.
You can do whatever you want.
Except vote.
(laughs) But, seriously, you should've seen Nick's feet.
The bottoms are all black, except for one patch of yellow.
(laughs) - Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing? - Oh, just packing up your things and then I thought about what you would want and how you probably didn't want to move again, so I decided to do the right thing and just take your room.
My room's bigger.
Is it? I never - Nice try.
All right.
I got to move some stuff back then.
(chuckles) - Hey.
I'm sorry that this didn't work out.
I'm sorry that we sucked.
Look, we don't suck.
I'm crazy about you, but I don't have to spend every second with you in what amounts to a one-room log cabin.
Cabins are what drove the Pilgrims crazy.
That's why they k*lled each other at the Plymouth Rock m*ssacre.
That's not a real thing.
So how did the millions of Pilgrims die? There definitely weren't millions of Pilgrims.
Then how do you explain my 37-page essay about it? - I think you made it up in your head.
This seems like one of those - "agree to disagree" moments - No.
It's not.
I'm also older than you.
Anyway, I love you and someday we'll make this work.
I think so, too.
Just-just not now.
Not like this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But if you're not doing anything, want to come over? I am over.
(knocking) - Oh! - Hey, guys.
Uh, just a little hot goss from apartment 4C.
Abby's gone.
What? - She's gonna stay with your mom for a little bit.
Something about saving up to be independent? Wow.
Good for her.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
You know in hindsight, maybe we moved a little bit too fast.
I just wish that I had realized that - before I rented her a storefront.
You rented her a storefront? It was a three-year lease in an undesirable neighborhood.
(chuckles) It totally obliterated my bank account, so I've decided to sublet my place, and I'll be moving back here, under duress.
Y-You're moving back in here? Well, it shouldn't be a problem, right? I mean, Coach is in my room, and you guys are now moving in together.
I'll just move into Jess' room.
Cool? - Yeah, but, like - Asking was just kind of a formality.
'Cause my name's on the lease, so You guys are the best.
Oh (sighs) (chuckles) - Yay! - Yay.
Cool.
Great.
Let's do this.
We can make it work.
You have to start washing your feet.
Man, this is gonna be fun! - Ah, come on! Get it close to the light.
Okay, just because you invented Sky Kn*fe doesn't mean you can tell me how to throw.
Hurry up, man.
You can do this.
One, two, three.
All: Sky Kn*fe! (cheering) Yeah! What's up? Oh, hey.
What's up? Nothing, just a Hey, uh, straight-up chillin'.
(indistinct chatter) Jess: You guys, it's a really long story, but I think I saw an eagle.
I was shopping for books on Western Oh, my God! (all exclaim) - Oh! - Oh! Oh, God, what the hell? You were in the drop zone.
Good save, Nick.
You were a hero! Good save.
We were playing Sky Kn*fe.
You mad? No.
No.
I I think it's been a great game this week.
I'm amazed at how great it is.
Uh! Awesome! I thought you were gonna be mad.
All right.
I'm gonna go get the bad-ass knives from Schmidt's house.
Cool.
Get 'em, girl.
Um, guys, we have a problem.
I know, but Abby's gonna fix it.
She's going to get the cooler knives.
The problem is Abby.
She's been here one week and has already created chaos everywhere.
I don't know if anybody noticed, but she destroyed my sunflower painting - with a picture of a penis.
The iguana's cool.
I like the iguana.
Who doesn't love an iguana? - I like its tail.
Yeah.
Oh, my God, you guys, it's Terry.
The bastard found me.
He wants his stuff.
Who's Terry?! What's his stuff?! Cocaine drugs?! Worse.
You guys got to hide.
Oh, my God, I knew this was gonna happen.
Everybody in your earthquake spots now! - Jess! (laughter) She's messing with you.
(laughter) Yeah, I know.
We are messing with you.
No.
I don't think you were involved.
Don't taunt you, dude.
You guys were all afraid of Terry.
Us Day sisters up to our old pranks.
You're not part of it.
(in high-pitched voice): Yes, I am! - You got messed with.
You got messed with, not me.
You're doing that voice when you get messed with.
No, I'm not.
You guys, this is so fun.
I want to live here.
(fake laughing): Ah, ha, ha! That was funny, 'cause we're messing with you again.
No.
I'm serious.
That one was real.
I think I should live here.
I hate this game.
(all exclaiming) Hey, girl What you doing? Hey, girl Where you going? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
You looking up how to eat a bagel? - (laughs) No.
I'm, uh, seeing if I passed the LAPD entrance exam.
Results go up in 30 seconds.
If you pass, you get to be a cop? No, I get to go to the police academy, you know? Hope I get a dog partner.
Yeah.
Oh, you are pretty calm for someone who's about to get life-changing news.
You must be really cool under pressure.
No! I'm a huge choker.
Huge! (laughs) Girl, I ain't had a job in over three months.
So, this is that moment, I guess, when you find out if you're really a failure or not.
Check it.
Excitement's k*lling me! Man, would you look at the time? Man.
Girl, I got an obligation at a sandwich meeting to to go to.
Yes Nick (in dramatic voice): Well, you see, loyalty has a price, Mr.
President.
Give me the hot dogs! Put the damn hot dogs in the bag, you son of a bitch, and I won't Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do? She can't move in to Take that off.
I hope those are clean.
Enough.
I don't want to be involved with your weird thing with your sister.
It's not a weird thing with my sister.
She is crazy.
No.
She's wanted in Canada.
Canada.
No one's wanted in Canada.
Hey, uh, you guys want to hang out, like, right now? Maybe go up to Alhambra, try on a whole mess of jeans? Don't you find out about that cop test today? Oh, you know Oh, yeah.
No.
Look, man, the Alhambra thing, though it's getting a lot of momentum, you know? So I think I'm gonna go ahead and do that 'cause when you you know, when you do that, so Okay, I'm gonna guarantee you that Abby is responsible for that.
Winston: Yeah, she got to me.
If you don't want Abby to live here, Jessica, why don't you just tell her? Nick, you can't just tell Abby to do something, 'cause she'll do the opposite.
So I'm gonna have to go find a place for her to live and make her think it's her idea.
She can't find out what I'm up to.
Do you think you can keep her busy and lie to her all day? Jess, I come from a family of con artists and liars.
And the one thing I learned is, you can't lie to a liar.
It don't fly.
Yeah, you shouldn't be involved.
No, I shouldn't.
Wait a second.
Are you doing reverse psychology? Yeah, it is reverse psychology.
That is reverse psychology, so you just reversed it, so now it's reverse, reverse, which is just psychology.
Hmm, which one is it? You outfoxed me.
I'm in.
I'm gonna do it.
So, our time is up, but, um, I don't have any more clients, so, uh Oh.
You brought it with that less set, ma.
I got to tell you.
I mean, what can't that butt do? - You shaped it, so you get dibs.
Mmm.
Dibs.
(laughter) Can I get dibs? Because both y'all butts look great.
I mean, I can't tell who's in first place.
Hey, uh, Coach, you know how you're always getting on me about my pizza baby? - Yeah.
Well, today is the day that I get rid of it.
I am here to train.
Save it, dude.
You're avoiding your test results.
Nick texted me.
Guess you can't outrun a text.
Nope.
Well, with the right amount of training All right, listen to me.
Um, I need you to leave.
I'm with a client.
A beautiful one.
I'm trying to, you know - Mm.
(whistles) You're trying to whistle.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm trying to have sex with her.
Oh! Sex.
But I did book you for the entire afternoon, though.
(groans) - Why would you do that? - But if you guys are doing a little thing, then I could easily just - Leave and check your test scores? - do a tandem session.
Oh, fun.
Right? Coach, you should show him that ground stretch you did on me earlier.
It was opening me up really nicely.
Yes, please.
(laughs) I don't wanna.
(grunts) Oh.
(sighs) (Winston grunts) This is amazing.
Oh! I'm taking a little trip here, Coach.
You know where I'm going.
Why do I keep looking down? I don't know.
This museum is my favorite place in Los Angeles.
Um come on, Nick.
Jess is making you babysit me, right? Babysit you? (laughing): What? Like you're a little baby? No.
That's how you want to play this? - Well, I'm not "playing" it.
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing? - I just want to touch it.
Don't touch it.
I just need to touch it.
But it's not for touching.
(inhales) - Hey, hey! What? Can I not jump on it? - Abby.
That's not allowed? - Abby! - Maybe I shouldn't climb all over the car.
You need to get off of that car.
Why don't you tell me what it is Jess is up to? Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you're scratching the hood! Tell me what I want to know.
Get off there right now.
There's nothing to tell! - Tell me what I want to know.
There's nothing to tell! - Tell me what she's doing! - Get her off! - If I tell you, will you get off the car? - Yes.
You promise? - Yes.
She's looking for a safe apartment for you 'cause she doesn't want you to live with us! Now, would you please get off the car? Do you guys serve drinks here? (sighs) Why don't they give us Tasers? Wow.
I mean, this place is beautiful.
It makes the other nine places we've seen today just kind of fade away.
Yeah, um, tell me about the neighborhood.
Is there a lot of nightlife? Well, this part of town is pretty quiet.
Unless you count church bells.
Which you should.
We have nine within hearing distance.
What about the other tenants? Are there single men between 18 and 65? Actually, make that 16 and 72.
Most of the other tenants are middle-aged gay veterans like myself.
Oh.
Whoa.
Jackpot.
And if the demons come calling, there's an emergency room right across the street.
You had me at "gay veterans.
" And then again at "emergency room.
" And before that at "church.
" I wish I could just travel back in time and tell 19-year-old me to move into a place like this.
Maybe I would've settled down.
Met a, you know, nice guy.
Nothing flashy.
Works in a bank, makes a great veggie lasagna.
Okay, not now, Cece.
No, don't stop her.
Who is this guy? (laughs) Right? (sighs) Bet you are a mean dancer.
Come on.
Live a little.
You were right to call me.
Nobody deals with crazy girls better than I do.
Crazy girls are kind of my Hurt Locker.
You know what I mean, Nick? - Okay.
Yeah.
Some-some men, they can just walk away.
Not me.
I just keep coming back.
Okay, are you gonna help me - get her off the car? - Mmm.
You know what this is, Nick? - What? - This is nonsense.
Exactly.
And how do we deal with nonsense? No, no.
We just don't stand for it is what we do.
Security is on the way.
Come on, you old bird.
Get up here.
I can't afford it.
I'm already the staff troublemaker.
Can you make it happen? - I'm thinking.
Where are you at right Like, is it kind of game Yeah.
Just shh.
I got it.
You do? Yeah.
No nonsense.
Hey, Abby, look at me.
Let's go get a taco.
Okay.
You got to be kidding.
There you go.
Thank you.
There you go.
Perfect.
Hey, you're not gonna tell Jess I told you about the apartment, right? Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe.
We'll see.
It'd be cool if you 'Cause Why don't you straighten things up with the museum? Thank you.
I appreciate that.
It's only ten dollars! That's not gonna It's ten dollars! You snakes.
Coach: Follow through.
Yeah, all right.
Or else that creepy guy at the bar isn't gonna take his hand off your thigh.
Hands off my thigh, dude! (grunts, groans) Hands off my thigh, dude.
(groans) What are you doing, dude? Stop stalling.
Check your score.
I'm not stalling.
(groans) I'm gonna have Anders work my core and maybe just go get some juice with him.

No, I-I want juice.
I'm - Hey, I bought your time.
I do whatever I want with it.

Wait, what are you doing, dude?! - I'm checking it myself! No! Come on, man! I said no, dude.
No.
W What? You failed.
(chuckles) I didn't even You know, it's not even a Yeah, it's not a big deal, so You know, so You should probably put a passcode on your phone, dude.
Hey, Schmidt! Hey, Schmidt.
Have you seen Abby? Huh? (sultry piano music playing) What are you what are you doing? I'm melting chocolate.
Abby and I are having sex.
(whispers): What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt? I've really changed my tune on nonsense, Nick.
You know, for the life of me, I could not understand the grasp that Jess had on you, but if she came from the same gene pool as this one (chuckles) kudos, my friend.
Even if it's a tenth of what I just experienced.
Even if it'sa DeVito/Schwarzenegger split from Twins.
You calling Jess the DeVito? - What? - Abby, I was supposed to be watching you.
Go ahead.
Don't don't play tricks with my words.
Jess is gonna k*ll me.
She's gonna say my name in that short, clipped way - where she doesn't add the "K.
" - What? When she's mad, she just says "Nic.
" Do you really think that the "K" adds to the sound of your name? - Yes.
How do you usually say your name? - Nick.
Say it without the "K.
" - Nic.
It's the same thing.
Stop distracting me! Nick, you're so worried about disappointing Jess.
Relax, man.
(ding) Okay, you got to get out of here.
(grunts) (moans) (grunts) (giggles) Oh I choked.
I choked, man.
I'm 31.
I have nothing figured out.
Can I not find a job? - I mean, I feel like I'm losing it.
Dude, they're hiring here.
You know I can't work here, man.
They never have any cookies.
It's all the better, man! There's no pressure.
You get this job and then when you're ready, you try the cop thing again.
Okay.
See? - Yeah.
But now I'm sitting here thinking about how badly I need this job.
Stop! - I need this job real bad Excuse me, um, could we get a job application over here, please? In a way, I have a lot more riding on this job than I do the cop thing.
God, I'd love to work here! Jess: I got the apartment! The place is great.
The only thing I'm a little worried about is there is a Russian grocery store down the block and Abby has a little bit of a weird thing with ethnic white people.
But I think she could really thrive there! Where is she? - Where's who? - Abby.
Ab? Oh, she's sleeping.
By herself.
Which is called "napping.
" Okay, I'm gonna start secretly packing up some of her stuff.
Do you think you can keep distracting her? - Yes, yeah, you know, just - Good.
how do we distract her? How do you distract a woman like that? Probably a guy.
(laughs): Right? Who can we set her up with? Well, well, well, who do we have? Coach.
(laughs) No.
Winston That's actually kind of a good idea No! - Schmidt! - That's a terrible idea.
But in the same sense Abby will wreck Schmidt! - Well, then luckily, the - So, here's the plan.
We're gonna have a nice dinner, we're gonna get her buzzed but not drunk.
And then we're gonna casually and naturally bring up the apartment so she thinks it's her idea.
And I can do that, okay? - Okay, good.
I'm glad.
I'll act cool, natural.
Casual.
Au naturel.
Au casual.
You know what? Maybe I should write you some lines, pal.
Yeah, I'd really appreciate that 'cause Maybe not a lot of words.
Uh, so tell me, what are your three weakest qualities? (chuckles) See (whispering): Just say "perfectionist.
" - Perfectionist.
Yeah.
And the other two um (laughs) (sputtering) I'm overheating, right? I'm overheating, okay? So here's what we're gonna do now I'm just gonna sh**t from the hip, little rapid f*re, give you some fun facts you might not know about me.
I hate standing up, I'm bad with numbers, and I just honestly, from the bottom of my heart, don't think women should be allowed to handle money.
Just, that's for real.
Let's just move on to the salary.
And you didn't even fill out the back of the application.
There's a back? There is a back to the application? - Coach.
What? The LAPD exam maybe it had a back.
You didn't check to see if it had a back? We got to go to the precinct.
I didn't choke.
I'm just careless.
And that is my biggest weakness, you bitch.
I'm so sorry, dude.
I'm so sorry, dude.
Yeah, that was bad.
Man, I didn't even mean that.
All right, get out of here.
Get out of here.
Dawg, I didn't mean that at all, man.
To our newest resident.
The City of Angels has sprouted another pair of wings.
It's a majestic city, drenched in sunshine, that is actually just a collection of 75 different neighborhoods.
Wow, I had no idea.
Please continue to tell me more.
You want more? - Who wants to rediscover couscous? Hey, what the hell are you doing here, Schmidt? I invited him.
I live here, too, right? - Yeah, but It's okay, Abby can make her own decisions, no matter what they might lead to.
Thank you.
Now, somebody call the pound 'cause my stomach is growling.
I said my stomach is growling.
Sp okay, uh, speaking of dinner, there are a lot of great options in North Hollywood.
It's a real hot spot full of young, hip people who will be the leaders of tomorrow.
More wine? - Great.
If I were moving to L.
A.
now, I'd say yes-ho to NoHo.
Nick: Hey, hey, what are you doing? Oh, my.
Stop touching him, Abby.
I'm sorry, what'd you say? - Touch him more? - Do not touch him.
What are you? Do not do this right now.
(whispering): How about that? As luck would have it, I actually know of a place in North Hollywood with great tile work.
(pouring wine) I said, "Great tile work.
" Oh, for the first 12 months.
(Jess laughs) I think what you really mean to say is there's an introductory offer - for cable television.
That's it, yeah Cable's a scam, I tell ya.
Sa Satellite.
What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt? Satellite's where it's at.
(whispering): Nonsense has the hands of an angel.
Okay, what's going on here? (chuckles) I told Abby about the apartment, and now she's giving Schmidt a sp a special.
Don't look at me.
Just look away.
Look away, look or look right at me.
So this was going on the whole time? - Yes.
And the hands are just the half of it.
I mean, there's been banging and poking and scratching and hanging and teasing such teasing.
I mean, really excruciating, life-giving teasing.
Shut up, Schmidt! She was talking to me.
This has been a whole day of lying and I can't take it.
First I had to lie to Abby, and so I spilled the beans - about the apartment.
I'm sorry.
And then I had to lie about Abby and Schmidt and the boning.
And then the manipulating and the out-manipulating That's lying! If you guys were just honest with each other for one second, none of this would have happened.
Okay.
All right.
Abby I'm really sorry I tried to trick you, but I just want what's best for you.
One of us has to! - You know, that is your problem.
You think you're better than people and you always try to fix them.
No, I don't! - Yes, you do.
You've done it your whole life.
It's annoying.
You know what? Yes.
Yes.
I would like to fix you.
No I would love to fix you! But I'm done trying.
Because you're not changing.
And you don't think or care about other people at all, and I do.
And that's why I don't want you living in this loft.
(scoffs) That's honest.
You're a garbage person and you should live in a Dumpster with rotten snails.
Hey! Nick! - Too far! - Yeah, way over the line, buddy.
Yeah, but I thought we were just piling in That's my sister, dude.
I didn't mean that, yeah.
Sorry.
Well, lucky for you, I'm moving out.
Oh, thank God, Abby.
Oh, my God.
You're really gonna like this place.
It's so nice - I'm moving in with Schmidt.
What what's that, now? You're moving in with who? - Seriously? - We would have sex all the time.
(chuckles) Dinner was lovely, you guys.
Thank you so much.
Bye.
What? - Schmidt: Ooh.
Hey, uh, Jess? Can I borrow your glasses? We're gonna role-play as you guys.
Ew.
No.
You don't understand.
She's not gonna be you.
I'm gonna be you.
Ugh! Get out, Schmidt! Get out of here! Okay Oh, God! Winston: What's up, my man? I took the test last week or should I say, I took the front part of the test last week and, sir, I am here to finish what I started.
What? What he's trying to say is, he took the entrance exam, but he forgot to do the back half.
Well, the test is administered on a computer.
There is no back.
You took the test on a computer? I choked.
I am a failure.
I am a loser.
I am never gonna amount to anything.
I'm never gonna sh**t somebody.
Dude.
Have some dignity, all right? Thank you for your time, sir.
Coach: Winston.
Winston! Yo! Winston! Dude, you failed, man.
You failed hard! At everything! - Dude, this pep talk sucks.
I'm not finished.
Like, seriously, it's like the Winston of pep talks.
Look at me.
You can do this, Winston.
Because now there's nothing to be afraid of.
You h*t rock bottom, man.
This is the worst it's gonna get.
Sir, it has been my dream to become a cop.
And no one's gonna stand in my way not you, not him Hey, I was helping.
and definitely not myself.
I would like to retake this test.
Well, there's one at 7:30 tomorrow.
Man, what about my last score makes you think I'm ready to take this test again in 12 hours? Coach: He'll be there.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you for messing everything up and being such a terrible liar.
Uh, you are very welcome.
I think I really needed to say that stuff to my sister.
She's gonna wreck Schmidt.
Oof He has no idea.
I'm sorry my family's so crazy.
Crazy? Your family's not crazy.
My family's crazy.
My father used to trade horse semen.
I've got an uncle whose God-given name is Shifty.
(laughing) Well, thank goodness we're the sane ones.
(chuckles) So - Okay, now, remember: Up, and - Uh-huh.
(screams) (elevator bell dings) Hello, Abby.
Hey.
S'up? Have you thought about what you're gonna do if they pair you with a dirty cop? Well, then, I would just go to Internal Affairs.
Well, that's a good way to get k*lled.
Then at least I would die a hero.
Hmm, no, you won't.
They'll put you in panties and then they'll plant you next to a d*ad prost*tute.
That's a poor lady.
It'd be a dude.
But it's awesome! Good luck on the exam! They got dude prost*tute? Nuh-uh.
Hey, guys.
Bertie's playing it cool, but you guys coming over for dinner tonight is a really big deal to her, so Be there by 6, and no bailing.
Ooh, bailing on dinner.
Nick, I need you.
Wingman sitch.
Jewish girl, sensible nose.
High-level target.
I can't be your wingman.
We got to go this Bertie dinner.
Don't make it seem like a chore, okay? She is making ten or eleven soups.
And all of them are cream-based.
Cool.
Hey, Mom.
Hi, baby, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I know the morning is the most sensual time of day.
But, um, I need you.
It's your sister.
Abby? What is it? She was arrested at a hotel in San Diego.
How's everything with your sister? I mean, she was caught stealing, they called the cops, it's a mess.
Imagine me next door with a, with a nice Jewish girl.
Hey, Jess has a sister? - Yeah, I've never met her.
I need you to go to the jail, pick her up and put her on a plane home.
Oh, that's fabulous.
And by the way, um I don't know what kind of jail this is.
So be prepared for anything.
I mean, wear a shirt you don't love-love.
Okay.
Love you.
Hi Nick Okay, here, these are all the ladles that I could find.
Ooh, this one is deep.
Well, what's up with your sister? Well, she's coming to town.
Great! - Ooh, yikes, that's The best news ever? I know! It's so, so, so, so, so, so, so good.
Well, I can't wait to meet the mysterious Abby Day.
Not mysterious.
Jet setter.
You know, I always imagined her with a French-speaking black husband, like a Jerome St.
Pierre.
So, I'll probably meet her at the airport for a little layover hang.
Why are you ignoring me, Nick? - 'Cause I'm paying - Nick! - attention to my girlfriend.
There, a reaction! Thank goodness! Now I know I'm not a ghost.
All right, I got to go.
Oh, you're going? I'll, uh, I-I got to go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jess, Jess! What if I came with? Yeah, you know, I don't think - you two would really get along.
Why not? Look, I just haven't seen her in a really long time, and Jess, I'd like to meet your sister.
Why don't we do this? Um Why don't I go pick her up? And then come meet us for a quick dinner before she leaves? That would be awesome.
That's all I was looking for.
Yeah.
Okay.
Winston, we can't make your dinner! - Bye, Winston.
I'm not gonna be with you.
Wait! No, no, no, no! Wait Hey, hey.
Are you really letting Nick meet Abby? Hell no.
I'm going to pick her up from jail.
Like, straight-up jail.
I told Nick he could meet her on her "layover" but, whoops, her flight got changed.
No time.
Sorry.
Bye, Nick! I'll see you later! - I'm out of shampoo! Gonna use bar soap! But your sister won't know the difference! Okay! Can't wait for you to meet her! He's never going to meet her.
Hey, dude.
I can't go to this dinner.
It's a double date now.
Things are already weird enough between me and Cece.
Because you went on a date two months ago and she never texted you? Yeah.
Be a man, Coach! - All right.
Be there by 6:00 and bring a bottle of wine.
And don't be cheap, either.
Bertie is a Somalian.
Okay.
Oh, tidings, Abigail.
I'm Jess's beau.
My name is Nicholas.
It's a pleasure to - Oh, good God.
Is that a common barber's comb? - Look, Schmidt, I just want to make a good impression on Jess's sister.
Yeah, well, I want Julia Child not to be d*ad, but here we find ourselves.
What did you come here to talk to me about? As I was saying earlier, I have a very difficult flirting situation here.
I mean, it's a double black diamond: trees, moguls.
And, as we both know, you're the best wingman who's ever wung.
Thank you, Schmidt! I'm almost glad I got in the accident so we can have more days like this together, with you helping me through this.
Hocod a guy so rich be so generous with his time? Whoa Excuse me.
Are you the writer of So You've Mastered the Female Orgasm, Now What? - Incredible.
Can I have your autograph? - Of course.
Come on, man.
It's a quick party.
I'll have you back by your little dinner.
Okay, I'll do it, but as soon as Jess says I've got to go, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
For your mitigated support and tiny portion of your life.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey, Abby.
Oh, look who came to pick up her big, bad sister.
So, you good to go? Or you gotta sign yearbooks or something? Bridget stole your gum.

Oh - Gum? I want my Fruity Fruit! I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch! What about the new guy? I want to meet him.
We don't really have time to meet him 'cause I have to take you to the airport 'cause Mom's already bought you a ticket.
I know all of her credit card information, - No.
and I can just change it.
Wait, what are you doing? Wait, no.
Sweet.

Did you just start driving really slow? No, I actually think I'm speeding.
I hope there's no coppers around.
Drive faster.
Sorry, sir! Thank you for your service! - What is this place? - It's a bar mitzvah.
I am not watching a kid get circumcised.
The target is Rachael.
She's a Hebrew school teacher.
Crashing some random kid's bar mitzvah's the best way to get her? Get her on the dance floor, a little bit softer now, a little bit louder now, sweep her off her feet, we'll get married, we'll have a son named Elon.
At his bar mitzvah, I tell the story of how I met his mom at this bar mitzvah.
Not a dry eye in the house.
Jewiontinuity, et cetera, et cetera.
Do you realize how long you were just talking? There she is.
Whew! - A beautiful piece of hamentaschen.
What the hell is hamentaschen? Problem is her dad is my rabbi.
He hates me.
So I just need to charm Rachael before he gets to her and tells her horrible-slash-true things - about me.
Absolutely.
Oh! Hello! - What a day.
Oh a special day.
Oh, take my hand.
Take your hand.
A special day.
You just wanted to take my hand so you could say that again, didn't you? Mmm, I did.

Remember when we used to be best friends? Uh, that was neat.
What a neat time in my life that was.
Hey, Schmidt! My girlfriend's embarrassed of me.
Can we go on that for a little bit? Or does the wingman never get to, you know, flap his wings? The bird never gets to be the main bird.
This.
Ugh! So, I just talked to Nick, and this is a real shame in the pants, but he's not coming home tonight.
What? Why? - He had to hang out with his work friends.
He can't come and see me? - Guess it's just us till the airport.
Mmm.
You see what you're doing, right? Oh, my God.

Not sure my body's built for these chairs.
It's a regular chair, man.
Yeah.
Hey, bub.
How you doing? Well, I want to apologize.
Sorry I got distracted.
It's okay.
I'm sorry your girlfriend hates you.
Ah, she doesn't hate me.
She's just ashamed of me or something.
Well, you know what? If she's really ashamed of you, then then she's the stupidest bitch in the whole wide world.
Easy.
Okay, slow down.
I apologize if I went overboard.
Water under the bridge.
I've never been ashamed.
Wish I could have helped you get that girl, man.
Feel like I blew it.
Well, she was kind of nutty.
What happened to us, man? We used to be the best in the biz.
We still are.
I'm the best wingman that's ever wung.
Make a plan? - Absolutely.
You're my brother.
Thank you.
Charge that to room 304.
Ah! You! Charge that to nothing.
She's checking out.
Adding this hotel to your rap sheets? You found me.
Oh, yeah.
Don't you want to know why I left? You saw my text, and I'm I'm honestly sorry, but you do ruin everything! Whoa.

Get your ass in the car.
I'm taking you to the airport.
Thought we could share some calamari.
Now! - Kobe beef sliders? - Now! - Lobster quesadilla? Right now.
This is a great Mmm.
You know, Bertie had a dream she k*lled me.
So, uh, Coach, what's new? Nothing.
Isn't that right, Cece? Hmm? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you'll figure it out.
If not, just text me.
Or don't.
You're good at that.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
We made out once, pointlessly, for two hours.
That's it.
Get over it.
Let it go.
Pointless was it? - Yeah.
I mean, who does that?! Super-hot make out, and then, you ice me out for two months.
What are you talking about?! Ice out what? You text me, "Happy Monday.
" What do I do with that? Oh, I don't know.
Maybe have a happy Monday.
Going out with you was the hottest and dumbest mistake I ever made! It was the hottest, dumbest, sexiest mistake I ever made.
It was so dumb of me to pick you up and press you up against that wall.
So dumb how cool those bricks made my skin feel.
You guys should try the fisherman's bisque.
Has just the right amount of tang.
That tang? - Mm.
That's tang.
Okay.
Whoa! Whoa.

Now what do we do? Maybe just, like, lower your center of gravity, and then this is gonna work.
Just lower it down, I'm gonna clench my thighs.
I'm gonna fall.
I'm gonna fall - I'm clenching my thighs as hard as I can.
Okay, okay.
What? Oh.
Geez.
Oh! - Geez.
That was awful.
That was the worst.
Oh, my gosh.
Wow, what is happening? - Oh, Lord.
Maybe you were right not to text me back, 'cause that was embarrassing.
I'm sorry.
No, that's cool.
Can we just be friends now? You know? Yeah.
I mean, why not? Friends? Friends.
Friends.
Come here, you.
Oh, oh! - Aah! Sorry.
I'm sorry.

Literally just bit my tooth.
I'm sorry, when I get excited my teeth come out.
Who does that? - Sorry.
I think I broke my tooth.
Let me see? Oh.
Okay.
Go straight to the gate.
Look I get why you're mad at me.
Okay? But if it's any consolation, I'm a woman in my 30s about to get on a plane to go live with my mother.
It's only a matter of time before I have a tiny denim backpack, too.
I said I would never go back to Portland.
So I guess I'm a complete failure.
I'm the baby.
Is this the craziest thing that's going on in the airport? Really? Okay, recap, you h*t the dance floor, and Do what I do best, be an embarrassment.
Well, it's a gift, Nick.
I need you to ruin this bar mitzvah.
What do you say, just get out there and do some weird dancing? - It's got to be bigger than that, man.
Bigger than that? Then I come out there and I knock you out.
It's all right.
Again, it'll be a stage punch.
Don't worry.
I've done several productions of West Side Story.
I know.
You told me.
As a Puerto Rican Shark.
Da, da.
That's cool.
It was awesome.
You never came and saw it, but - Well, I was very busy at that time.
Whatever, never mind.
The rabbi will then come out, he'll thank me, - the hero - Gotcha.
He'll offer me his daughter's hand, then, five years from now, Rachael is pregnant with Elon's little sister and we're having a beautiful family New Year's then in our vacation condo - in the Florida Keys.
You're doing it again, you're talking in speeches.
You've been monologuing, lately, Schmidt.
Do you s Do you, do you hear yourself? - I-I'm unaware of it.
You Okay.
I'm not gonna get mad at you, 'cause I respect you and you're one of - I'm unaware of it.
But, like, it's weird.
I apologize.
I'll stop doing it.
Okay.
Hey.
Yeah? Light this cannon up so I can sh**t off.
Oh! Well, well, well, it's a snake in the grass.
How you doing? My name's Nick.
You know martial arts? Swear to God you don't? You run around with this hunk anymore, this little surfer cat.
I know your game.
Charming the ladies with your baby blue eyes.
I wish I had 'em.
Breaking my heart, beautiful.
What? And I all do is love you.
I give and I give.
I been working for 40 years at the steel mill for you.
We just met.
I want to rip that blouse off you and put it on me.
Oh, wow.
I want to wear your lipstick.
Well, that's interesting.
I want to rip those earrings off and put 'em on and I want to be the girl! That would be wonderful.
But I won't do it around all these crazy Jews.
And I don't care who's watching.
I want what I want.
Ooh! - Unhand her, sir.
Whoa, what is Hey, man.
That's my mother! Ooh! You okay? Nice sh*t, Dr.
Nussbaum.
Would you like to date my daughter? She's available.
Oh, great, yeah, tell the whole room that I'm available.
I'm not telling the whole room.
I'm telling Dr.
Nussbaum.
A doctor.
No, I got that.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
I like your glass What happened to your eye? I got b*at up at a bar mitzvah.
And I know that's embarrassing, and I know you're too embarrassed of me to introduce me to your sister.
What? - And I get that, Jess.
Nick, that's not at all what - You know what? There is something I just cannot shake, I been tossing and turning all night long.
We literally have been apart for like I am your wingman now, Nick, because it-it takes two wings - Don't do this.
for a, for a bird to dance.
Jessica Day, you are dating a champion.
I agree.
And I don't know why on earth you would be embarrassed of him.
Don't I told him not - Excuse me? I don't understand where this is coming from.
I am not embarrassed of Nick, - not at all.
For real? - No.
Well, that's great news.
I'm glad that's out of the way.
Fantastic.
I'll see you guys for brunch.
Why would you think that? - She's embarrassed of me.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hey.
This is, um - I'm Abby.
Abby.
Hi.
Mom was right.
He does have an uptown butt.
What? - I'd like to put that butt in ski pants.
What does that mean? - Nothing.
Everything.
Come on, Abby.
Oh, come on.
Jess, I'm putting my stuff in your room.
So that mean you guys are gonna stay in your room.
Thank me later.
All right.
Well, she is just a delight.
So I might have told a few lies about my sister.
She's a total train wreck, and she was in jail.
Well, look, why lie? You know how many Millers have been or are currently in jail? I get it.
It's just, she's such a I can hear you.
Complicated person.
Right.
Anyway.
She needs me.
Right.
Can she stay with us? Yeah, of course.
How-how long? A few weeks.
Few weeks.
A month, tops.
Six months, super tops.
Six months.
Just till I get on my feet.
Oh.
What's your address? In case I want to get any "deliveries.
" I'm not telling you.
I'm not telling you, I'm n "Deliveries?" No.
Deliveries are fine, "deliveries," no.
Depends what you want "delivered.
" I'll figure it out.
Well I love you.
This is why I buy my food from gas stations, Jess.
Nick, you knocked over a wheelbarrow full of fruit, and then you actually skipped away.
Guys, I'm trying to concentrate, okay? The LAPD does not offer entrance exams every single day.
Just Mondays and Fridays.
But I am not waiting till Friday.
Hey, why do you have so much fruit? Because this one ran into his ex-girlfriend at the farmer's market.
Nick? Hey! No way! Caroline of my past.
What a pleasant surprise.
My ex-lover No! I don't deal with exes.
They're part of the past.
You burn 'em swiftly and you give their ashes to Poseidon.
I'm really good friends with Berkley, and we had a terrible breakup Come on, what? You have a good relationship with him because he wants to bone you.
He's a stay-at-home dad.
His entire life revolves around his family.
He's the most emotionally evolved person I know.
And I'm sure his favorite emotion is the emotion of wanting to bone you.
That's not an emotion.
Possible sex is the only reason people stay "friends" with their exes.
Come on.
Back me up, Winnie the Bish.
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, I'm friends with all my exes - See? - families.
Ha-ha! See? I still send Shelby's dad a Father's Day card, and he still sends me five bucks on my birthday.
What is wrong with you? - That's nice.
Hey, guys.
I bet Coach is friends with his exes.
No.
Oh, for sure, yeah.
Yeah! I'm right! - For sex.
No! Ha-ha! I'm right! Can't spell "sex" without the "ex.
" Man, is that sexy when he does that.
Announcement: I finally finished my loft.
Hold the applause.
Let's go.
All right.
Come on.
C-Come on, you guys.
All together, now.
We're not Who's coming? Let's go.
Come on, Nick.
I don't want to go, man.
Thanks for the invite.
Nah, come on.
Winnie.
No? You and Caroline still need some closure.
Well, what do you want me to say? That I walked out on her and now I'm dating you? We started dating, like, a year after you broke up.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter with her.
She's got a crazy streak, and this is bound to set her off.
What if she hurts me physically? What if she hurts me with words? Just talk to her.
Clear the air.
You'll feel better, she'll feel better.
Besides, Nick, I can't give up that farmer's market.
Strolling around, chatting with vendors It's so nice.
I feel like Don Corleone.
I think a lot of ladies do.
Hey.
Hey Sorry about that.
Haven't spoken anybody all day.
Phlegm buildup, you know? I've been cooped up all day in my loft apartment.
So much space for one person, you know? You could scream in there, nobody would ever hear you.
I'm gonna go.
Bye.
What is going on? May I speak plainly with you, Cecilia? I'm in a bit of a sexual drought.
The Good Valley Schmidt hasn't seen rain in months.
You're just you're giving off a creepy vibe.
All right? Living alone is messing up your game and it's making you weird.
Yeah, but I love living alone.
Where are you, grapes? Grápés.
Great apes.
Grapes, we have you surrounded.
Come out with your stems up! I guess my game could be upped if I increased my my human contact - a little bit.
Good.
Because you're caressing your own arm right now.
Hmm.
That's not normal, man.
I've been working out.
It feels I don't I just want to know why you walked out.
Was there something else going on? Was there someone else? Can I just say, I really wish this coffee was a giant beer.
And I wish this scone was a-a whiskey and I could just drink one just chase 'em.
This is nice.
Glad we're doing this.
So how'd it go? We gabbed like a couple of washer women over the back fence.
That's great.
So proud of you.
You two are dating? I knew it.
I knew it was her! What? You didn't tell her we were together?! I told her we were together.
I'm not getting away with this.
I didn't tell her.
Screw you, Miller! I don't understand.
You guys talked for 30 minutes.
How did our relationship not come up? - 'Cause I got scared.
There were so many things that I wanted to tell her.
You ever thought how weird it would be if you just gave up your thumb? You just didn't have a thumb.
I mean, how would you give a thumbs up? Just like this? I think a guy d*ed in the building, 'cause one day in the Dumpster is a bunch of clothes that just fit me.
What I like to do now is take the Underground, yeah? Spend my quid.
Cheers? Oh, crap.
This is her.
She thinks I cheated, Jess.
You know who you should talk to? Berkley.
He's so good at this stuff friendship, closure.
Actually, he did write a book about it.
It's an e-book.
I gave it four stars, but it kind of falls apart at the end.
He goes into God in a way I don't think he needs to.
You know what? I'm gonna text him? Why would I talk to your ex-boyfriend about my ex-girlfriend? Well, you need his help.
You're right.
Give me.
Can I see? - No, no, no.
Can I see? - Yeah.
Yeah.
"Hey, babe" Don't call him "babe.
" It's just what we call each other.
"BF problems"? My boyfriend is having problems.
XOXO? - It's a really common greeting.
"Kissing you, hugging you, kissing you, hugging you"? What else am I gonna write? "O-O-O"? That just looks like "Oh" You're leading him on, Jess.
Oh, Nick.
You are.
Berkley's really gonna teach you a lot.
Men don't talk to people they've dated unless they want sex, or they're Winston.
I also want sex.
Going to Schmidt's.
He's been begging us to all week.
Jess, men are sick.
Look, I'm a relatively good guy, but even I'm a sicko.
Luckily, we have the Internet as a community of Oh, this is terrible! She's quoting scriptures, but using tons of cuss words.
This is as bad as it gets with Caroline.
Okay.
Berkley's around the corner at his baby's world music class.
Okay, you know what? I'm in.
Great.
What kind of beer does Berkley like? - He doesn't.
Oh, great.
I cannot wait to meet him.
Fellas.
You made it.
As promised, here's a coupon for a free sub.
Yup.
Probably get ham.
Wow, man.
It's nice inside of here, man.
Yeah.
It's like a European airport.
Oh, what's that? Uh, you want to watch the game? Which one? Basketball? Football? Of Thrones? Oh! That is awesome, man.
Look at this place, Schmidt.
You got so many plush surfaces.
Well, there are 15 different bang spots in here, each one specifically designated to its own sexual position.
Mm.
That's standing, this is sitting, that's diagonal.
That's how I do it.
The "Why? Why? Because.
" The "Closure of the Lincoln Tunnel.
" The "Red Beanbag Chair.
" Which is pretty obvious, but, you know, that's a good one.
The "Glass Menagerie.
" - The "Bike Share.
" - Nice.
The "Backwards Oops.
" What is "backwards oops"? You don't want to put it mm.
You don't know what it means.
I mean, I don't I've done it, I've done it, but I didn't know I was doing it.
You know, it was Super cool, dude.
I wish I had my own place.
Guys, mi casa es su casa.
I even made you guys keys.
What? Check these out.
That one's yours.
Aw, it looks like a guitar.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're rocking.
Mine's a It's a rainbow kissing a star.
You like it? - Blah! Yeah.
Guys, hang out here anytime you want.
Even now.
Who's thirsty? - Thanks.
Right there.
Dude! - Shut up! - Damn, man.
You're like James Bond.
But I'll be I'll be Moneypenny for sure.
Yeah.
Wait, which one is Moneypenny? It's the woman.
Oh.
So, did the store have that, uh, bamboo highchair you were looking for? No, not the one I wanted.
So I think I'm just gonna Order it online.
You still got it.
You still got it.
Big deal, I've been online, too.
I still got it.
It's different.
So, this is the problem.
Nick didn't tell his ex that we were together, and she found out, and now she's really, really upset.
This is the scariest one yet.
It's just a bunch of smiley faces.
Okay, um, not to be all guy with a baby, but, uh, exes are really a lot like newborns, okay? The burps can be so yucky, but you know what comes after a burp? What? A big old smile.
Aw.
What the hell are you talking about? It was a metaphor, Nick.
It was a classic fatherhood metaphor.
No, my-my point is you just need to face her and let her get it all off her chest.
Oh, I feel like I've done that.
No, you didn't.
You just talked and talked about nothing for 30 minutes.
Okay, look, I know it's hard.
I know that, man.
I'm here and I'm hearing it.
I mean, when Jess and I did this, I think we cried for, like two days? I mean, at least.
But look.
Now I have such a good friend, and we talk all the time, and he's such a good listener.
Say what? I can't hear you.
Is this real? You guys saw each other naked, and now you're friends? Yes, it's the purest form of friendship.
Straight Leno and Eubanks.
I just want to say you're incredible, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Okay, I took your advice.
What do we got? "My bad.
Let's be friends, 'kay?" Smooth, but tough.
That's not good, Nick.
Friendship is a, um it's like a beautiful flower.
You have to nourish it, okay? - You can't just buy it at a store.
All right.
First of all, it was a draft, okay, and I'll fix it.
And second of all, with all due respect, you can buy a flower at a store.
Millered! I know as an angel you usually sleep in heaven, but would you care to spend the evening at my place? I think maybe I would.
Fantastic choice.
Here's my address.
There's usually no place to park.
Well, so where would I? You're a big girl.
You'll figure it out.
Uh, just tr-try south of Sixth.
There's usually a string of open spaces down there.
And there's not a right turn on red on Fifth, just FYI.
Okay, here's the deal.
I've been wanting to end things with Claire for years now.
And I'm gonna do it.
It's gonna take one phone call.
What? - She's gonna burn all my clothes on the lawn.
I don't care.
I only want to wear Henleys anyways.
Jess, we can finally be together.
What?! Wait, no, but leave your wife?! For you.
I'm gonna leave my wife for you.
Wait, what? "Thank you for being so incredible.
" "So lucky to have you in my life"? - Jess.
Mm-mm.
When you said those words, I knew.
No.
Berkley, there's been a fundamental misunderstanding here.
You know the last time Claire thanked me for anything? It was when I was pulling out her chair at our wedding.
No - She doesn't appreciate me like you do.
No, it's not happening.
No, no Aah! Damn it, Winston! Oh, God.
Pretend this is attached, and there's water coming out.
Okay.
No, not like that.
It's not sexual! No! I'm not feeding you water! - Wet my mouth.
No! Oh, hi.
Are you Schmidt's friend? - What? Sch-Schmidt's friend? Where you at? 'Cause I'm ready to ea Hey! My good friend Frank Scabopolis! Ah, give me a hug, you Greek son of a bitch! - Come here! - What? Where is this coming from? You.
The phone calls, the texts, "Boyfriend problems," "I need you," hugs, kisses.
What? - More hugs, more kisses.
I - You have been setting up dominoes for ten years.
And now they are falling.
You have a baby, sir! I know.
And you are gonna make such a good stepmom.
I love you, Jessica.
God, it feels good to say that out loud and not just to my sleeping wife.
Guys, I need your help.
You, hey! Nick was right about you, and he can't know that, - so put a sock in it! - What is wrong with me? - Hi.
Hey.
I keep trying to write to Caroline, but I'm choking.
I can't get past "What's up, C?" Oh, that's her.
It says, "Come to the window, friend.
" Friend.
That's good.
That's good.
That's a good thing.
Yeah.
Caroline! Hey! You cheat on me and then you want to be friends?! I'm just writing you an e-mail! It's-it's not sending! Look, gonna throw it down, but I need my phone back! - We talk now! - Caroline! Hey! Stop! Really excited to - No! - talk to you guys.
Hey, stop! That's not my car! Tell Jess I said hi.
No, Caroline, I parked down the street! It Why am I telling you?! At least she can't get into the building.
Okay, what am I gonna do here? She cut off the power.
No, Nick, that was you.
You turned off the light.
All the other lights are still on.
My bad.
Thank you.
I know you're scared.
Let me be brave.
You should go because you have a wife, and you have a baby, and you love them.
Jess, what are you, crazy? It's not safe out there.
Berkley can't go.
He stays here.
I don't think that - Thank you, Nick.
You're very welcome.
I'll be with you in just one second, all right? - Mm-hmm.
And don't drink the water by the bed.
It's got my contacts in it.
Okay.
What are you doing? - What are you doing? - And t-tell her that I'd like to be reimbursed for those strawberries.
What? Dude.
Why is she calling you Schmidt? I told her my name was Schmidt in case we saw your mail.
I don't just leave mail out.
This isn't a small business.
Get out.
Dude, I'm about to seal the deal.
I'm not getting out.
I'm about to I'm-I'm a deal sealer.
I'm about to get some squish, dude, and you need to not get in between that.
I'm about to nail it into the wall.
Dude, I'm about to take down that va-dragon.
I'm about to pin the tail on the va-donkey, dude.
You better not stand in the way of this.
Don't call her a va-donkey.
I don't even know her well and I want her to leave, but please don't call her - a va-d va-donkey.
I won't.
All right.
Please.
I need this.
Okay, fine.
I will use the guest room.
Yes.
Like an animal.
Oh, yes.
Oh! Winston! What are you doing?! Oh, we were just playing a game.
You know, Bad Cop, Black Cop? It's me, Bertie! Um, I might have been wrong about some things, um, some Berkley things.
Hey, the screaming stopped.
I knew she'd run out of gas.
"My bad"?! - What? "Let's be friends, 'kay"?! You couldn't even write out "okay"?! It's go time, Nick.
Time to break out that burp cloth.
Jess, let's give him some space by going to a motel.
I don't love you.
I got a slight beer buzz.
Let's do it.
Yeah, don't go.
I thought you wanted me to talk to her.
Don't go right now.
I'm sorry.
You don't love me? Say it again? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh What?! Then why have you led me on for ten years? Oh, hell on Earth no! Oh, my God, I was right.
He wants to bone you.
Oh, come on, Nick! Caroline, I'll be right there.
I'm so sorry, Berkley.
You got cut off.
Thank you, sir.
No.
May, 2004.
You brushed my hand at Dave Matthews concert - during "Two Step.
" - "Two Step"? - Oh, my God.
Or that time that I helped you move, and I came over, I was wearing sweatpants.
You couldn't stop staring at my rig.
She loves looking at rigs.
Why are you calling it a rig?! You're doing it again.
One second, Caroline! Open this door! You think I wear this sweater because I like it? It's a handsome sweater.
That's right, I love you.
No! What do you mean, no? Ooh! Open the door! Come on! Schmidt? You said to me that I was incredible and you were so lucky, and now here we are, we're trying to hook up Nick with his ex-girlfriend.
I mean, that's what this is, right? No, it isn't.
That's not what So let's just do it, come on.
Hey, hey, - Berkley, Berkley! - Oh, no! - No, no! - No, what are you doing? - Oh, no.
'Kay! - Oh, hey! - Car-o-line.
Yeah You stole my boyfriend.
Schmidt? Be right there! That should buy us some time.
Coach, you stay with your girl who thinks that you're me in my bedroom.
Winston, you stay in the guest room with Bertie doing whatever the hell it is you guys are doing.
Gross.
I'm gonna keep Sarah Almost there! I'm gonna keep Sarah in the living room, using one of the living-dining-open-floor-plan bang spots.
Now, no exits, no entrances, no Noises Off baloney.
Capeesh? Confirm my capeesh! Capeesh! - Let's go.
Do it.
All right.
Guys, guys! - Right.
This is the exact type of baloney that I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.
Guys, guys! I'm really glad that we're doing this.
Okay.
All right.
I did not steal your boyfriend.
Timeline.
Now.
Okay, um you and Nick break up.
London has a great Olympics.
Uh-oh, trouble in Syria.
Board up your windows.
Superstorm Sandy.
Hey, over here.
Me and Nick get together.
And here's that beautiful Sunday in the park that you and I went to, and we have a wonderful Sunday.
Shut up, Berkley! - No, you shut up, Jess.
Don't take this out on Jess.
Oh, oh, right, it's the beginning, so you're being all supportive now.
He's still trying.
I mean, I bet he's still laughing at all your jokes, right? Well I have a great instinct for comedy.
All right, well, you know what, you enjoy all that while it lasts, because I'll tell you what.
It's not gonna be long before he stops holding your hand and starts high-fiving you and he stops letting you be the little spoon and he starts drifting off during important conversations.
Are you listening right now? What's that? - Seriously, Nick? - Jess, you're the girlfriend now, but one day you're gonna be the ex.
And two years after he breaks up with you, he still won't tell you why.
Um, okay, well, um this has been a really, um, neat talk, so, um I'm gonna go sit in the shower, and, um, go over the greatest hits in my mind.
I'll just be right here, picturing the whole sudsy thing.
Hey, hey, ho, I'm right here.
How about a little respect? I know.
What, you This is obviously happening.
No, it's not! Where's your brain? Hey, Jess, you okay? No.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
I've led a very fortunate life.
Look, Jess, you were right.
No, you were right.
I feel like such a fool.
You were right about everything.
No, I wasn't.
Caroline deserves to know why I left.
And you should hear, too.
I'm thirsty! Stop! Let me go, boy! - No, no, no, come, come Whoa! Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? Schmidt.
What? Frank Scabopolis is up in here making out with some bitch.
That's not necessary.
I mean Who's Frank Scabopolis? Aren't you Schmidt?! I-I am Schmidt.
I thought you were Schmidt.
I am Schmidt.
Uh Uh, w-we're brothers.
We are, we're-we're brothers.
What an upbringing that was.
Yeah, same mom, different dads.
One browner.
Then who the hell is Frank Scabopolis? Yeah.
I am Frank Scabopolis! Is this helping, Schmidt? I forgot the plan.
Winston, please shut up.
Plan? What plan?! I there's no plan.
I know nothing about a plan.
Is this some little nasty group sex games y'all got going on up in here? Been a couple years, but I'm down.
I didn't want to know that.
I am out of here.
I'm way ahead of you.
No, no, please! Sarah, please, wait! I can ugh.
Just Well, I'm gonna go back to bed.
Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.
It's pretty good.
See? You don't think I'm scary, do you, baby? - Oh, whoa! - Oh! No.
Hey, no.
I was just kidding.
No.
Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.
Nick, you don't have to do this.
No, I-I do.
Look, I never cheated on you, but I might as well have.
See, I fell in love with Jess the moment she walked through the door.
Boo! - Really? Sorry.
The moment I walked through the door? Really? 'Cause I thought I annoyed you.
Can we do this later, please? - It's just not a good - Yeah, okay.
Got it, yup.
Got it.
Caroline, she's the reason that I left.
I always thought that it was Jess.
I'm glad I'm not crazy.
Well Hmm.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
Oh, I'm just sorry it didn't happen sooner.
Don't touch me.
I'm so sorry.
I was kidding.
There's that famous Milwaukee humor.
I'm not from Milwaukee.
You honestly scare me.
Good-bye, Nick.
Bye.
Hey.
Look, Berkley, um, I'm so sorry that you got the wrong idea about us.
You were right.
I did play some part in it.
Thank you.
Good luck, Jessica.
Thanks.
See you later, bud.
I really don't want to go back to my wife.
Do you guys want to play cards or something - Go.
Just go.
Get out of here.
The moment I walked through that door, huh? Just be cool about it.
'Cause for me, it was way later.
Yeah, I know.
Like, a lot later Oh, come here already.
You could use that for something.
That's the "Glass Menagerie.
" - Yeah.
I'll sit her down right on top of that.
Oh, absolutely.
The, uh, "Star 68.
" Where's that at? - Right there on that pillow.
Oh.
Wow.
The "Jumanji.
" Yeah, you do the the "U Lock" on here.
That'd be cool.
The "Jean-Michel Basquiat.
" Oh, okay.
The "Fabric Softener.
" That's the "Kansas City Shaker.
" - This, right here? I like that.
Yeah.
Back there, that's the "Nia Vardalos.
" - Ooh.
That's nice, dude.
Nice.
That one's "Sex on the Rug," which is and, again, it's pretty obvious.
But that's you know, why mess with a classic?
All right!
Yes!
Don't touch my shin every time there's a big play.
Yeah, no, I got it.
Oh, yes! - Don't touch it every time! Hey, man, stop.
Oh! - Oh! There it is! - No! - Hey, Nick.
Um, Jess left her panties in the dryer.
You mind if I move 'em? - Sure, man, I don't care.
Wait a second.
Why do you ask? You're not gonna move them in a weird way or something, are you? No, dude, I'm just trying to be respectful, that's all.
You know, before you and Jess were together, I moved her panties hundreds of times, so - Wait, what? - Hundreds of times? What, are you just hanging around the-the dryer like some sort of panty-hawk? - What? - Panty-hawk.
I'd watch that show.
So should I just go move them, or Nick, he's being weird.
You gotta move 'em.
Oh, so now I'm the panty mover? Yeah, you're the boyfriend.
That's not a life! - Who the hell is gonna move the panties? Coach, you move 'em.
Are they warm from the dryer? You know what? You're out.
Grow up.
I'll move the panties.
Thank you.
Ooh, seems awfully eager.
Yeah, you're awfully eager, here, Schmidt.
Oh, yeah.
I been waiting my entire life to move your girlfriend's panties Stop saying "panties," bro.
Panties.
No, they're panties.
With a "D.
" Pandies.
Pandies.
Say "panties" like a normal person.
No, this is how black people say it.
Pull your "pannies" down.
No "T" in there.
We say "pannies.
" Yeah.
Here's how a white dude says it.
Pull your panties down.
Guys, honestly, can you not see what the panties are doing to us? Stop saying "panties" when it comes to Jess, everybody.
This is exactly why none of us should live with a woman.
I've got an idea.
You guys are never gonna believe what You know what? I don't care.
The most amazing thing just happened.
Whoa! Hey! - Hey! - Watch where you're going! - Oh, boy.
Sorry.
Sorry, my bad.
We thought we were gonna die, but she was actually really sorry.
So she invited us to a party at her boss's house, and they're sending a limo, and guess who her boss is.
It's Prince! - It's Prince! - It's Prince.
It's Prince.
Prince! It's Prince! - What? - Oh! Prince? - Nice! We're going to a party at Prince's house, - We're going to a party - We're going! at Prince's house.
We're going! That's not my underwear.
Which shoes should I wear to Prince's house, white or black? White, or black? Nick, come on.
The limo's gonna be here any minute.
Which shoe? White or black? Well, I think you look great in everything.
I just want this moment to end.
What are your open-toe options? None of it works, okay? We gotta start over.
Let's go.
You failed, bro.
Man, I am glad I'm not going to that party.
Too much pressure, am I right? Dude, in high school, going to a Prince party would've been your dream come true.
You were obsessed.
So tonight we're gonna party Like it's 1999! My mother had to cut those pants off me, they were so tight.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to celebrate this thing called Schmidt.
Nick, are you wearing cargo pants? - Yeah.
You're gonna wear those to an A-list party? Hey, guys, how are we going to transport all this cargo? Oh, wait, we have Nick's pants.
We're saved.
Get the frickin' pants off.
Dude, we're not going.
Prince invited the hot girls, not the four dudes.
What? Why did I buy this $2,000 suit? You idiot! Dude, my suit cost $200, and mine came with socks stapled to the lapel.
Not gonna tap that.
I'm not gonna 'Cause it came with it.
Cheap suit.
Yeah, but it came with socks.
Unacceptable! This party was supposed to take me to the next level.
Next level of what? - Don't ask, man.
In every man's life, there is one party that changes everything.
Oh.
You don't understand.
And that is exactly why I'm leaving you all behind.
So this whole time, you've just been waiting for cooler friends? Yes.
Of course.
Coach, look around.
This can't be the finish line.
Here she is.
Whoa! You look great! Why is Schmidt dressed up? I don't want to talk about it.
Prince! Unbelievable! Hey, look! I'm in a limo! I wish I had really long legs so I could stretch 'em out the length of the limo.
Well, have fun.
I love you.
Hmm Mm-hmm.
Did Nick just tell me - he loved me for the first time? - Yeah.
And did I do finger g*n back? Yeah, you did.
No - Yes.
Oh You're gonna want to drink all of this.
Oh, oh! - Hey, driver, we're gonna need some more champagne! Ah.
Okay.
So Yeah Dude, a man never says it first, okay? Well, it wasn't my plan to tell her, it just slipped out.
She looked so pretty.
Well, Nick, is that how you feel? I mean, do you love her? Of course I do.
But I wasn't gonna say it like that.
I was gonna wait, Winston.
You blurted it out.
It's not a big deal.
That's what I always do.
I love you! Sometimes they say it back, sometimes they don't I mean, it's like a numbers game.
I always do this.
I always get too intent, and then I freak girls out.
I blew it.
What do I do? Well, Nick, you can't take it back.
Well, that's not 100% true.
Damn! Prince's house! Not bad, Prince! You think Prince has a pool? You think he has a drawbridge? We're never gonna get in.
We're not even in a limo.
Uh, excuse me, we're in a Ford Fusion, the best car ever made.
It gets double the gas mileage of - Again? - Shut up.
That's all you've been talking about the whole drive, and it's weird.
You get sexual when you talk about it.
It's in your eyes.
I don't like it.
Double the gas mileage means you go double as far.
Double as long.
Shut up! I'll let you borrow this, dude, and you'll feel it.
You'll know what I'm talking - Why don't I feel it right now? - Feel it.
Oh, cowabunga! - You felt it? - I'm gonna punch you in the face.
Just drive the car.
You've never been turned on by gas mileage before? - Never.
No! - Once.
When was that? - It was a Thursday, that's all I remember.
A Thursday? - Yeah.
Just drive the car.
I gotta go tell my girlfriend I don't love her - so she doesn't leave me.
All right.
Like a normal person.
Amazing.
Can you believe it? No, I can't.
Finger g*n? That was so stupid.
My brain just froze.
If the limo guy hadn't pulled away, I probably would've done a lasso.
I think you were just a little scared.
Scared of what? Saying "I love you"? I say "I love you" all the time.
I'll say it right now: I love you! I love you.
Hi, I'm Clayton Kershaw.
I'm a Los Angeles Dodger.
Yeah, and I'm Jessica Day.
I'm a Los Angeles astronaut.
Not now, pal.
He's never gonna let us in.
So what do we do? Pull it together.
I need this as much as you do.
My new life is waiting for me in that party.
Guys, look, I can't help but think that now might be a good time for a little f*re and Ice.
Oh! f*re and Ice! - Please, do not There is never - a good time for f*re and Ice.
Yes! Yeah! f*re and Ice got you into parties in college, but it's not getting you into Prince's house.
Winston, what happens when you mix f*re and ice? Warm water, baby.
This is embarrassing.
It's bubbling.
It's bubbling, baby! - Warm water! - Warm water! - Warm water! - Warm water! Um, yeah, I'm on the list.
Ernie! Winnie?! Winston L.
Bishop.
Ernie, is that really you? Oh, my goodness! Come here, man! My God, it's so good to see you! This guy saved my life, man.
No, you saved my life.
Let me ask you something, man.
You still keep in contact with Freddy? Freddy didn't make it.
Freddy's gone? No! Come on! No! No, man! - We ain't crying.
No, you cry, I cry.
This is a great night.
Hope nothing ruins it.
That's nice to see.
Come on, you guys.
For Freddy.
For Freddy.
That's remarkable.
That worked? We need our own f*re and Ice, pal.
Well, all right, man.
Ham and Cheese! I don't really think the name made a Ham and Cheese! - Nick! Well, we should rehearse! - Excuse me.
Excuse me! - What?! Who's this guy? - Nick Miller? - Is that Schmidt? - You scoundrel, you.
Well, hot damn.
Come here.
It's good to see you.
Yeah, well, the feeling's not mutual! The last time I saw him, I was on the desert, and he was putting my mother into a prison.
You don't understand what we're doing, do you? Keep this animal away from me! You know what? It's my fault.
We didn't rehearse.
We didn't rehearse.
Can we come into the party? You know what? We're gonna wait back here.
I get it.
It's my fault.
It's - Nick? - I'm Trojan horsing inside a bunch of models.
Every ham for himself.
No, Nick! Let me in there! Models, let me in, please.
No, sir.
Unhand me!
Jess? Hey, there you are.
Excuse me.
Jess.
Nick, hi! What are you doing here?! - I'm so happy to see you! - Yeah.
How'd you get in? - I need to talk to you.
I know.
I can't leave it the way that was.
I know, because there's something, um, I really should have said back there and I didn't, and, um I think it's important that I say to you.
So, uh, what I wanted to say is, Nick Miller I Jess! She's all right.
Hey, Jess, you okay? Hi.
What happened? You had a panic att*ck and you fell down.
Oh, my God Which is actually worse than finger g*n.
I didn't think that was possible.
I think it's fair to say that I did not handle the situation very well.
No, look, it's fine.
In fact, I want to take the whole thing back, Jess.
What? I shouldn't have said it, it was an accident and, uh yeah, so just kind of clear the air.
No! No, Nick! This just got very awkward.
Be strong, Nick! What did? What? - What's that? - I'm outside the hedge! You see my arm? I'm trying to push through! What are you doing up there? Be careful! I lost my bearings! I had to go high to avoid the spiders! - Nick - Just wait for him to finish.
I'm breaching! - Uh - Whoa! Easy! Easy! Aah! Aah! Oh! Prince is terrible at Frisbee.
There's, like, ten of these things up there.
Hey, guys, can I talk to Nick alone for a second? You got it.
Yeah.
You're taking it back? Is that how you really feel? Well how do you feel? Hi.
I'm Prince.
So what seems to be the problem? Oh, how rude of me.
I haven't given you enough time to freak out yet.
You may do so now.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nick! So, I'm not familiar with this term "finger g*n.
" Can you elaborate? Uh, yeah, it's a Whoa.
Don't point those at me.
They might go off.
That was very much of your flavor of humor.
Listen, Nick, uh Nick, right? Yes, that's my name.
Jess and I are gonna take a moment to just be alone.
I'm-I'm not worried, but why? What are you gonna talk to her about? You.
Nick, I never thought I'd say this, but I need to be alone with Prince.
All right, well Yeah.
So, do you like pancakes? Ooh, ooh.
Cece, help! The bouncer's after me.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
He's gone.
He's gone, Schmidt.
Is he gone? - Mm-hmm.
You can stop now.
He's tenacious.
He's definitely gonna be back.
Pretty sure it's all clear.
It's always good to see old friends.
Thank you.
So, tonight's the night we're just gonna leave this all behind and get cooler friends, right? Yeah, right.
We should be d*ad.
We should be d*ad.
I never thought I was gonna see him again! He's getting emotional right now, because this is real.
Oh, if you cry, I'm gonna cry.
And then I'm gonna cry, then we can just cry together.
Poor Freddy.
Jess is with Prince! And I've been drinking.
Wait Jess is with Prince? And I've been drinking.
Who are these two? Come on, man.
f*re and Ice, dude.
Get out.
It's getting warm in here isn't it? - Yes.
It's actually a little chilly.
We're Oh, give me a break.
I see what you're doing.
Mm-mm.
You're trying to tempt me sexually.
Not interested.
What are you doing, Nick? That leads to me taking my jacket off, and all of a sudden, you guys got me in my underwear, huh? I'm not a dummy.
Take a walk.
No one's interested.
So rude.
How idiotic.
We got business.
Rude? No, no, no, no, no, no, stay, stay, stay.
Let's go.
Idiot! Yeah, I'm an idiot.
Ciao.
No, no, no ciao! No ciao.
You'll be replaced by robots before you can say, "Fragi-cava-licious.
" You're bringing f*re and Ice down! Yeah, man.
You don't bring f*re and Ice down.
Don't start with me right now.
I'm having a terrible day.
Who cares about them? Who cares? I care! I feel like dancing right now.
Dancing's not the answer.
You can't dance.
It's only gonna get worse.
Let's tear the roof off this joint, and show Prince how we do! Thanks, Charles.
You want to know why you can't tell that nice dude you love him? I want to say it, but You're scared.
Exactly.
If you say it and things don't work out, what then? I really care for him.
And I'm just worried I'm gonna lose him.
That's stupid.
You're stupid.
I forgive you.
Oh, my God, thank God! - Besides anything beautiful is worth getting hurt for.
Well, that's very well put.
You know who said that? No.
Me.
You're good.
God.
I wish I were more like you, Prince.
Finish your pancake.
Let's get to work.
Oh, it's really good.
But I'm super full.
Pancake.
Okay.
Here, put this on.
Oh, that's beautiful, but I don't think I could pull that off.
Don't argue with me.
Okay.
Repeat after me.
Love.

What am I supposed to be learning here? - Love.

You're not saying it right.
Do you understand now? Yes, I think I do.
What about now? No.
No.
Look in there.
Wait, stop, no! I'm afraid of the dark! I said stop being afraid.
Boo.
Yeah! This is what sexy is! So, what do you think? I think you need to go find Nick.
I don't know how to thank you.
Shh.
I honestly didn't hear a word you said.
Okay.
Okay, gotcha.
This is your party now.
To the VIP room? - Yeah.
With the two of you? You can't handle it! You can't b*at me! Come on.
You've got it.
Boy, you don't got it.
You can't do it.
You're gonna do it.
Three - You can't do it.
Two - He's gonna do it! Come on, now, you can get it.
Winnie, don't give up.
What? - Damn it.
That's impressive.
New record.
Surrounded by celebrities and millionaires, and you dingbats are playing Lemon Mouth.
Rind me, woman.
Really? - Okay, here we go.
Let's do it.
All right, let's go.
Let's get this party started.
You got the time, Winston.
Check this out.
All right, let's go.
Here we go: Ten, nine, - What are you doing? - eight What are you doing? Boom! - What?! - You're not supposed to eat the lemon.
New record.
That's not even the game! Nick Miller! Hey, Jess.
I'm not sorry that I said it.
I hate to say this, but I couldn't hear you 'cause it's very loud.
I love you! I love you, Nick Miller! What the hell are you wearing? Prince dressed me.
Awesome! Yeah! Anybody want to fall in love tonight? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Fall in love tonight She said Special night, my favorite tune The moon thr*at to dance her out of her shoes Out of my shoes In his ear was about to hear An awful thought he could not refuse She said - Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight She said Underneath the taffeta There ain't no better hiding place Hiding place If I see the moon, I'll just laugh it up Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah - Want to wake up - Wake up To your, your pretty face - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight? Did that happen? - Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
So we just danced with Prince? - With Prince.
Yeah.
That's right.
That was fun.
Jess, how did you know the words? I think Prince is magic.
I've always thought Prince was magic.
Where do we go from here? How do we move on from this? Just go to work tomorrow? Wait a minute.
Where's Cece? - I'll take it easy on you.
Thank you.
You want to put some money on this?
That's so cute! Bum, bum, bum! Birthday Eve Cocktail.
Oh, my God.
You're my favorite bartender.
Thank you! Oh, my God.
What is that? Is it not good? I'm still learning how to make drinks.
I'm better at sh*ts.
Want a birthday sh*t? I think I'm good.
So, any special birthday plans? No, she's just gonna go to the movies alone, as usual.
No, I'm not, actually.
Uh, this year Nick asked me to spend the day with him.
That's so sweet.
I mean, what are you gonna do? Something special? Maybe.
You know, whatever Nick wants to do.
I'm not really a birthday person.
Please.
I do have a lot of expectations for people.
Happy birthday.
Oh, my God.
"Made in China"?! Are you taking me to China?! And that's why, a long time ago, I decided that I would spend my birthday alone at the movies.
It's just safer, you know? No getting your hopes up, no getting let down.
Well, I know how you feel about movies.
I mean, my parents took me to see Witness and then they never came back.
What? - I can really quote that movie though.
"Be careful out among them English.
" But enough about me! I am talking your ear off, lady, and it's your birthday.
This year's gonna be different.
Maybe Nick has something big planned, maybe not.
I'm gonna be chill.
No expectations.
Low maintenance.
No maintenance.
I'm just gonna be one of those cool girlfriends, like in the movies.
She just, like, has bed head and she wears, like, men's shirts and she's just like, "Yeah, cool.
"I'll wear, like, men's shirts and, like, sneakers and stuff.
And, like, I don't care about how I look.
" Hey.
Hey.
She has no idea about the party.
Uh, Winston's STD-free.
Whew! It was a close call.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Close call, y'all.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
Do you guys know how hard it's been for me to keep this party a secret? Nick, it's been an inspiration, and that's why we're gonna help you cross that finish line, okay? This is our Rudy.
Very condescending but thank you.
Right on.
All right, team check-in.
Coach, where we at with decorations? - I forgot.
Wait, what? Psych! I'm the best at stuff.
I don't forget stuff.
First place! Wait.
Why are you first place? I dominated on cake patrol.
And thank you for getting that cake.
You don't have to add the "patrol.
" Decorations beats cake.
Uh, no.
Cake definitely beats decorations.
Oh, really? Let's do a word association game, okay? - Yeah.
I'm in, I'm in.
Birthday.
Decorations.
Wait, what'd I say? Okay, Schmidt, are you ready to transport all electronics to the party venue? By "electronics," you mean this itty-bitty flash drive that I can fit in my pocket and that is light as air? I need a verbal confirmation.
You insult me.
Yes.
Cece, you ready to cover my shift tomorrow with Mike? Born ready.
Yes.
Oh.
You're giving your Saturday to Cece? That's cool.
That's really wonderful.
Can you tell I'm being sarcastic? - Absolutely.
Yeah, it's pretty clear.
I'm ready.
You set f*re to soda water.
Who does that? How do you even possibly do that? It's not a flammable thing.
It's not even Are you a witch? Mike I hate all of you hipsters so much Okay, and I'm gonna be on Jess Watch.
I'm gonna make sure she doesn't see anything that will ruin the surprise of this party that has taken everything from me, emotionally and physically and financially.
So what do you have planned for the day? A big surprise party.
Next.
Right, but before then.
The party's at 7:00.
What do you have planned b-before that? - Wait - Nick, you need a plan, okay? I don't care what Jess says.
She's going to expect something.
I have to plan a birthday before the birthday? The whole day is the birthday.
This is a very big deal.
This is your first birthday together as a couple.
All right, you know what? It's gonna be okay.
It's her birthday.
That girl's gonna want to sleep in.
My day is not starting till noon.
This is the time I was born.
I'm wide awake.
It's my birthday.
My day started earlier than I thought.
I got to slow down breakfast.
What's going on with you guys? Nick, first of all, blessings.
Um, second of all, there may have been a possible mix-up with the cake.
Possibly.
"See You in Hell, Boomer"? Oh, my God What part of you thought this was Jess's cake? I thought it was an inside joke.
I'll do the cake.
No, I am the cake patrol.
Both of you do the cake.
I'm considering this problem solved.
Hey, speaking of problems, do you want me to go check up on Cece at the bar today? I don't think that's necessary.
All right, I'll do it.
But you owe me one, bro.
I need to make a 90-minute omelet.
I love my birthday breakfast.
I can't believe you were gonna make this all yourself.
It would've taken you hours.
I know.
And with your help, it took six minutes.
I know.
I'm so fast.
What do you say we go into my bedroom and, uh, slow things down? Ooh.
Wow.
That's the fastest it's ever taken.
I know.
You just look very pretty.
So, you want to take a long nap? Oh.
Um If that's what you have planned, then, yes, let's take a long nap.
Perfect.
Maybe for, like, six, seven hours? Hmm It's just such a nice day outside Yeah.
Um, so let's take, uh let's take this party outside.
Sure.
Next up on the agenda is it's lunch.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God, it's so early.
What are you doing here, Schmidt? Nick thought you might need some help.
Yeah, well, I don't, okay? So you can go.
Maybe I'll just stay for a little bit.
Double-tap some Insta-G's.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Mike.
I cleaned the glasses.
Oh, wow, a bunch of broken glass in the ice tub.
That'll be fun for me to clean up.
I'm sorry.
Um I'm not gonna cover for you like Nick does, okay? I promise you that.
And don't make eyes at me because it's not gonna work because I'm super gay.
When I look at you, I just see You know, it's fine, but it's bumpy, it's creepy.
Eh.
Doesn't do anything.
It's like looking at this, it's like a it's-it's-it's-it's-it's it's not o it's not a good it's not good.
Okay.
This, all this, everything you got, eh.
Three out of six.
Damn shame about that cake, Winston.
Looks like someone dominated their party task.
"Coach, where are all the kazoos?" All over your face.
I'll pick those up.
Or maybe in my spare time I'll make a cake.
Just back off, Coach.
What's up, Nick? - How's the cake situation? - Cake's good.
Can I just see the phone? - Can I see the phone really quick? Got it.
Dude, get Hey.
Cake's good, man.
I'm on top of it.
So, how's your plan working out? Okay, I have no plan.
I'm just winging it, okay? I panicked and took her to a drugstore.
She's getting a free diabetes test.
I don't know where to take her.
Is it safe to bring her home? - Hey.
Oh! The birthday girl! I got the test.
My blood sugar is normal.
Already? You did that all that already? - Yeah.
Birthday girl gets, all your favorite Next activity.
I see what you're trying to do here, man.
You're trying to show me up.
What are you talking about, Bish? I'm referring to basketball.
When we used to play back in the day, no matter how open I was, you never passed me the ball, you never let me sh**t.
You just couldn't stand to let me shine.
Your nostrils are flaring so much right now, it's distracting.
I'm done letting you run the court.
I'm building my own court.
And it's gonna be bigger and yummier than yours.
Are you challenging me to a bake-off, Bish? Yes, I am challenging you to a bake-off.
Okay.
Well, then, I'll do the countdown.
You know what? I'll do the countdown then.
The countdown begins when this timer goes off.
You set the timer for 20 minutes.
I'm gonna make a cake so moist, girls are gonna be, like, "Ew.
Why do you say moist? I hate that word.
" I'm gonna be, like, "Just taste the cake.
" And they're gonna be, like, "Damn, it's moist!" And - Bake! - Okay, bake! - I said it first.
I said it first.
I said it first.
I said it first.
A customer ordered an old-fashioned, and she got gin in a mug with a peanut in it.
I'll fix it.
Make me an old-fashioned right now, or I'm gonna call the manager.
And I want to talk to him anyway, because he's just gorgeous.
I want to be a barnacle on his ship.
Just hanging on by my mouth, getting all the nutrients I need.
Okay, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned.
If it's old-fashioned, it probably has something like - absinthe - Oh, the old-fashioned.
One of my favorite drinks; a classic cocktail.
Just a half ounce of simple syrup.
Splash of water, two dashes of bitters.
Mix that up with some ice.
And then, you know my personal favorite.
You know, and just, far be it from me, but the bourbon whiskey.
Bourbon.
Two ounces of bourbon whiskey.
No.
Hmm.
It's not the Scotch whiskey.
It's No, it's certainly not the vermouth.
Vermouth would be insane.
Yes, the bourbon whiskey.
My favorite.
Wonderful.
Look at that.
Old-fashioned.
Hmm.
Old-fashioned?
Oh, my stars and garters, you made a drink.
Holy crud.
Yes, Nick! I have the electronics! Do you know any, like, time-consuming and free activities in Griffith Park? Gross! su1c1de? Schmidt, please.
I need some a Well, just figure it out, dude!
Oh, it's my mom.
Okay, um, found the biggest rock I could carry.
It was this one.
Um - It's heavy.
It's huge.
Yeah, heavy.
Oh, my God.
Um what are we doing here? It's not that I'm not having fun, 'cause I am.
It's okay if you didn't plan anything for my birthday.
Are you kidding?! Really, Nick.
Not only did I plan something, but my plan's about to blow your mind.
Honestly.
You need to trust me a little bit.
'Cause everything is about to be made very clear - very soon.
Oh, my God! What? Nick! - You're the best.
I'm amazing.
I'm so surprised! - I'm so surprised.
This is amazing! - It's amazing! - This is amazing! Yay! - Oh, son of a bitch! - Oh! - Don't touch anything! - It'll ruin the surprise! Yeah.
Yay! - Yes.
Yeah! - Yay! - Hey, Jess, let's get out of here - before anything ruins this perfect moment.
Ooh! I wouldn't t Wait because we've got a whole, uh, ceremony.
No! That lady took my birthday! What is happening? - Jess! Look, look, I'm sorry, Jess.
No, no, no, Nick, I just I don't know why I get so crazy about birthdays.
You know, it's crazy, 'cause you had a very fun day put together.
Eggs and sex and and a really long uphill walk.
And, um look, um, that's amazing for you, you know? For me? You're not a guy who plans things.
Maybe I am.
Look every day, you show me, in your own way, how you care about me.
Like when you pick up rubber bands on the sidewalk.
For your ponytail.
I could not be more fine.
I'm super chill.
I'm just gonna go home for a second.
Bye.
Jess, let's keep Jess! Don't follow me.
Sure you know how to tap a keg? - How hard could it be? It's beer, for crying out loud.
It's the drink of idiots.
Wait.
Nick told me something about - Cece, look, I got I got it.
Ooh, there's a knob back here.
I got it in.
He told me if I turn this, I shoulde able to - Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, no! - Turn it off! - Oh, sorry! It's just - Turn it off! Oh.
You butt hole.
You can't do anything right, can you? I'm so sorry.
He's right, though.
I can't do anything.
No skills.
I told you this, but I didn't even graduate high school.
A lot of people never graduated high school.
Okay-- Einstein, Bill Gates, Anne Frank.
I'm gonna take back that last one.
Why did I think that I could bartend? Because you can.
You are strong, and you are confident.
Those are skills.
Use them.
And be a little bit meaner to the people here.
It should be easy for you.
Just pretend that they're me.
You're right.
That is easy.
And pull your shirt down a little bit.
This isn't a monastery.
Do not push your luck with me.
I'll look away.
You're wearing paper towels.
Behind! No it's an environmental-friendly, recyclable apron.
Behind! Behind! - Okay, real really? Okay.
Behind.
Behind.
Behind! - Behind! Behind.
Whoa! Behind! - Behind you! Behind! - Behind! Behind! - Oh, so you - Behind! - Behind! - Whoa! Behind.

Hide the cake.
Hide the - I'm great.
Behind.
How's your day going? Going good? - You're crying? - Oh.
I'm taking - Um - I got mine off first.
No, you didn't.
Rest up over here.
What a day, guys.
Really long, huh? - Yeah.
Bet you had a long day, huh? I'm really fine.
It had a real day, you know.
I'm disappointed in Nick.
Yeah, you got to let that out, you know, 'cause But I'm disappointed in myself because I'm disappointed in Nick, you know.
Oh, I feel you.
Yeah, that's messed up.
Yeah, let it out.
Let it out.
I'm getting up.
Oh! Jess - No, no, no Hey.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Want you to close your eyes, breathe deep, and go to the most magical place on earth-- your imagination.
Have you guys been baking? Ah, nah.
Bakery downtown exploded.
Don't look into it.
It's not on the Internet.
Yeah.
She is here.
What happened? She doesn't think I can do anything or plan anything, and it feels like crap.
Maybe she's right.
Why did I think I could pull this off? I'm pretty sure I'm having a heart att*ck.
And I haven't arranged for anybody to clear my Internet history.
I wasn't building a b*mb! I was just curious.
Nick, you got a whole team of friends pulling for you, okay? Just get yourself home.
You can still pull this off.
Hey, Mike.
-What? - So I cleaned out the beer trap, I polished all these wine glasses, and I turned that penis graffiti in the bathroom into a whimsical hat.
Now my friend and I have to go to a party.
All right, Schmidt, let's go.
You called me your friend.
Did I? And now, look, no matter what we see in here, I just want you to know that it's been an honor working with you.
You, too, man.
Oh Wow, look at that.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
Our, uh cakes merged.
Looks as if they have.
Yeah.
Well - Hey! - Aah! - Ah.
Ah.
Team check-in.
Where we at? Our cake became double cake.
Yeah.
Two cakes.
Yeah.
Two cakes became one? - Two cakes, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Fantastic, I'll go get Jess.
Cool.
Nice.
Hey, Jess.
Hey, guys! What's up, man? She's at the movies.
This might actually work.
At the what? - Come on! More, more.
More.
Uh and, okay.
I think we're good.
Same to the second one.
Hey, Jess, it's, uh, Nick.
You obviously knew that.
Um, I know this is where you always go on your birthday to be by yourself, but I thought this year you might want a little company.
Mind if I sit? Look under the seat.
Now please read the card, I'll wait.
How did you know I was gonna be sitting here? I put one under every seat, - but you got to go fast, 'cause of the timing.
Okay.
"My name is Jess, I like to wear tights.
It's dark in this room, so let's turn on the lights.
" Surprise! Whoo! That's enough.
Timing, guys, timing.
In the beginning, there was nothing, and then there was light and dark and oceans and birds and stuff and then there was Jess! Nick? This was the plan all along? What do I think of when I think of Jess? When I think of Jess.
Okay When I think about Jess I think of how sweet she is and how smart she is.
uh, is glasses and the hair thing.
think of dance parties and sleepovers Jess does not like being tackled.
The eyes, two eyes.
Happy birthday, Ms.
Day.
Your youthful exuberance exhausts me.
May it fade with each passing year.
Well, she made me try papayas.
That was cool.
They're super soft inside.
Jess is the upstairs lady.
There is a there is a ma You make mistakes.
Happy birthday to my best work friend.
Tina, if you see this, I'm sorry.
I just feel like we drifted apart after Jeremy's cocaine thing.
It was awkward.
"When the stirrups of life start to feel like the speculum of old age" Nick, I'm not reading this.
Happy birtay, Jess.
Your boyfriend is sweet and simple and will not get out of my waiting room.
I saw a squirrel once.
It looked like Jess.
Then it att*cked my sister, So I had to b*at it with a stick, and then it didn't look like Jess anymore.
Happy birthday.
It's Bearclaw.
Birthday Winston is about to do some He said a bunch, but it was really weird and r*cist.
Happy birthday, Ms.
Day.
Yay! What I remember most of all is the pain.
Honestly, it was 36 hours-- more than that-- of just searing, ripping, and then Out you came, the most beautiful, beautiful little baby I ever saw in my life.
And I forgot all the pain.
When you were born, I got a deli sandwich at the hospital cafeteria.
And then there was a baby.
Happy birthday to my oldest and my best friend.
Happy birthday, Ms.
Day.
Happy birthday.
Birthday.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday from Bearclaw.
I love you.
Happy birthday.
Happy, happy birthday.
You have a cool boyfriend.
This is the coin I had in my pocket the first night we kissed.
And I always have it.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday to you Cha, cha, cha.
Happy birthday to you Ooh, ooh Happy birthday dear Jess Um hmm, where'd Where'd she? Where'd? Hey, Jess, I'm so sorry.
That was cheesy, embarrassing.
I didn't have great talent to work with.
Winston was terrible.
It's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
And I'm sorry.
Shh, shh.
It's starting.
Happy birthday, Jess.
That was so stupid, dude.
Oh, what is wrong with you? Ashamed of yourself.
Come on, Schmidt.
Quit it.
Boo.
No!
Oh, snap, snap, - Oh, snap, snap.
Wow - That sounds pretty good.
Thank you.
Hey, listen.
Schmidt, I've been kinda stuck on this whole career search thing.
Oh.
You think I'd be good at advertising? - I mean, that's what you do, right? - Advertising is a dog.
Drinking beer.
A fat moron falling down the stairs.
A snot-nosed brat kicking his rapping grandpa in the testicles.
The rapping grandpa kills me, though.
I am in marketing, Winston.
The backbone of capitalism.
Without it, you'd be d*ad in two days.
I could be good at that.
Probably not, but you can shadow me at work today to find out.
Yeah! Team drug store, back from mission.
Drug store, right, Coach? - Yeah.
Uh, can I have my bag? - Yeah.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
Thanks.
So, same time next week, right? Team drug store? We'll go again to the drug store? Team drug store? Ugh! God! What a walnut! It's been two months we've been living with him, and I have yet to cr*ck him.
It's like we just spent an hour together.
It was, like, nothing, no connection.
And don't tell me it's in my mind, because it's not.
We ran into one of his friends, and Coach said the meanest thing about me.
Check these out.
Can you believe these are for glaucoma? She's my buddy's girlfriend.
You are my girlfriend.
What's the big deal? I want him to think of me as his friend.
Oh, I hear that.
Well, it'll happen if it's meant to.
I need to find a way in.
I found a way to force myself into all of your lives.
You just didn't know it.
Food, clothes, Onesie pajamas.
I like the butt flap.
You really think mine was food? I can think of five other reasons I wanted to be your friend.
Boob, boob, vag*na, butt cheek, butt cheek.
In that order? Well, I'm not gonna say, "vag*na, butt cheek, boob, butt cheek, boob.
" - Yeah, but that's the correct - That's the order, yeah.
Season 3, Episode 12 "Basketsball"
Look, Nick, I need help.
Like, tell me about Coach.
Like, what's up with him? What does he like? What does he dislike? Well, Coach 101 is, he's watching basketball.
And that's all he's gonna do from October till June.
His team's the Pistons.
I mean, they were great in the '80s, but then we got Jordan.
Then they started getting good.
Then we got Thibodeau.
What you gonna do now? And he knows that.
That's genius.
Basketball.
That's my way in.
Basketball's not your in.
You don't know anything about basketball.
Come on.
You refer to it as "basketsball.
" Well, that's the technically-correct term, Nick.
There are two baskets.
I'm an English teacher.
Basketball's just the first step.
We sit down, we watch a game.
We have a few laughs.
Before you know it, we'll be digging into each other's pasts.
That's not how it works, though.
Childhoods, Nick.
That's the friendship money sh*t.
Men watch sports so we don't have to talk about childhood stuff.
No.
It's a real thing.
And the game doesn't even have deeper meaning.
Come on.
And there's no layers to it.
If I'm talking about a player overcoming the defense to win, - that's not like I'm overcoming it.
No.
Come on.
Not only that.
He's a Pistons fan, and I'm a Bulls fan.
Right.
I don't understand, no.
It's rivalries.
Sharks and cats.
Yankees, Red Sox.
Whales and dolphins.
Pistons fan, Bulls fan.
End of discussion.
I get it.
Jean Valjean and Javert.
Yeah, definitely.
This is like a Jean Vanjer and Vajer situation.
So, where do you do the marketing? - Oh, Winston, so sweet, so naive.
Where do we do the marketing? We do the marketing everywhere.
Now, you're gonna want to take notes on everything I do, 'cause you're about to see life happen at the speed of business.
Schmidt.
I have a task for you.
Hi, Kim.
We got a new guy, and I want you to show him around.
Wait.
Who's this? - Oh, I'm just shadowing Schmidt.
Called my bluff.
Don't care - Ed? Come meet Schmidt.
Okeydokey.
That's the new guy? "New" compared to what, the moon? Here's what happened.
Gwen turned 45, so we had to f*re her.
Obviously.
So, wait.
Gwen's job is available? Yeah, but then grandma turned around and filed an ageism lawsuit, so we hired Bran Flakes here to cover our ass.
Just do it.
All right, I'll do it.
Well, here I am.
Okay.
I'm Schmidt.
I guess they wanted you to learn from the best.
Well, actually, they said your office was closest to the can.
I got a prostate the size of an avacada.
"Closest to the can.
" - Do not write that down, Winston! Is it not closest to the can? Yes! Hey.
Whoa.
I stay sealed off during basketball season.
Plus, I, uh, dropped some olives under the bed, can't reach 'em.
Oh.
I got little pinchers.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yoom.
Hey, so I was gonna watch the, uh, Pistons of Detroit game.
Don't really have the reach for that.
Good thing I got legs.
Wait.
You like the Pistons? - Oh, yeah.
Just like you.
Are you serious?! - Yeah, I'm d*ad serious.
Aw! - So, you in? - Be cool to watch it on a big TV.
I found your olives.
Oh, you did? - Thought they were gonna be in a jar.
No.
This is a big part of the biz, my man.
Networking, face time, making deals.
Normally, this would have a much sexier, businessman's vibe.
But not when I'm dragging around this old drooling potato.
Potata? Yeah, I can split a baked potata.
What a life you must have lead.
Tell us about the street car, will you? Oh, it was a dynamite way to get around.
Mm-hmm.
Pasadena to to the beach - Hey.
I'll take another one of these.
Sure.
You know, Cece, I can't help but think that I am just following another bad lead with this marketing thing.
All I'm doing is taking a bunch of notes for Schmidt.
What's this? "Seems befuddled and totally lucid"? - "Smells too clean"? - Those were just notes about Ed.
I'll tell you what.
That dude is way more interesting than marketing.
If I'm gonna take Gwen's job and become the next CIO of Ass-Strat, I can't just embrace modernization.
I got to make babies with it.
Do you know what I mean? It's time to unveil my baby.
Micro-marketing.
Yeah, we target our messages directly to the individual consumer.
What a good idea.
They're gonna hold a ticker-tape parade for you in the Jewish part of town.
That's right.
In the Jewish part of town.
Mm.
Nothing but net.
Traditionally, "Nothing but net" refers to hitting nothing but inside of the net.
Oh? - Ah, so, yeah, no.
Oh, time-out.
Butt bump.
What? - I'm ready.
What? The butt? Oh.
Come on.
All right.
Hey! Hey! What is that? - It's the Pistons butt bump.
I didn't know your girlfriend was a Pistons fan.
That's got to suck for you, man.
But I guess everything sucks for you when you root for the Bulls.
Butt bump! Ah.
Ah.
Ooh.
Oh, cool, cool, cool.
So you're a Pistons fan now, Jess? - Suck it, Bulls! - Yeah.
Suck it, Bulls! The worst team in the League, the Bulls.
Oh, it's the worst team in the League, all right.
Who is the worst team in the League, Jess? The Bulls.
The Bulls are the worst team in the League.
Hey.
So, went really well today.
I think Coach and I are really connecting.
Come on, what is that? What do you mean? What? Oh, Coach gave this to me.
How cute is this shirt? Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm gonna need you to get out of my bed.
Why? Because of the shirt? - 100% because of the shirt.
Oh, my God, you're serious.
I can't have you in my bed in a Pistons shirt.
Oh, my God! - I need you to get out of the bed.
Jess, I need you to get out of there.
I tried being cool about it, but it's not cool.
Really? - Really.
Nick, it's just basketball.
Why are you taking this personally? Because it's personal, Jess! That's my team.
It's the city that I'm from.
It's most of my relationship with my dad.
R.
I.
P.
, by the way.
Michael Jordan.
The first man that taught me that I could love a man.
And the Pistons are our rivals.
They're like in Hamlet The McCalls and the Sh Hacksperes.
You're my girlfriend now, so You got to be a Bulls fan.
That's the whole point, Nick.
Coach just thinks of me as your girlfriend, and I want him to know me for me.
Do you want me to be friends with Coach? I-I absolutely do.
Yes.
So, then, why can't I be a Pistons fan until we become friends, and then I'll switch to the Bulls? So every year you can just pick a new team? You meet a new friend, you're a fan of that? - I could never trust you.
Can we just have sex now, please? I'm sorry.
You can't be a Pistons fan.
I forbid it.
It has to be this way.
You can't forbid me to do stuff.
That's just not you That's not within your power.
I just did.
The shirt stays! Jessica, you're leaving me no options here.
I'm gonna have to turn off the tap.
What tap? - The sex tap.
But I need my vitamin D.
As long as you're wearing that shirt, the tap is off.
No more hot water.
All right, fine, then.
My shirt and I will go sleep in my bed.
Oh.
What happened to your Pistons jersey? Did you rip it off and rush in here 'cause she got to have it? - Look, is this still a thing? - Oh, it's still a thing.
No sex for you as long as you're a Pistons fan.
You can't use sex to manipulate What are you doing? Just brushing my dirty teeth.
They're filthy.
Nick, do not challenge me to a sex standoff.
I can channel all my sexual energy into knitting.
How do you think I made it through high school? It's good when you go fast and then slow.
Make the teeth wait for it.
You're on.
Oh! Yeah! - Oh! Yeah! Turnover! - Dunk it from the downtown! - Go! Go! Go! - Pass that pumpkin to Josh Smith.
You better listen to my friend.
She knows exactly what she's talking about! Did you just call me your friend? What's up, guys? Ah, two minutes in, and the Pistons are already down by ten.
What a drag.
What the heck are you wearing, dude?
Just my Scottie Pippens.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, I'm just checking up on you.
You frustrated at all?
You need your vitamin D?
No.
Jessica - Three-point play! Yes! - Oh, yeah! - That's what I'm talking about! - We are talking about the same thing My friend and I.
Do my berries make you hungry? Mmm.
Refreshing.
Just drink the water, Nick.
You're turning yourself on now.
I really am, yeah.
Okay, next order of business is Kim, if I may, uh, present an idea very quickly to the group.
While I know - Micro-marketing.
What? Has this company ever considered targeting its message to individual consumers? Big data's knocking.
Let's open the door.
Just a thought.
Yeah, interesting.
Ed, look into that and present it to the board asap.
Great job.
I'd hug you, but you smell like a public library.
What are you doing? - I may be dirty, but I play old.
You said that wrong.
And yet I got my paw wrapped around your avacadas.
What is with you and avacadas? Sorry.
You're never gonna believe what Ed just did.
He s*ab you in the back.
Winston, that's exactly what happened.
How did you do that? I figured him out, Schmidt.
That liver spot out-sharked me.
Can you believe that? I'm-I'm a minnow.
Tomorrow, Ed is gonna present my idea to the board, and then he's gonna get the get the promotion.
My career is toast.
Minnow toast.
Yeah, well, I tip my hat to him.
The minnow tips his tiny hat to the shark, and then lays down on the toast to be eaten.
There is too much going on in whatever metaphor you're trying.
Okay? It's too busy.
Somewhat made se Oh, forget it.
Ed wins.
I'm a mess.
Hell, no, Schmidt.
Justice has to be served, all right? - Mm-hmm.
Right.
Let us stop Ed.
The minnow needs to get up off of No, off of the toast mat and fish-fight his way to the orangutan ball.
I just don't understand why they keep giving these games away! You know what it was? It was that turnover in the third quarter.
Right.
Yeah.
I'll show you.
I can just take your word for it.
Actually, let's do it from the beginning.
You want to watch the game we just watched all over again? - Mm-hmm.
With both overtimes? Great.
Looking for somebody? - Just doing a bed check.
And you are accounted for, so - See you.
So, how's it going? You guys bonding over basketball, Jess? We're actually this close to moving past basketball and into real friendship, so - Great.
I'm feeling pretty good about it.
After the Pistons lost, did he get really sad and talk to you about it? About how he felt and you guys became besties after? Or did that not happen because that's not the way men are? The Pistons lost, so you must be feeling pretty good.
Oh, I'm happy, yeah.
Yeah? - You're feeling excited? - Mm-hmm.
Worked up? - Yeah.
Ready to cave? - Oh, I've never been stronger.
Oh, yeah? So if I just read you a description of Like, what a Piston does, you know, on my phone, it wouldn't affect you at all? Is that what you're saying? It's just a rod that transfers, uh, force from the crank shaft What is this, a seduction class for kindergarteners? Watch the master work.
How about this? A little Paula Abdul stuff.
Yeah.
Are we doing this? - Ha! - What are you doing? Ball's in my court now, pal.
I'm turning off my tap until you become a Pistons fan.
Hey, that wasn't part of the deal.
It is now.
I can't figure out my counterstrike, Winston.
The only thing we know about Ed is that he's old and cranky, and he baffles me because I'm so darn young and pleasant.
We just got to get inside into his old, cranky mind.
We have to find an older, crankier mind.
How are we gonna find an older, crankier mind than Ed? Hey, where are you guys getting your photos developed these days? I got these beefcake selfies that I want to dangle in front of Jess, get her engine revved up.
Your phone has a camera, Nick.
These are sexy, sensual, private pics.
I don't want them beamed right into Snowden's pocket.
I'm not going through Wikileaks, man.
It's not for me.
Analog.
It's the only thing you can trust.
You care to elaborate, you know, on this whole analog thing? No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.
Right.
The hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.
And then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.
Once the screen breaks, your information's in the Twitterverse, man.
And it's all out there for everyone to see, all these little monkey elves, man, all these kids.
That's all they do.
Get your information, man.
Bottom line is you can't control your technology.
That's what's going on in Japan with all those robots.
Not for me, man.
That's why I trust a hard copy.
Plain and simple.
Hard copy, Schmidt.
Nice work.
Thank you.
And, Nick, you know, if you're gonna be taking boudoir sh*ts, please consult me.
I know.
I have a series of poses that many people, including myself, find very sexy.
Okay, here's one that I call the half Nelson.
Yeah, I didn't do that.
This is called a Guy Fieri.
Just taste the sauces.
Yeah.
Black licorice.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Schmidt's d*ad wrong.
Oh, yeah? - I got some real hot pics in here.
I don't care.
There's one of me as a sexy mayor, looking out the window, deciding the future of my city.
It's got to get her going.
Daddy needs his cookie.
Dude, just wear the damn Pistons jersey.
Oh, my God, I've got to end this.
What time is it?! Game time! - Yeah! - Yeah! It's my favorite time.
Other than medieval time.
All right.
What the? - What the? - Let me see what's - Wait, no, I'll do it.
It's okay.
No! Oh, my God, a mouse Rat or s Uh, some creature.
I got to go watch it in my room.
Wait, no, no, no.
Coach, Coach, Coach.
Look, since we can't watch the game, why don't we just - Have a nice, long chat over coffee? - What? - You know, just talk, hang out.
What? And then coffee turns to dinner, and dinner turns to weekly dinner, and before you know it, I'm best man at your beach wedding.
Do we have to? We don't okay.
You start.
Me? Hey, you want to do this over food? Yes! Yes! No! No, no, no, no! No! Come on! Get your head out of your ass, so you can see where you're going, damn it! Okay.
What? - I have to say it.
Coach, I I don't like basketball.
What? - There's, like, no fun parts.
There's no themes.
Men should not be wearing t*nk tops, ever.
Why were you pretending to like basketball? 'Cause I wanted to be friends with you.
Dude, you're my buddy's girlfriend.
We're watching the game.
What's the problem, dude? What else do you want? No, you're right.
I'm just, um I'm just Nick's girlfriend, so - Enjoy the game.
Okay.
Where are you going? I'm just, um - Jess - Where Jess! Ladies, you all look like a hundred bucks.
I hope someone's taking you out for oysters Rockefeller tonight.
Now, before I begin, my little helper here will distribute some handouts for your reference.
Uh, you know what, Ed? I'm really sorry.
Company printers are on the Fritz, so Little helper that I am, I decided to load everything up onto the laptop.
There you go.
Well, I'm sure there's a printer that works.
I'll just wait for the hard copies.
I broke all the printers.
I'm gonna b*at you with an orange in a sock.
Besides, we're talking about technology, aren't we? Be a little silly to talk about technology without using technology.
Am I right, Kim? - Use the technology, Ed.
Hup-I-dip-I-dip My left arm.
My neck.
You got me this time, Hebrew.
But I'll be back.
This is why the cutoff's at 45, ladies.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Jess! You win! I'm all backed up! I've even been fantasizing about Winston! Where is she, dude? Don't do that laugh.
What are you wearing, dude? - It's for sex.
You like the Pistons.
Why don't you shut up, Coach? - Where's Jess? - What is up with that girl, dude? One minute we're watching the game, the next she's, like, calling me a jerk and storming out of the place.
She just wants to be your friend.
Any idiot can see that.
We were being friends.
We were watching the game together.
It was an awesome game.
Okay, maybe she wants more than that.
Like what? - You want to know a trick? - Absolutely.
This is how you get in with Jess.
You know when you're driving in your car and you have a random thought, like "I wonder if seals are friends.
" Yeah, or like "I really want to text right now, but there's a cop behind me.
" - That's not the one I mean.
"Why do T-Rex have little arms?" Don't finish.
Don't f I know you, don't "If they get an itch in their crotch, how do they scratch it?" I mean more like sweet, kind of emotional stuff.
Like, if you combed, you know, like, a gorilla's hair, would it like it? Like I've never seen a baby pigeon before.
Exactly! Tell that to her and you get a friend for life.
Now, excuse me.
Sex awaits.
Hey, Jess! You win! I want to take you! Respectfully! - Come here.
Take that Jersey off.
Actually, leave it on.
To Winston.
Hear, hear.
As a thank-you, I'd like I'd like to get you a job at Ass-Strat.
I'll make you a real Ass man.
I don't know, man.
I kind of liked the part where we just get to analyze evidence, you know.
Connect the dots a little bit, yeah.
Live inside of someone else's mind.
Spoken like a true marketing analyst.
I don't know.
You know, I kind of want to be free of a desk as well.
Well roam the streets a little bit.
Just sniff out clues.
Let me ask you something.
You guys get donuts in the morning? - You ever thought of being a cop? - Winston, I think you'd be great.
I can see it.
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
You've already got high cholesterol and weird people skills.
"Officer Bishop.
" - I like the way that sounds.
It would be nice to retroactively justify that mustache.
It's a hell of a mustache.
What does that mean? That was from a movie.
Training Day's my favorite movie.
I understand that, but you understand that's not what being a cop is.
I want to drop fools! Huh? That's what you're telling me? If you think this means you can start yelling at me You damn right, sucker! That's what that means.
Oh, I apologize about that.
Jess? Jessica Day-hey-ey.
I just want to say that, um, I would love to be your friend.
Look, I know I'm crazy about the Pistons, but it's just because Detroit was the city I lived in the longest as a kid.
Yes.
I lived in, like, six different states by the time I was ten.
At a certain point, I just Stopped trying to make friends.
Got real comfy on that.
Really? Lot easier saying bye to your buddy's girlfriend than it is your friend.
Well, I'm not gonna be saying good-bye to you anytime soon.
Except for right now.
You want to do a butt bump? Butt Ah, you're probably doing your own butt bumps.
Cool.
I know you guys are already done.
Well, nothing brightens up a rainy day like a Scotch tasting, guys.
It's not raining today.
It hasn't rained in months.
Shh, don't ruin the moment.
There's actually a huge forest f*re.
Dude, you should turn on the news.
This is a 15-year-old French oak reserve.
Mm! A note of cedar, vanilla, tobacky.
Boozy.
Hunting, fishing, sh**ting, fatherhood, bonding, sadness.
Please don't leave me.
Cheers, guys.
Put 'er there Schmidty.
Cheers.
Cheers.
To a nice quiet evening.
Tranquil.
This moment is so chill and absent of drama, I want to call it "Tim Duncan.
" I have 21 minutes to make a life-changing decision and you beautiful sons-a-bitches are gonna help me! - Whoa.
Yeah! That is $45 worth of Scotch right there.
It tastes disgusting.
I don't like it.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
So, obviously, Nick has told you about how I've been volunteering at the Children's Museum, and really hitting it off with the head curator, Candace, right? In my way, I have.
I've never heard that.
Hasn't said a word.
Thank God.
Come on.
Guys, give me one second.
I gotta go play a round of "Car Keys Monte" with Kevin-97 or he'll try to drive home.
So, anyway, about a month ago, Candace calls me and tells me there might be a full-time fund-raising position opening up - and I'd be perfect for it.
There we go, look for the keys, look for the keys, look for the keys.
And she keeps pushing me for an answer, and I keep putting her off.
I say, "Thank you very much.
I'm very flattered, but I already have a job.
Me teacher.
" That's a grammar joke.
You get it.
Look at the jukebox for a sec.
When I think of teachers, I think of two things: Jessica Day and p*rn where the characters are teachers.
Well, of course I've always wanted to be a teacher, but my school's a disaster.
Justice Brandeis believed that Ms.
Day? Education's Principal Foster, everybody! Thank you so much.
Ms.
Day, we have h*t a construction hiccup - in our renovation, so - Okay.
everybody's gonna have to be sharing classroom space.
What? - Oh.
Hey, do you have a freezer or should I flush these frogs? My check comes either way.
Oh, come on.
Foster's sticking us with the math kids that use letters instead of numbers? Do you mean algebra? I guess.
Anyway, it's gonna be a couple of crazy months, huh? I'm sorry? Months? Right.
Years if the bond issue fails.
Which it might, since voters are trending anti-future.
Anti-future? Who's anti-future? I don't know.
The Amish? The dying? Television industry, print media, record industry, railroad industry, karaoke machine owners.
You got this? I'm gonna go not smoke pot.
So my phone rings - Oh, we telling phone stories? Nice.
No, I'm talking about work.
So your phone rings.
And it's Candace officially offering me the job! And I told her I'd think about it! Wow, you not being a school teacher? Well, you have found my flabbergast button, and guess what, you've pressed it.
I'm flabbergasted as hell, too.
Look, I've been a teacher my entire life, and I've always wanted to be a teacher, but maybe I should be doing something else.
I don't know.
How do you know when you're on the right path? It's crazy.
That wasn't a rhetorical question.
Oh! - Oh! What I like to do is just take a drive up PCH maybe.
Willy Wonka once said Guys, Candace is calling at 6:00 to find out my final answer! - Whoa! - What? I'm sorry you're in such a pickle.
But I'm not sorry that I get to time something! - All right.
Just to be clear, 19 minutes until 6:00.
I'm not sure this is helping.
This brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation.
Yeah, because you're being timed now.
You time a lot of stuff, Coach.
46 seconds.
This is a life-changing decision, that's it.
Coach, do you always wear a stopwatch? Like always? You familiar with Rollergirl's relationship to her skates in Boogie Nights? - Yes.
Well, I'm not, because I don't watch movies, I time them.
They're p*rn, but they're also a family.
my round ass! Jess, choosing a career path is never easy, but what I found - Oh, my God.
Shut up, dude! She's looking for career advice.
Your job could be done by a vending machine.
Guys, don't be mean.
So Nick doesn't have a traditional career.
I mean Or is it the most traditional? Maybe I'm thinking about prostitution.
Guys, as you all know, I am the expert at changing career paths.
Is this something we're now bragging about? No, Schmidt, I'm referring to my decision to quit playing the game of basketball.
Jess, I will tell you this, it was not easy.
It all began back Come on, Winston move it along.
Okay, Jess, fine, but don't blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies of this crazy English muffin we call Winston's life.
I was the ninth guy off the bench for the eighth-best team in Latvia.
Winnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Ha-ha! Thanks for coming to watch me play, guys.
We didn't watch you play.
We watched you sit.
Which was still fun.
You know, any chance to get to Latvia, right, guys? Yeah, I haven't played all year.
They barely let me practice, but you know, like I always say, How about them Lats? So that's when you decided to change course.
That makes sense.
So my takeaway from that is Still building to the decision.
You are traded to Kraslava City.
The Outdoor League? Man, they play on a hillside! I give you surprise tip: Uphill basket, better.
Aha, and then you decided Ah! I'm going fast! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You never play basketball again.
Don't touch it.
Stop it.
And that's when I decided to stop playing the game of basketball.
Jess, walk away the moment you stop loving it.
I mean, that's what I did.
That's the thing, you didn't walk away.
You decided nothing.
That story contains zero decisions.
Look, I decided to stop playing the game of basketball when my doctor told me I had to stop.
Okay, okay, all right, I it was my decision Mm-hmm.
to start to play the game of basket You were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born.
Damn, do I even like basketball? I mean, goodness, have I ever made any decisions my whole life? Are we all just living inside the mind of a giant? All right, good job, buddy.
Really good.
Thanks.
You know, if I may be so bold Oh, Nick, please.
Winston, have a seat.
I was literally about to give advice.
She already heard one cautionary tale tonight, she does not need to hear another.
What she needs to hear is my story.
All right.
A story of hard choices.
A story of paths taken.
A story that I like to call, "Kablamo McYeah, Bro!" Ah, you stupid bast The title has nothing to do with the story, but you need a hook.
It all began back - Come on, Schmidt! What? Only one story in the whole wide world can begin in a hospital? I volunteered a lot in college.
But I shone brightest as a candy striper.
Sick people wanted me.
Dying people wanted to be me.
I was the total candy-striping package.
And yet I remained invisible to the one whose gaze I desired the most.
Invisible? You were like a 300-pound wall of peppermint bark.
Her badge said "RN" for registered nurse, but as far as I was concerned, it said "NILTH," "Nurse I'd Like To Hug.
" Not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form.
Where's a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that, huh? I don't volunteer.
I'm a man.
I have a job in marketing.
Obviously I was far too fat to work in marketing.
So I got a job any dumb slob could do.
Relax, man, it's your first day.
For a Jewish giant, I had a surprising knack for selling Christmas trees.
Not only did my wide center of gravity make me freakishly strong, but I could also sell like the wind.
Because I understood one fundamental truth.
When you're buying Christmas trees you're really buying sex.
Have you always been short? I've always been fat.
But who cares how God made you? Don't let him put you in a skin box.
At the end of the day, I'm just a fat guy standing here in front of a short guy telling him that I think we found his tree.
It wasn't long before I caught the attention of Old Man McCue, Christmas tree king of Syracuse, inventor of triple netting.
However In the words of the late, great Sir Billy Joel Billy Joel is definitely alive.
And he's definitely not a knight.
"The good, they do die young.
" As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long That even my mama thinks That my mind is gone, but When you're on your deathbed, when your life has been lived, you're never gonna say, "I wish I'd spent more time with my family.
" Because money and everything it buys, you can take it with you Interesting, money.
Actually the museum job pays more than the teaching job.
Wait, the m Then what the hell are we talking about here, you guys? Done deal, case closed.
Follow them ducats.
It's not always about the money, Schmidt.
Guys, look, it's almost 6:00.
And Candace is insanely punctual.
You know, one of the best career choices of the future Driveways.
You're welcome.
Jess, the museum job pays more.
All right - The decision has been made for you.
No, no, no.
You don't know the difference between more and less.
Don't you? - Yes, Schmidt.
All of my decision's have been made for me.
I'm only in sports radio because I played professional basketball.
I played professional basketball because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby.
What if somebody gave Baby Winston a flower? Then what would I be? - Beekeeper! - Hummingbird farmer.
Oh, does water sh**t out of the flower? If so, you'd be a hilarious comedian.
Wait, guys, this is classic after 6:00 topics.
Look, I There has to be more to this than money.
I really want to care about what I do.
Don't you ever miss getting your hands dirty - and selling? - I've moved up in the world.
I'm not freezing and covered in sap.
I'm making spreadsheets.
It's like Old Man McCue used to say.
The reward is in the destination.
It's not in the journey.
Was he wise or was he senile? Because he's mixed up a lot of really well-known sayings.
Jess, you're gonna want to listen to me.
Anyone else here named after their career? People call you Markety? Not yet.
That's too bad 'cause that's awesome.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hands up, Ulvis! Ball screen, Vlad, come on! There we go, yes! Bishop, finger out of your nose, now! Ernie's a really good coach.
Maybe we should call him Coach.
We should probably call him You do it first.
Yeah.
Uh Coach.
That's a great name! High five! Yeah! I think you see what I mean.
No, I do I really don't.
My point is don't overthink it, Jess.
The call's coming from inside the house.
What? Be who you are.
And do what you do.
What if I don't know who I am? And you know, I'm capable of doing a lot of different things.
Then you are on your own.
Good stuff, Coach.
Jess, would it help to think about your first day as a teacher? Like, I think about the first time I ever poured a drink - Boo, get off the stage! - Aw, man.
Nick! - Dude, stop.
No, that's interesting.
The first day I ever taught.
Portland Country Day.
Five-team Pacific Northwest squash champions.
Go, Rhododendrons! Now, if I was chalk, where would I be? If I were chalk, where would I be? Slip up like that in front of the kids, Day, and they'll eat you alive.
Eddie Pascucci kicked my ass because I'm new.
Well, guess what? I'm new, too.
I got lost trying to find the upper dining garden.
Oh, that's over by the hedge maze and the s*ab.
I haven't even met my horse yet.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
All of these jackets have cash in the pockets.
It's like a $50,000 lost and found.
Here, try this one.
Yup.
You look great, Clifton.
This doesn't fit! Eddie Pascucci beats up the unstylish! Yeah, that's right.
We had an ethnic, gay bully.
He's gonna have to come through me first.
Clifton Collins really just needed someone to believe in him.
So I started tong him in math, and he became the best math student in school.
So, let's look him up and see how happy and successful and amazing he's doing.
Yeah! - I think that'll really f*re you up.
All right, there's no trace of him.
What? - I'm really, I'm really good at this.
I'm good at it, let me see.
You found him.
He's right here.
No, I didn't.
Here's Clifton, wow.
It's not a - Yeah, he's right there.
That's Clifton.
Oh, yeah.
We're not the only ones looking for him.
So's the FBI.
What? - Yeah, he's a criminal.
No.
Oh, my God.
Clifton "Baby Madoff" Collins? Wanted for 53 counts of embezzlement.
Sounds like the math took.
Screw me.
Like, I Maybe I wasn't even reaching the kids at all.
Okay, you know what? - Miller up.
Excuse me? That's just like "fill 'er up," but with "Miller.
" - Don't.
'Cause I'm about to fill you up.
No, that's gross.
With my stories.
Oh, please don't.
That's disgusting.
What's disgusting about it? My first year of law school, I made an important discovery.
Look left.
Look right.
Next year, one of you will be gone.
What a clichÃ©, huh? Oh, you wrote that down.
You'll be gone.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be right here.
Take it easy, guy to my right.
I discovered that I hated being around these people.
But second year, I made another discovery.
I hated being around myself.
So my third year, I wanted to find a place where I belonged.
Where I could look to my left or look to my right and like what I saw.
Love you in that scarf.
Why don't you wear scarves anymore? That place? Perhaps you guessed it: This very bar.
Get out of town.
What a twist.
How long has that guy been there? Kevin-97? Since 1997, Jess.
Why else do you think we would call him I don't know.
Move it along, Miller.
True, I wasn't loving law school, but my grades were fine and I even signed up for the California State Bar.
And then, one day Red over-served himself and everything changed.
So you went behind the bar, quit law school, you became a bartender - There's more to it than that.
Two minutes! Oh, my God.
I honestly don't know what to do.
I have so little time.
Hey.
Cece! Have you ever questioned your entire career? Duh, I'm a 31 year old model.
My last job was for a phone sex ad, and I was the one calling.
Tell me what to do.
And don't tell me to ask the guys, because I already tried that.
And also, don't tell me to think about my first student, Clifton.
Okay, no, wait.
Your first student was not Clifton.
Lady, she's still got one minute.
That was a butt dial from your mother.
She is up to no good.
Cece, bring it fast, and bring it hard.
You have 53 seconds.
You okay? Yes.
No.
I think I need glasses unless crying makes your eyes not work.
I can't read this, but even when I can, I don't understand it.
Crying makes your eyes work better.
After I finished Sophie's Choice, I could see in the dark for a week.
Here's what I do when I lose mine.
Ooh, this is interesting.
Get in here, we'll learn it together.
But everyone'll laugh at us.
They can drive it or milk it as far as I'm concerned.
I don't know what that means.
I heard my dad say it.
My dad just d*ed.
Well, if you want to come over, and listen to mine say "They can drive it or milk it" you can.
He's also got one about the turds in City Hall.
Thanks.
I'm Cece.
Jess.
I was your first student.
Hey, Candace.
Um Yeah, actually I'm not gonna take the job.
Yeah, I'll see you Sunday.
Okay, bye.
Yeah! - Whoo! - Thanks guys.
Yes! - Thanks guys.
You did it.
Good stuff.
Hey, she did it.
You made the right call, Jess.
What's wrong? I think you're right.
I made the right decision.
Look, I know it's hard, but the hard is what makes it good.
Uhm, A League of Their Own - Is that from A League of Their Own.
Yes, of course.
All of my quotes are from a sports movie.
You guys don't know them, and so they seem original.
A League of Their Own is not a sports movie.
It's a sports movie, first and foremost.
It's about sisterhood and the w*r.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's about a baseball team grinding it up.
This used to be my playground Coming right up.
His sister really worries about his drinking, so what I do is I come in early, and I soak a teabag until the water turns brown and looks like booze.
I call it tea-water.
So tea.
I will take a big old glass of booze-water.
Got an antacid commercial tomorrow - Oof.
and I'm playing day-old curry.
Or you can bartend.
You can bartend till you're 90 years old.
Why don't you f*re this down to Kevin-97? Oh, no.
We're gonna work on that.
Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to Alge-Bio-Civics.
Turn in your equations, and you will get a frog.
Dissect carefully, because inside the frog is the name of the city council member who you will be e-mailing to restart construction.
Ms.
Day? - Yes.
I thought this was gonna be a disaster.
But thanks to you, I can go upstairs to the big boys and tell them they can always depend on Dr.
Alan Foster.
Yeah.
Please take his job, I'm begging you.
I'd do it myself, but I'd never pass the psych test.
So I figure if Foster can be a principal, then why can't I be a principal? - That's great.
I don't see why not.
Thank you.
Then you could take me to the principal's office and punish me - for being tardy, and - You know we're right here, right? Just lift up my britches and - We'll talk about it later.
Okay.
Very nice.
We'll do it in my office.
After I fill up my juice box.
So, guys, just quit my job today.
Whoa, big decision.
Oh, man! - What? I just finally said to myself, "It is time to make your own decisions.
" - Right on.
Yeah.
If it doesn't work out, I'm sure they'd be happy to have you back.
They would they would not like to have me back.
I b*rned a lot of bridges today.
Mmm.
Uh, stuff got weird.
Stuff got racial.
What? - I used a lot of swearwords.
Then I got sexual Well, sounds like you need a drink.
On the house.
What can I get you? - Ooh Let me get a, let me get a We have everything.
What would you like to drink? But you know, I'll make the decision.
Let me get - Double amaretto, extra cherries! - Double amaretto, extra cherries! That's what I was gonna say.
Nice.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness! My first shift, you know? I'm still working on it.
She's getting better.
That was great.
That was awesome.
Yeah.
A natural.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I didn't let you finish your story.
What's this? - The end of my story.
No way! You passed the bar exam? I wanted to prove to myself that I dropped out of law school because I wanted to be a bartender, not because I couldn't be a lawyer.
This also says "spaghetti sandwich.
" - That's just 'cause it's a great idea.
When I have a great idea, I write it down.
The point is is I want this.
You know, it makes me happy.
Well, here.
Now, can I get you a drink? - Sure.
Sure.
Cheers.
To unemployment.
Absolutely.
Exactly.
I see you're looking at a Douglas fir.
It's a beautiful tree.
We move a ton of these Dougie firs.
Love them.
But I feel like you're ready for the spruce lifestyle.
Let's spruce this up.
Let me put you in a spruce today.
What kind of ceilings you dealing with at home? Vaulted? Cathedral? By the way, there's no wrong answer.
You look like a confident man, you know that? You deserve a confident tree
Nick! We need to talk.
Winston stays.
End of discussion.
No, dude.
I got your Thanksgiving invitation.
(music playing, turkey gobbling) - Did you make this? - Absolutely not.
He's announcing Thanksgiving! With his little trumpet, he's announcing the feast! It's so funny (laughing) (turkey gobbling) We should name that little guy Roger.
When your testicles fell off, did you form lady parts, or is it kind of like a Gonzo nose down there? It's really interesting.
Yeah.
You see, the thing is, my testicles haven't fallen off Right.
it's just the morning.
And my testicles do this really unique thing of burrowing when it's cold out.
You're burning me.
I gotta be real with you.
Please.
I know how a guy can get, like, lost in a relationship.
I've been there, dude.
You're snuggling, you're snuggling, you're snuggling, and then, bam! Next thing you know, you're wearing a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on, because you guys said you were gonna dress up like each other for Halloween.
But she doesn't dress up like you.
But you still go to the party.
I could not be more sorry for you, but that's not my story.
Stand up.
Stand up? Yeah.
Okay.
Are those Jessica's pajama bottoms? It's, uh football player pants for, uh, br-breast cancer awareness.
I like the way that they hug my gronk.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
JESS: Camping on Thanksgiving? It might be a crazy Nick idea, but I kind of like it.
I thought you hated camping and nature.
You said you were afraid a fly was gonna fly in your head and learn all your thoughts.
I am a man, and men belong in wilderness.
It really means a lot to me.
The only thing I care about is that we're all together.
And that we can all sit down together and have a nice dinner.
I 100% agree.
I think everybody's gonna love this idea.
Me, too.
Camping? - Like we're animals? - What the hell? Come on.
Hear him out.
Let's face it.
Our indoor Thanksgivings haven't been so great.
Turkey! d*ad body! I think I'm into your mother.
So this can't be worse.
Thank you, Jessica, I got it from here.
All right.
This Thanksgiving, I want to honor the traditions of our forefathers.
The mighty Pilgrims and Native Americans who came together in order to survive.
Sure, yeah.
The first chapter in a proud history of cooperation.
It'll be the ultimate test of manhood and our survival skills.
It will? - WINSTON: How's this for a test of our manhood? We stay at home, we drink beer, we watch football.
Manhood.
I like that idea.
Winston, I'm talking about real men.
Me, too.
Men who fend for themselves.
You're the laziest man I know.
Okay, Jess, be honest with me.
Has he ever been on top? Real men are on the bottom.
No, they're not.
(laughing) - You're on the bottom - Guys, guys.
It's Thanksgiving.
We need to be together.
Who's in? Come on, guys! - All right, I'm in.
What? - Yeah, Schmidt! - Yes! Look, my parents were super divorced and they never took me camping, but I always thought that I'd be incredible at it.
Let's get ready.
WINSTON: What the hell is on your head, Schmidt? SCHMIDT: It's an exact replica of the hat.
Viggo Mortensen wore in Hidalgo.
Knew you'd like it.
(Jess chuckles) JESS: Wow! Nice job, Miller! This spot's beautiful.
NICK: I know.
Cece! - Cece's here? I didn't know she was gonna be here.
Yay, I'm so happy you came! (laughs) We're all together! - It makes me so excited.
Of course! I mean, what could be better than camping in the woods with my ex-boyfriend and his friend I just made out with.
With whom you just made out.
Don't.
It's very important.
You know I hate that.
Don't.
Grammar's important.
Seriously, don't.
If it get awkward, I'll come save you.
Happy Thanksgiving! JESS: Yay! (chuckles) Hey, what's up, girl? Hey, Cece.
(clears throat) Hey, I never, uh had a chance to ask you.
How did the, um How'd your guys' date go the other night? - Oh, with Cece? - Yeah.
Uh it was I loved it.
I mean, it was good.
It was cool.
That's great.
Super.
Super-duper.
So where you thinking - about pitching, uh, pitching a tent? - Thinking over there.
Oh, yonder? - Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Yonder.
Listen, I've been researching on the Internet for the past 12 hours everything there is to know about the wood.
Now I'm a I'm a master camper.
So if you need any help with anything, just come to me and ask, okay? (chuckling): Thanks, man.
I don't know anything about the wood.
I know everything.
I'm lost.
What is that, a tree? If these trees were skyscrapers, - you'd feel very comfortable.
Yeah.
I'd be right at home.
Unfortunately, - they're actual trees.
(chuckling): Yeah.
You're the best.
I love the hat! I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger? Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.
(quietly): Okay, hold on.
Do you do you hate camping, too? Are you kidding me? I absolutely hate camping.
Then why are we here? Because I didn't get a say.
I never get a say.
Whenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.
Guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.
Get out of here.
Winston! We could've made the craziest mugs, man.
(grunts) - Hey, Nick? - Yeah.
There's just beer in here.
That should last us for the first few hours, - actually.
Where's the food? Where-where are all the pies I made? Look, don't worry, Jess.
'Cause the food is right here.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand that gesture.
We're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner, just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.
But you brought beer.
You can't forage for beer.
And that's a necessity.
So this is Thanksgiving meal? We can do this.
Guys, we've gotten soft! With our antibiotics and our sports creams.
Do you think George Washington had a pet cat? Yeah.
No.
He didn't.
He hunted them.
What? And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.
That's terrible.
So you're saying George Washington milked his cat? Nothing is sounding accurate right now.
Not at all.
Where'd you read this? I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be hard.
But we will emerge out of this better friends and a tribe.
I'm on board.
(chuckles) Going old-school.
Men! k*lling! Hunting! Men! SCHMIDT, COACH and NICK: Men! Men! Men! Men! Oh, my cowman's my cowman my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.
WINSTON: Guys, look, I'm as much a man as anybody here, but this plan is straight-up dookie.
I need my sweets and I need my parade.
Yeah, you know what? I'm out, too.
Guys, guys, guys.
Look.
We're together.
We're a family.
It's Thanksgiving.
And I'm sure Nick has a plan.
Right? - Oh, yeah.
I've got a plan.
Great.
You got a plan? - The man's got a plan.
These wilderness guides right here detail what plants are safe for eating and what traps we can build.
Unfortunately, I ran out of money, so I couldn't print out the chapters on gutting and skinning, but we'll worry about that when we get there.
Pilgrim rules.
Men, hunters! Women, foragers.
I'm not hunting.
The only Hunt I want is Bonnie or Helen.
You know what I'm talking about, Coach.
What? Nick.
This is perfect.
Primal man in nature.
Stalking prey.
Who's basically the lady now, Coach? I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.
We're definitely moving in a small circle.
NICK: Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna clear a path this way.
We will travel northbound, I believe.
That's not north; that's south.
That is south? Then let's travel southbound.
I'm gonna clear a path.
If something's in there and you get injured, I promise you I will k*ll you fast.
(groans) Scat! Scat.
There's an animal nearby.
Hey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.
That's not a raisin.
This is scat.
Okay.
(coughs) (clears throat) That's poop for sure.
I was right.
In your face, Nick.
In your face, Nick.
How so? I don't know, he put a put a turd in his mouth.
And that's in my face? - Yeah.
I don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.
Let's wait on that.
You want to chase that with some dirt? Does anyone have any gum? No.
Not that I wanted any in the first place.
That's a mighty big hole there, Nick.
You trying to catch a refrigerator? It's a bear hole.
Bear falls in, other stuff falls in.
We take what the bear doesn't want.
Makes sense.
Classic human/bear team-up.
I'm from Chicago.
It's the best I can do.
Yeah, bears love to share.
What are you planning on doing with that bear when he falls into the hole? Dude, I'm trying the best that I can! We have no food.
Let me explain something to you, Nick.
When you're building a trap, you want to customize it to your prey.
So, I don't know, if was trying to catch, say a squirrel, I'd want think like a squirrel.
Allow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.
How do you get into the mindset of a squirrel? (clicking tongue) I'm a squirrel right? You do that really well.
Look at this! Oh, there's some nuts here.
Look at all these little nuts.
You might not want to do that.
If I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class, I'd ask you, but this is my territory.
(Schmidt yells) - My scapula! - Dude, are you all right? Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah! (Schmidt groaning) Get it! Get up.
Keep breathing, man.
I don't mean to be laughing, but are you okay? I'm gonna make you a sling.
You're gonna make me a what? You don't know how to do that.
A sling.
Of course I do.
What? - What are you doing? - I was an Eagle Scout.
What are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout? - Look.
That's actually really good.
I'm sorry, dude.
You wanted to be the best at camping.
You were so excited about your hat.
I didn't want to get in the way of that.
Plus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.
What are talking about? You're gonna let me be the best camper.
I am the best camper! Yeah.
I think this is chicory.
It says you can eat the root.
Or it's jasmine.
Which will k*ll you.
Hmm.
What do you guys think?
I'm sure it's fine.
Yeah, just eat it.
Hey, raspberries! There Ow! (laughs): Ow.
There are a lot of brambles in here.
There's a country store not far from here.
Ow! Three and a half stars.
The reviews say, "It's functional and dusty.
" - Ow! - Sounds good to me.
This is so fun.
Who wants to help? This plan is officially the worst.
We are starving.
Just admit, you don't want to do this, either.
Okay, listen up.
Only stuff we can find in the forest, right? Look at that fish.
It's perfect.
What? Oh, I'm gonna grab it.
I'm so hungry.
Now we get to eat, boys.
Dude, that looks d*ad.
Guys, stop being negative right now.
Laying on its side means it's d*ad.
I wouldn't get in that water, man.
You're gonna get beaver fever.
Where are my testicles now, Coach? When he catches that little critter, I'm gonna show you how to scale it.
Ow.
That hurts? Yeah, it hurts! A boulder fell on my Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite? Yes, it is! No regrets! (grunts) Aw! Aw, come on, Nick.
(yells) NICK: Yes! Quit it.
You guys might be right! It might be d*ad! In fact, it was d*ad! Smells fresh enough! Oh, come on, Winston, what? You just get your nails done? Get the apple dirty! Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.
God, I'm so hungry! Hey, hey! Hey.
Look what the men brought.
Oh, hey! Hey, hey! The plan worked.
Hey, he looks like a fighter.
He really was, kind of.
Oh, my God! - Wow.
I mean, well Whoa.
Like a smorgasbord.
You guys did great.
Yeah, we did.
Yep.
Where'd you get the cashews? - Um, on a bush.
Yeah.
How about the beets? - Also a bush.
That's right.
Yeah.
The avocado? - Also on a bush.
That's right.
Well, look at us.
Living off the land, fending for ourselves.
We got fish and fruits, and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple I've ever eaten in my life.
"Product of Oregon"? We walked to Oregon? - What? - What? That's why this cramp Yeah This place Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses? We're not.
I kind of knew from the beginning.
I mean, there's no way.
You just went to a store and got all this? I think so.
I think they definitely bought everything from the store.
The one thing I wanted was for us all to sit down together and have dinner, and you can't do that without dinner.
We have dinner.
That fish kind of looks like hippo meat.
Come on, man.
Let's just sit down and eat some delicious almonds.
And enjoy ourselves.
Yes.
And have a really nice Thanksgiving together.
Come on, Nick, let's eat.
Come on, man, let's eat.
I feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.
Betrayed.
What? Happy Thanksgiving.
Oh, come on.
Nick, come on! - Don't do this.
FYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.
WINSTON: Come on, Nick! These avocados were expensive! Here we go.
It smells so good.
I can't wait till it's ready.
I'm gonna be so stuffed.
Ooh! The eyeball fell off.
That's how you know it's good.
They got to pop out when it's ready, I think.
Now that the cards are finally on the table, I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.
The answer's me.
First one to make a flame wins.
Let's do this.
Now, check this out.
This is how you make a flame.
You go with two rocks.
One against the other.
You create friction.
I'm done.
What? I'm done.
Well, that's barely a flame, it's going out.
Whoa! Well, goodness gracious! What are you? A sorcerer? Damn it! Hey, mountain man.
You want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us? I should've known those beets weren't from nature.
Nothing purple grows in nature.
Look, we didn't come through, okay? You came through! Look, you caught a fish! That's really, really impressive.
How'd you do it? With my bare hands.
No way! You're so strong.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was It fought What are you doing? I'm not doing anything.
I think that's amazing.
You provided for us.
You're a man.
Don't patronize me, Jess.
I'm not.
Ever since we started dating, Jess, we've been doing a bunch of girly stuff, and I like some of it and you, but my tolerance to alcohol has, like, gotten really, scary low.
I drank three beers, and I got, like, all giggly and tired.
And I didn't want a fourth.
Last night, I had a dream that I was brushing a horse.
I just feel like I'm losing myself a little.
Just let me eat this disgusting fish and - No, Nick, Nick.
Yeah, just let me be over here.
This is the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.
Don't touch I wouldn't touch it.
It is! It is.
Jess, don't Don't put your hands in Oh, my Lo Spit it out.
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Fragrant.
Mmm, I can really I can really taste the lake.
Spit it out.
I feel like I'm there in the lake with the fish.
Mmm! Bony.
That's gonna hurt going down.
But I like it.
Hurts so good! Hurts so good! Jess, that fish was d*ad when I caught it.
There was a sock near it.
(suppressed gagging) I'm gonna come with you.
No.
Jess, let me come with you.
Where are you going? There's something over here.
I'm gonna look at it.
Jess I'm seeing some interesting things.
I'm out of the office till Friday.
For immediate assistance, please call Deb at extension A.
C.
Slater.
(grunts) You guys see where she went? - No.
No.
Jess? - Jess? - Jess? Jess! - Jess? - Jess? NICK: Jess? Jess! I just want to see more carpet samples before I make a final decision.
(gags) Jess! CECE: Jess? NICK: Jess! Jess, where are you? Jess! Jessica! NICK: Oh, God, this is all my fault.
And you know what, Coach? I did like the invitation.
I made it.
And I liked the little trumpet guy.
I thought he was cute.
He was cute as a damn button! - What? So many st Hey, guys, look.
There she is! There are dogs that have dollar signs but don't even own banks.
Jess, we're over here! - Jess! Wait, wait, wait.
I've seen that tree before.
Jess, stop! The bear trap! (gasps) - No! - I'm coming! Jess! Headfirst? Why? (Nick groans) (groans) Son of a (gasps) Oh, my God, Jess, I am so sorry.
I was an idiot.
This Thanksgiving plan was so stupid.
You shouldn't have eaten that fish.
I'm sorry.
Don't let them pay the bill, okay? You bring the check to me.
No arguments, moon man.
CECE: Oh, my God! Is anyone hurt? We're fine.
I may have cracked a few ribs, and, uh, Jess is delirious.
I think she thinks she's a rabbit.
Guys, we're gonna figure something out, all right? NICK: Just get us a rope or a stick or something.
All right, man, so, any ideas? What are you talk? You know what, Coach? Don't humor me.
What? - You know what to do.
Look, I admit it.
You're a better camper than I am.
You're better at life than I am.
You're probably better at dating Cece than I am.
I saw you guys the other night inhaling each other in front of the loft.
Schmidt, that's all we did.
That was it.
I asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay? And now she won't return any of my text messages.
She's been ignoring me this whole trip.
I'm all, like, "Hey.
" She's like, "Mm-hmm.
" I'm like, "What?" Why are you smiling, dude? I'm not smiling.
I'm over here baring my soul to you, dude, and you're freaking smiling in my face.
Yeah.
This is the face I make when I listen.
All your teeth show when you listen? I'm not.
You're smiling right now.
I opened up to you.
You're pissing me off.
Stop smiling.
I'm not.
I will wreck you.
You're crazy, man.
You're nuts.
Stop it, listen to me.
We are going to solve this right now.
All right, take your pants off.
Okay, I am no Eagle Scout, but I know how to make a pants rope.
Pants rope.
You're a genius.
I know.
Okay.
Are you gonna take off your pants? Yeah, right after I take off my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.
That's gonna happen for real? - Just take them off now.
(laughing): Whoa, look at Winston's pants.
It's got kittens on it.
These aren't kittens.
I cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.
So stupid.
Take them off.
They're coming off.
CECE: Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.
Okay, you go first, Jess.
I'll be right behind you to support you.
Ding, dong, ding, dong! - What are you doing? Okay, how about this? Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.
Back at you.
Whoa.
(coughs) You can do it! There, hold this flashlight, buddy.
Grab hold.
(bl*ws raspberry) - Come on, Nick! Come on.
Here we go! Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.
(straining) Use your legs, Nick.
(grunting) Come on, Nick! Come on.
Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings.
Come on.
Almost there.
Let's go.
You got it, you got it.
You got it, you (straining) (all exclaim) (sighs) You chubby son of a bitch.
Yeah.
(groans) You okay, Jess, you all right? Yeah! - Yeah.
Yeah.
ALL: Oh! Hey.
Thanks for saving me, mountain man.
So I've got good news from the doctor: you don't have rabies.
Oh.
You have, uh, giardia and something called Legionnaires' disease.
I'm just glad they were able to save your foot.
What? No, nothing.
Never mind.
(chuckles) Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Ah, I was really stupid.
I haven't been myself.
You're the man I want.
All you wanted was for everyone to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.
Next year.
Potato chips.
Chips? Maybe a treat.
Listen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought maybe that I could give you some advice about about Cece.
How desperate do you think I am? I think you're probably very desperate.
I'm very desperate, I mean, she's giving me nothing.
Told her she looked pretty, she said thanks.
Mm-hmm.
What kind of mind game is that? Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.
Cece is not going to be one of those things.
I once spent hours in a car with just a cracked window for air.
She was going into a club and she just kind of left me there.
Why are you smiling about that? Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.
I got a plan.
SCHMIDT: Enough with the plans.
You suck at plans! Not another Nick Miller plan.
I love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.
Hey.
It's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.
What? Got us some Brazilian nuts, a couple of string cheeses, and.
Snack.
Thank you.
WINSTON: I got the parade on my phone.
Yes.
Made some decorations.
I think this may be a turkey sandwich, but I'm not sure, and I know this whole thing isn't It's perfect.
Look, guys, start without me because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.
(all laughing) You were throwing up a lot.
(laughs) That was scary seriously.
Okay, I'm starving actually.
Let's eat.
Yeah, let's eat.
Nick found all this food in the woods.
(all laughing) Can I have the ginger ale? Yeah, Nick found that.
It's already open.
Oh, hey.
I was wondering about date night tonight.
Do you wanna just stay in? 'Cause you know what that means.
Romantic dinner and "Homeland"? - Sex on the couch.
Or your thing.
Actually, "Homeland" sounds great.
Or your thing.
Hey, Nick, um Last night when Ferguson and I were in the shower, I had an epiphany.
It's time to get back in the game.
You know, meet some women.
Human women.
Human? Is there any other kind? Anyway, I was wondering if you'd watch Ferguson tonight while I go out for some drinks with some work buddies.
Just for a little while.
You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.
We're having date night tonight.
Jess Winston wants to go out to meet human women.
Without the cat.
Oh, yep, yep.
Yep, yep.
Nick will watch the cat.
Question Are those mouth pills or butt pills? Just one pill.
Just one butt pill.
Here you are.
I'm not touching that thing.
No? Okay.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
You got it.
Hey, guys.
Just hanging at home tonight? No, actually, we have a date tonight.
'Cause I just made some cobbler.
Some peach cobbler and slow-churned vanilla bean ice cream, and Coach is asking Cece out on a date tonight, and Does anybody want a bite of this, 'cause it's? Ho! Ho! It's fresh out of the oven.
It's piping hot! Ha! Ha! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Well, I hope Coach at least ran this by you first.
Coach came over, he followed the bro code.
Actually went really well.
Yeah.
Just the man I wanted to see.
You found me.
Yeah, I did.
I got a question for you, playa.
Drop the b*mb, man! Can I ask Cece out on a date? Yeah! Wait, what? Wait, that's so great for Cece.
Coach is super hot.
Wrong crowd.
I see that now.
Be that as it may, you blew it with Cece, so you have to be fine with this.
I am.
You are? - I promise I am.
You are? - 100% fine.
You're fine? - Yeah, I'm absolutely fine.
Really? It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach, it's good for America.
Who knows? We might even get another Tiger Woods out of this situation.
Wouldn't that be nice? I'm probably getting ahead of myself.
Who knows if Cece will even say yes? She said yes! We're going to the Staples Center to watch a game tonight.
Are you still Are you cool with this? Hmm? I mean, 'cause all you have to do is say the word, man, and I'll back off, for real.
N No, man.
Come on.
Date that thing.
Yeah! And then date it again.
All right.
It's not gonna date itself.
Yeah, date it all night long.
I'm kind of nervous! Yeah, I'm nervous.
Yeah, I'm really nervous.
Um I mean, she's beautiful and she's super cool.
And it's just, like Like, you don't even know.
I 100% know.
Yes, you kno You know.
She stopped the wedding because of me, so I'm just saying.
And then I ruined it 'cause I had my own thing.
Malia broke up with me and that kind of, like, threw my head for a loop, so I'm super vulnerable right now.
It's like I don't know.
Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.
Come on.
You're Coach.
You're the Coach.
Yeah.
You're the prize.
Remember, you're the prize.
You're the prize.
I'm Coach! Yeah, you're Coach.
She doesn't stand a chance! - Oh, yeah, well She's gonna get it good! Yeah! Or you could take it slow! - Nah, I'm g*n it! - Oh, oh! Y-you're gonna g*n it.
I am g*n it.
Yes.
You're gonna g*n it for real? That first-class ass is sitting in coach tonight.
And best believe, my seat will be in an upright and locked position.
Thanks, Schmidt.
Oh boy.
He's gonna g*n it.
I don't know if you heard that, but he said he's going to g*n it.
He's really not fine.
When he says, "I'm fine," he's about to get un-fine.
Aw, Schmidters.
There's gonna be other open mics.
With sturdier stools.
I'm fine.
I know you're fine.
Then they'll see your rap skills.
Then Hey.
Stop! You just said you were fine! You just said you were fine! Let me die! I know Schmidt.
He's gonna try and stop that date from happening.
Okay.
So the strategy is containment.
Okay.
We got to lock him up.
Distract him like a baby.
If he gets out of line, we got to get physical.
We're gonna get physical with a baby? Please don't question me.
I'm a pro.
Or we could help him move on.
Take him out, get him drunk, maybe meet someone new? No.
We just got to keep him in a safe place.
I wish I had that dog cage.
What? When you see a dog cage for sale, you buy it.
Hey, Jess, about tonight, I'm so sorry.
We'll have date night when we're marrie - Da, burp a durp a durp.
What did you just Merry.
When we're very Merry Christmas.
All right, moving on.
Hey, uh I'm having second thoughts about Coach and Cece.
Maybe I should stop their date.
Smarten up! Thank you.
Um Did you get a chance to get that, uh the dog cage? - No.
I feel bad.
You didn't? - That was the solution.
I know it was.
Yeah, Jess, so I j I just I just buzzed him up.
I He asked me out on a date, and I said yes.
We're both going through a breakup right now, - which is good, right? - Totally.
g*n it.
g*n it! - He's here.
Don't go past second base.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Wow.
Uh, y-you look amazing.
Aw.
You look this.
I give you this 'cause you look this, this and this.
I'll give you all these.
No.
Thank I'm really excited about the game.
Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get my purse.
Okay, cool.
What is wrong with you? You're the prize! You're the prize! Get it together.
Hey.
What's up, man? - Hey.
That's what's up, that's what's up, that's what's up.
Really appreciate this, guys.
Are you guys hungry? - Always.
Yeah.
Great.
I'm gonna go get some food from the Staples Center.
Hey, easy.
Chill out.
Okay.
All right.
You're right, you're right.
Great call.
Hey, Winston.
Hey.
What happened to you? I thought you were supposed to go to a party.
Yeah, it's been so long that I think I forgot how to talk to women.
You ever wonder if someone in here has k*lled someone? Ferguson is his name.
Yeah, he's my cat.
Here's him in a cowboy hat.
Good lord, darling, how big are your feet? You know what? It's fine.
I'll be alone my whole life.
You know, Hank Aaron was alone for every home run he h*t.
As long as I got Ferguson.
Speaking of which, where is that cat? Ferguson! That's strange.
He usually comes when I call him.
Nick, you left the window open? Oh, my God, no.
Nick! - What? You know he always trying to kick it with those pigeons.
Nick, you let him out.
I did I didn't mean to.
I just opened the window.
Man, I asked you to do one thing! - Winston, I'm really sorry.
This is your fault, man! - I feel terrible, Winston.
You're gonna help me find him! Winston, don't leave Winston Okay, I'm coming, buddy.
Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to stay here and keep an eye on Schmidt.
No! No, no, no.
You can't leave me here with him.
No, she's right.
You can't do that.
What if it gets rough? Nick, he is in pain.
I can feel it.
Don't you go! - Stay! I am so scared, man! What do you want me to do, Jess? - Stay.
Everybody settle! Look, this is my fault.
Winston, I'm coming with you.
Schmidt, just get it together.
Jess, I'm sorry.
Just keep him here and keep his mind off the date.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
We got to go.
Let's find that damn cat! What do you think Coach and Cece are doing right now? - I don't know.
They probably just sat down.
Touching thighs for the first time.
I'm gonna go stop that date! - No! Is that literally all you have? Oh, my God, we're screwed.
Nick! - Nick! Uh, think.
Coach gave me an out.
He said, "Just say the word and it's off.
" And you know what? I'm just gonna say the word.
No! No! You call, you say the word.
No, Schmidt! God, you can't do that to Cece.
She's just starting to move on.
All we have to do is get through the night.
Just have to get your mind off her.
What do you want to start with? Play it now Play it now, my baby Cracklin' Rosie, get on by What's-what's happening? Maybe just go no shoes.
I don't know.
Okay, and this one's tenth grade, so This one's from Evan G.
Evan G.
was the captain of the water polo team.
"Hey, Jess, we both like lunch.
" That's true.
Oh, lean in Aw, dude Play it now, play it now My baby Cracklin' Rosie, get on board Camryn Manheim represents a woman who was heckled by a carnival clown, and Dylan McDermott says - I can't stop thinking about Cece! - Okay! Nick said this would work.
Sit down.
Stop thinking about Cece.
Wow.
Look at this leather.
It's so smooth, brown.
It's just like Cece.
That's weird.
You're right.
I'm just gonna lay down for a little bit.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, this feels good.
Okay.
What are you doing, Schmidt? - Nothing, just go.
No, no, no, no.
Just go away.
Okay Schmidt, hey.
No! We're getting you out of here, and we're gonna get you a new woman, okay? Nick said to stay home.
Well, Nick doesn't know everything, Schmidt.
And please stop this.
This is so disgusting.
I can't even look at you.
Come on, this is gross.
This is getting really weird.
Please! Just one more kiss! No, you're kissing a sectional, you dummy! All right.
That was the right move.
You did good.
Ferguson! - Ferguson! Ferguson! Come here, buddy! Come on, you little son of a bitch! We should do another lap around the park.
I bet those mean-ass kids playing frisbee are gone by now.
Winston We've looked everywhere.
What are you do? Winston.
Damn it! I should've never gone to that party.
Nah, the party was a good thing.
You should go to more parties.
Really? I got sh*t down by, I don't know, And then I come home to find out that you have misplaced my best friend.
Ferguson's your best friend now? - Yes! Would you listen to yourself? This is pathetic.
Whoa.
"Pathetic" is harsh.
I didn't mean - Friends don't call friends pathetic.
Well, what do friends do when their other friend is taking a shower with a cat? Wait, wait, wait! I just got a text.
Somebody found him.
No way! Ferguson? - Yes.
Yes! Don't do that at all.
If that cat's alive, we're made up.
How you liking that merch? Oh, it's It's great, thanks.
Yeah, yeah.
You want a pretzel? - No, I'm-I'm fine, thanks.
It wasn't a question.
Hey, yo, slice! Let me get about seven of them hot things! You worried about the money? It's cool, I got it, babe.
Coach had a good year today.
Yeah, when I-I agreed to go out with you, this isn't exactly what I expected.
I know, I hear that a lot, I hear that a lot.
Uh-oh! Ha-ha! Look at that.
Coach is bl*wing up.
Oh.
I'll just Thanks.
Damn it.
I can't mingle with this trash.
I've been to the mountaintop.
Okay, look.
Look at me.
You are moving on.
Now, where's the old Schmidt? When I moved into the loft, you used to pull so many ladies.
You were legendary.
That year, uh, Hurricane Schmidt did-did demolish - a number of beach communities.
Right.
All right, we're gonna go talk to this girl over here.
She's on a flip phone, Jess.
I mean, she's either poor or a time traveler.
Hi! This is my friend Schmidt.
And he's sweet and he's smart.
And he has a job that I don't really understand, but seems to pay him well.
Schmidt, sit down.
Okay.
I'm gonna give you two a moment.
Look, you're a beautiful woman.
In another life, we certainly would've been lovers, but my soul mate is at a Sparks game right now with another man.
I need to go get her.
Oh, you poor thing - Please don't interrupt me.
Now, do you see that bug-eyed woman over there? I need to ditch her so that I can go fulfill my destiny.
Now, tell me when she looks away.
Not now.
Not now.
Wait.
Now.
What might've been.
Hey, Schmidt! No! What do you think he's gonna look like when we get him back? Found him under the steps eating a d*ad raccoon's eyeball.
Your cat's a psycho.
Oh, did my baby have a tasty treat? Ferguson, I missed you so much, little buddy.
They're very connected, those two.
I can relate.
Got a beast of my own.
Hodgkiss, wake up.
We got company.
Aw.
Is that a squirrel? - Squirrel? It's a hamster.
Nick, you know what a squirrel looks like.
Okay, you've been outside, man.
Trying to just figure out the smell, I guess.
This guy's the best.
I'd rather stay home and watch Grey's with him than go out to some bar, try to impress some douche bag dressed like a lumberjack.
I am done chasing men.
I hear that.
I am so done chasing women.
That's too bad.
Yeah, it's too bad.
You guys hungry? - Oh, no, but thank you very much - I could eat.
Winston, do you like bologna? It's the kind you have to peel the wrapper off just to get to the meat.
And do you have pudding in a cup? I never have pudding in a cup.
No.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing that she doesn't? That's a good thing.
You know, I don't know what's going on here.
Find Staples Center! Finding Starples Medical Supply.
No, you dumb pocket robot! Dan plummer rubber stumpers.
Aah! Now you're just making up words! That's not even a place! Damn you! Maiden worcestershire sauce.
Huh.
Chocolate.
Hi, there.
I'm ruining a date, and I don't want to show up empty-handed.
I will take three of the, ooh, the dulce de leches.
Um How about some caramels? Do you have anything that says "I'm sorry for cheating on you.
Please don't sleep with my friend"? Of course you don't.
Wonderful.
Ooh, look at that Samples.
Wha? Who are you texting right now? Uh, wh-what are you talking about? I'm not texting.
I was just, uh You're texting right now.
Nah, I'm just, uh Okay, you know what? Whoever you are texting, if you want to be with them, you should just go off and be with them.
You're so jealous.
Okay, yeah, you know what That's it! That is the last straw! I'm out of here.
Cece So, Bertie, have you always been a bus driver? I used to manage a shoe store.
Then I, uh, quit, had a few dark years.
Sold christian t-shirts for a while.
Okay.
Got my tubes tied.
Not cheap.
This is a real honest conversation.
Shut up, Nick.
Pulled myself out of that personal hell, and voilÃ .
Wow.
You know, I like driving bus.
Get to put whatever I want on the dash.
Keeps the darkness away.
You know? I also, uh I paint.
You paint? It's a boat.
Oh, I can see it's a boat.
All right, well, uh I better take my stomach medicine.
I got to get up at 3:30.
Is that A.
M.
? - I drive a bus.
Will you eat your damn sandwich, Nick.
I don't like it.
What about you, Winston? Do you like it? I'm not gonna lie to you, Bertie.
Sometimes it was a little hard to chew.
Well You can suck on it to make it soft.
Wow.
Is something happening between you two? - Dude, she is so real.
Okay, good.
Would you do me a favor? Now, you owe me.
Winston, I would love to.
Anything.
I mean it.
Anything.
Okay.
I owe you.
I need you to take Ferguson home tonight for me while I just stay here and, you know, see where this goes.
Yes.
This is a big moment.
Yeah.
I'm proud of you.
Listen, Ferguson, I'm about to do what adults do.
Hey, wish me luck.
I think that's enough.
Wish me luck.
Oh, this is a fat cat.
It's a tough decision.
Do I? I'll just leave - Stay here, stay here.
Okay.
Yeah! Cece, wait! Please wait! I was texting my mom! - Dork.
Shut up! Oh, come on! Do you really expect me to believe that? No.
I-I promise I My mom She was texting me because I was super nervous about this date.
Your mom? - Look.
"Go get 'em, BooBoo"? That's me.
I'm BooBoo.
Why do you need inspirational quotes from your mom just to talk to me? I'm sorry.
I I'm just I'm coming out of this relationship, and, like I just I don't know.
I feel I don't know how to I don't know how to do this anymore.
I know how you feel.
You do? Yeah.
Wow.
Uh I just want to put on some Drake and get up on you, girl.
You see, you're doing it again.
Damn it! I know.
Sorry.
Hey! Schmidt! Schmidt, what are you doing?! Why do you have all that chocolate? I'm going to go win her back! Do you know where I can get a pretty candle?! No.
Come on, Schmidt, get in the car.
Get in the car.
I love her, Jess.
I have to tell her.
Well, you can't.
You have to let her go.
I know.
Look, you're right.
I know.
Okay, good.
Come on, get back in the car.
I also know that in about 30 seconds, I'm gonna run away from you again, and this time, I will lose you.
I'll go down alleys, I'll cut across parks.
I will live in the shadows, just slithering, lurking, trolling the darkness.
Jess, there's only one way for you to stop me.
Well, I'll do it, whatever it is.
h*t me with your car.
What?! No! No! It's the only way for you to stop me! No! That's crazy, Schmidt! Come on, Jess.
Now, do it! I deserve it.
I cheated on your best friend, I tried to break up you and Nick.
h*t the gas.
No! No! Jess, you do this, or I'm gonna run.
I don't want to! - I'm gonna give you to the count of three.
No, I don't want to! Schmidt! - Three.
Two.
Do it for Cece.
Oh, my God! What the hell was that?! You told me to h*t you with the car! - You friggin' h*t me with your vehicle! - You asked me to.
I didn't think you were gonna do it.
I barely tapped you.
This is my favorite utility khaki! Well, then don't tell me to h*t you with my car if you don't want me to h*t you with my car! - You're out of control! - What? Ma'am, please pull over.
Jess! Oh, my God! Schmidt! Son of a bitch! - I know how this looks.
Like you h*t a man with your car? Twice.
I only meant to h*t you once.
Well, you h*t me twice.
Also, he asked me to h*t him.
I'm in a really weird place.
I just need to write a report.
She's not a criminal.
She She was being a friend.
I h*t him because I care about him.
You guys are into some weird stuff.
Well, congratulations.
You made it.
I did, didn't I? Yeah.
And, hey, you know, don't worry about the hospital bill.
I'll pay it.
Wait a minute.
Did you think that I was gonna pay? Well, you h*t me with your car, and I thought You told me to h*t you with the car.
Schmidt, don't pretend you're fine.
I know you're not.
I'm not fine.
But I will be.
Uh Let's just wait it out.
Okay.
God, it's been a half an hour.
Come up for air, you weirdoes.
Mm, mm, mm.
I'm getting kind of revved up.
Nick has some work to do.
Oh, God.
Give me a chocolate.
Mm.
Hey, there.
Hey.
Can I get some of that? Mm-hmm.
You spending the night, or what? Oh, hell, yeah.
Ah, Hop Foo's, my favorite.
Don't mind if I brunch.
Are you eating takeout for breakfast? - Hey, you're my girlfriend now.
You're not supposed to judge anything I do.
Say that again.
You're my girlfriend now.
(both laugh) I like it.
Even when you have dumpling in your mouth.
Sounds good.
I have to go.
I have a big meeting with Principal Foster today.
I hate that guy.
He always says no to your ideas.
No, no, no.
Not this one.
This one is, uh, Ocean Conservation Day.
Why do you do this to yourself, Jess? So you're telling me to not even try? I just don't want you to be disappointed when he says no.
Look, maybe you should try to try a little less.
How am I supposed to try to not try? - That's a catch-22.
Oh, hey, Coach.
Oh, I dropped a dumpling! - That his breakfast? - Yeah.
Isn't it cute? - He's not even ashamed of it.
Oh I got it! It almost got away from me Aah! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
Look, Principal Foster, we have the chance to do something really great.
Everything's been donated.
All we need are transportation costs.
(stammers) Come on! That's only the most expensive part of doing anything! You I'm sorry.
That was rude.
I slept very badly last night.
Had a chai tea very late.
Had friends in from Montreal.
Some of these kids have lived in L.
A.
their entire lives and they've never even seen the ocean.
Last week I asked them to draw what they thought the ocean looked like.
I got a lot of stuff like this.
Is that a bagel with wings? - Yes, sir, it is.
Extraordinary.
I'm afraid I'm not taking no for an answer.
You're gonna have to take no for an answer because that's just the way it is.
Hmm, a shark with legs.
That's not even anatomically close to correct.
That's just a square, though.
Have them start over.
That's just terrible.
Nick? I want to talk to you about your fitness level.
Of what? My body? - When's the last time you worked out? You know what? I'll tell you when the last time he worked out was.
It was the time that he battled his daddy's other dumb sperm in order to make his way to his mama's dumb-ass egg.
Your burns are getting better, man.
Just really long.
Okay.
Look, I don't need to work out.
I'm old-fashioned, Coney Island fat-strong.
Ah, Nicholas.
Chinese food for breakfast.
See you're still a health nut.
Aren't you supposed to be at work? - I'm rocking a PD personal day.
Yeah, last day of the move.
Coach, I see you've wasted no time moving into my old room.
Anyway, I just came over to, uh, drop off my old key.
Wow, so this is like a moment.
Looking to get some much-needed space from this place.
You're right across the hall.
That's true.
Everywhere you go There you are.
What? - COACH: What? - His jeans are so small.
NICK: He looks like a little puppet.
Like something some Italian whittled.
Come on, man, just let me train you.
You know what, Nick? You should do it.
I would love for Coach to train me, but I kind of pushed it too hard at the court yesterday.
Went in for a dunk.
Landed sort of funny.
(yells) Typical Winston.
(laughing) - That's true.
What is that supposed to mean? Because you're always too injured to play.
Remember when you sat out of the game because you were sad? I was also cold.
Nick.
Let's do this.
Look at me.
Now, you're in a new relationship, which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15.
That's not a thing.
It is a thing.
Jess is into this.
I've seen this happen a million times.
The boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20.
Next thing you know, you're a fat dude on a little bike with a cowboy hat on talking about, "My ass hurts.
" - I don't want to be that.
I don't want you to be that.
I would just be riding around in circles or would I be going places? Circles, dude.
Fat-guy rash on your arm.
Okay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me to work out for years.
It didn't take.
Also, and it's not an excuse, I have a very bad back.
Your bad back? - Yeah.
You gave me a piggyback ride two days ago and you giggled the whole time.
It was awesome.
It was also really funny.
That was pretty funny.
We took the stairs, dude.
Yeah.
It's 'cause I was excited.
Nick.
Either take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy, or you train with me, and be a do-ing guy.
It's hard because I've been a dumpling guy my whole life I know.
One day, that's all I need.
And I will change your life.
You'll be able to see your abs.
I thought God just didn't give me those.
Come on.
Let's do it.
My man! - I'm in! I'm gonna warn you.
Working out is not my thing.
Not worried, man.
I do not fail.
You know what? I'm in, too.
You're injured, you shouldn't, you shouldn't do it.
What? Come on, Winnie the Bish play through the pain, baby.
You know what? Let's warm up with some jumping jacks.
(yells) (smacks lips) (groans) I was going Oh! Miss Day! Check out my cool beach hat.
Unfortunately, um, I have some bad news.
Uh, we're not gonna get to go on that field trip.
But you said anything is possible, Miss Day.
You just keep wearing that hat, Crystal.
Because as long as hot dogs are hats Anything is possible.
You could be the first little girl in space.
You just ride that hot dog hat all the way to the moon, girl.
Oh, Crystal, you're not legally allowed to touch me.
But thank you.
(groans) Hey, guess who got a trainer.
So many menus.
I'm gonna look like Barry Bonds.
Seriously, what the hell? - Hey.
(groans) I take it, it didn't go well with Foster.
It did not go well.
Aw, Jess.
I hate seeing you hurt like this.
Are you serious? More menus? This is like Why do we need more menus? - Don't we have enough menus? - Feels like you're saying menus a lot.
This is an eco-disaster.
Conservation deserves a win today.
Hop Foo's has k*lled its last tree.
Jess, this feels like a something-else-is-going-on type of thing.
Are you okay to drive? You got crazy eye! Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's.
Can I help you? This morning, there were nine menus just in my apartment.
I also hate those menus, they're so bad for the environment.
It's wasteful.
It's an eco-disaster.
I'll talk to my boss, see if we can change that.
Yeah, great, you do that.
I'm gonna follow up with you on that.
I compost, recycle, but it's I don't feel like it's enough.
Thank you.
Geez, thank you so much for stepping up and saying something.
That's who I am, that's just, you know, I'm - My name's Brian.
Jess.
Jessica.
Jess.
It's really refreshing to meet someone who actually cares.
Well, it helps that you're gorgeous.
Ha! Blah! (laughs) Burr! No, that's crazy.
That ain't real.
That's dumb.
That's straight dumb.
You're dumb.
You're nice.
You excited for the holidays? I am.
Hmm.
Anyway - My system is built to be easy.
Okay.
It's easy as peanuts.
Easy as peanuts? - Yeah.
That's not an expression; no one says that.
PEANUTS is an acronym.
PEANUTS stands for: Physical Education Activity Nuts! Like, like go nuts, have fun! Yeah, but you got to use every letter.
I'm aware of that, but it still works.
Yo.
Yo.
Hey.
What's going on, guys? (chuckles) Let's do this.
I tell you, ain't no injury gonna hold Old Winnie the Bish down, 'cause I'm a warrior.
Nick knows.
Burpies? All right, cool.
(groans) - Injury is gonna get worse.
I'm not a quitter! (phone rings) Hey, Schmidt, what's going on, man? Everything okay? Did I leave my Oakland Raiders yarmulke over there? Don't know.
Coach and I are working out.
I've been trying to get you to work out for years.
Well, just come over, man.
I'm enjoying my space.
But maybe you should just put me on speaker.
Okay, you're on.
Okay, cool, set the scene.
What's the vibe over there? - Nick's in jeans.
Nixon jeans? What the hell are Nixon jeans? They sound really cool.
(sighs) Hey, I solved the menu thing.
I just went down there, I took action.
Boom-yah.
I made a change.
Now that I can do that, I really feel like I can figure out this field trip thing.
Double boom-yah.
(both chuckle) There are still some things we need to figure out.
Just got to get the message across.
Hey, hey, you don't, you don't need to leave these anymore.
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you running to? Who sent you?
Brian, I thought you were gonna talk to your boss.
I am the boss.
Hop Foo's is your restaurant?
Sorry I lied.
You just seemed kind of crazy, so I didn't want to deal.
But you care about conservation.
Oh, I don't, I really don't.
I care about my restaurant.
You're going down, Brian! I'm gonna collect signatures, I'm gonna start a petition, and I will turn it in to the person who's in charge of restaurants.
And I'm gonna report you to the City! Oh, no, not the City.
No! You're a jerk, Brian! I'm gonna burn down your building! I won't do that, I won't do that.
Why do people suck?! Ow! COACH: Okay, we're gonna warm up with music.
(electronic music playing) - Yeah, feeling that? - I guess so.
Yeah, got to loosen up the shoulders.
Wiggle those arms.
(gibbering) - Arms, not your face.
Oh, sorry, thought you said "face.
" Right.
Sexy.
Working out is sexy.
Yeah, it is.
That's not sexy, man.
This is sexy.
That isn't sexy.
Ooh, ay.
Damn it! It's a great workout track! What's next? And time.
Yes! - Yes! - Whoo! - Whoo! Let's do it again.
Again? - Yeah, man.
(grunting): Six, seven, eight.
Come on, man! Mine's broken.
Push through it, man, you got it.
Ah, thank God you're here, Cece.
What's the emergency? Why does Jess need all this Chinese food? No, no, no, I just made all that up.
Wait, you tricked me into getting you food? Yes.
Why? - Nick, what is this? - For after don't worry about it.
I will be right back.
(sighs) Hello zere.
I'm, I'm Cece, I-I remember you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great memory.
That's what's up, that's what's up.
No doubt.
Diggity.
(sighs) (chuckles) - Nick! - Breasts Ni This is for the food, and there's a little extra for you.
Oh, my God, are you tipping me? - Yeah.
Well, if I'm gonna get in trouble, give it back.
I gave you four bucks.
I'll tip you good I'll tip you right over.
Good stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
Damn, I wish I could have said something else.
"Tip you right over" was good.
Oh, okay, cool.
Uh, is she single? - Yeah, kind of.
Oh, cool, man.
Yeah.
What are you doing? Oh, I'm just gonna it's just a protein boost.
I'm just gonna eat a little.
That's not how it works, dude.
We're still in the middle of our workout.
We're not done yet? - No! Hey, whoa.
I just had a very productive conversation with the owner of the restaurant.
Action has been taken, change is in the air.
Now I'm going to go research lawsuits in my room for fun.
You okay? You seem a little off.
Stop ordering from that place.
Nick, put the dumpling down.
Hey.
Hey, what's up, Jason Street? The Internet said that I had to stay off my feet, but then I found this wheelchair in a ditch, so I'm ready to work out.
Winston, go lay down.
Nick, put the dumpling down.
Relax.
Whoops.
(gasps) Did you just gasp? (laughs) - I'm having one - Down.
I'm gonna ask you again.
Don't Don't do it.
Don't.
D I'm going to eat one bite of this.
Don't do it.
You're better than this.
I don't know if I am.
I might.
.
No.
Don't, don't.
Stop shaking it like that.
Let me eat the dumpling! - What's going on? - BOTH: Oh, just working out.
Yeah.
Just chilling.
(grunts) - Does this food have MSG in it? - JESS: What? (clenched): Oh, my God, MSG makes my jaw lock up.
You all right, dude? - What? - Mm-hmm.
What's going on with your jaw? - Yeah, dude.
(groans) Come on, you son of a Wait a minute.
Ha, "no MSG.
" Where are you going? - I'm just taking Winston for a walk.
Where are you taking me? - I think he needs some fresh air.
BOTH: Aah! Damn it, Coach.
Nick! I want you to really think about your next step.
Why do you care so much? - This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.
By you eating that, you are telling me that you'd rather sit on the couch eating dumplings than do something with your life.
Now, are you a doer or a dumpling-er? I'm sorry, I'm not you, man.
I'm a dumpling-er.
Mmm.
Oh, it's veggie.
I did all that for nothing? I tried.
Where are you taking me? - What? You're my smoking g*n.
Winston's in a wheelchair? What's next, Roberto Benigni coming through the halls, making everybody laugh? (bumps) Aah! Ow! Missing everything.
Take these.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Don't even talk.
My friend is having an allergic reaction to your food.
Hey, man.
It says "no MSG" on the menu.
It also says it with the what do you call the circle with the diagonal line? - It's the Ghostbusters thing.
What? From the movie Ghostbusters.
Oh, it says it with words an it says it with the Ghostbusters thing.
All right, just calm down.
No, here's what's going to happen.
You're going to stop putting these menus everywhere, or I'm going to show the people in here what happens when you eat the food.
I actually like the food.
Listen, Jess, Chinese food is MSG.
America is living a lie, and we distribute menus so people order the food.
Just accept that that's the way things are! No, I am done accepting things the way they are, because there are menus everywhere, and there are kids who want to see the ocean.
What? - And I don't like your vibe, dude.
(groans) Hey! This is what eating here did to my friend.
Is that crispy noodles? (Coach singing) Coach.
Oh, no, no.
What the hell are you doing, man? - I'm making island beats.
I think this is what I'm gonna do from now on, since, obviously, I can't coach.
I thought we were just messing around.
Why are you taking this so hard? Because, dude, I was trying to prove to myself that I could still do this.
Ever since Malia broke up with me I don't know I've just been a mess.
Feel like I can't do anything right.
(sighs) Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.
Get it together for real.
What are you doing here? I thought you said you were so busy.
I found this extra alarm clock, and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly, so I'll set it up for you guys.
You're welcome.
Wait a second.
What is that? - What's what? - Is that a camera? - Hmm? Schmidt, are you spying on us? So (scoffs) It is it's a camera.
Well, I'm shocked.
Schmidt, look, you decided to move out.
So move out.
I am out.
I'm actually very busy, you know that? I'm actually late for a very important coffee with a with a dear friend of mine.
Who's that? - Hmm? - Who? - Yeah.
Wouldn't you like to know? (door closes) Tiny pants man He don't have friends That's why he got the clock He got the clock to watch his only friends.
Are you enjoying your meal? Winston enjoyed his meal, right? - Until he had an allergic reaction.
MAN: Let's go.
There.
I drove away all of your customers, and I'm gonna do that every day until you stop with the menus.
Earth warrior! - You win.
I'll stop.
Thank you.
Charles? You're fired.
What? No! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Don't f*re him.
He's the menu guy.
I was just trying to make a difference.
You did.
At the beginning of the day, this guy had a job.
Now he doesn't, so congrats on your victory.
You win.
(loud guttural sob) (loud guttural sob) Do you have any teaching experience? (sobs) Does anyone have an antihistamine? You know, I just moved across the hall, but it feels like I moved across an entire ocean.
People grow up, especially young people.
So my friends don't even miss me anymore? Uh-huh.
Well, they don't miss you.
They've moved on.
What? Well, how do you know that? Because he told me.
His name is Conner, and he went to SUNY Binghamton.
I once lived with 40 birds, and they all flew away, and I moved on.
Slow down on the noodles, buddy.
Well, congratulations, Miller.
You were right.
What happened? - I terrorized a restaurant.
I got a good man fired.
I might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair, but I am ashamed of it.
So, that's what you get for trying.
Let's see what the enemy tastes like.
It's good.
Anybody want to help me use the bathroom? - No.
No.
Okay, I'll work it out.
I shouldn't have even tried.
You just get hurt.
COACH: This is such a relief.
I can get fat now.
Hey, guys, stop it! - I want to eat this all day.
Like a Chinese food mÃ©nage.
Oh! Okay, you guys are doers, and people like me, people who don't do anything we actually need people like you.
Mmm - Oh, boy, this is bad.
Uh, this Okay, all right.
I'm gonna give you guys a speech, and it's gonna f*re you guys up.
Got some on my pants - First we're gonna start with compliments to build up your confidence.
Okay, uh, - Coach, you're a great guy.
Mmm You've got strong bodies.
Aah! - What? You just need some more clients.
I believe in you.
Thanks.
Jess, you're awesome.
You are the most resourceful, optimistic, amazing person I've ever met in my life.
I can't even get my kids on a field trip.
You can do anything you put your mind to 'cause you're smart, okay? Why can't you get 'em on this field trip? There's no way to get them to the beach.
That's a board.
Karate-kick it! You're not used to making speeches, are you? Point of it is, is you never give up.
(door slams shut) Fine.
I guess you win.
I sort of miss being here.
Well, the nanny cam kind of gave it away.
Well, nobody helped me, so now there is a real mess.
Hey, Winston, do you have some money where we could rent, like, a car or a bus or something? I found this wheelchair in a ditch.
Is anyone gonna tell me anything that's going on? Stop! If it's not an idea about how to rent a car or a van, then I don't want to hear it! Wait a minute.
Nick? That's brilliant! JESS: Boys and girls, transportation provided by Hop Foo's restaurant.
All right, everybody, we did it! Ocean Conservation Day starts now! Welcome to the Pacific Ocean! Yeah.
The large body of water to my left.
No horseplay, guys.
Guys, don't talk to strangers.
And you said it wouldn't fit.
I knew it would fit.
I just didn't want you to bring it.
Careful.
It's got a trick wheel.
I think it's fine.
Okay.
Aah! Trick wheel.
Not fine.
Sorry.
(Nick grunting) Nice wheelchair.
Ms.
Day? - Hey.
Thank you.
Here.
You deserve this.
Oh, thank you.
I love it.
But you know what? I think this actually belongs to Nick Miller, 'cause he did this.
Oh, wow! - Is this your dad? - How old do you think I am, little girl? All right.
I don't want this gift.
It's her favorite hat.
(laughter) - Hey.
Hey.
You made a difference.
How's it feel? It feels good.
(laughs) Yeah, actually, it feels great.
I feel like, um I don't know.
I feel like running.
Hey, Coach, you want to show me how? - How to run? - Come on.
Coach me! Is this right, Coach? Am I doing it right? Miller, you sorry excuse for a human being, you are shaped like a bean bag chair! I will sit in you! - Ah, you can do it.
WINSTON: I'm coming, too.
'Cause I ain't a quitter! Ironside! I'm coming.
I'm com Aah! I am all-terrain, baby.
I was wrong about you, okay? You're not a quitter.
(whooping) Now, please, quit! I'm glad I got to see that.
(laughs) Oh, Schmidt, here's your key back.
We kind of like having you around.
Thanks.
This is just a copy, though.
I have like 50 of them at home.
What are you doing to me? - Your students are burying Winston.
Nah, he likes it.
Get away from me! Where are your parents at? Shoo, children, shoo! Away now, be away! Shut up, Winston! - They are so mean!
Oh! It's Coach! Coach, our old roommate? He wants to hang out tonight.
What?
He just texted me.
Oh, man, you better give Power of Attorney to a loved one, 'cause it's about to get crazy.
When Coach has the dice, every roll's a seven.
Here I am Rock you like a hurricane Nick, trumpet solo.
Yeah! You're ruining my wedding! You know, I bet this means he broke up with Malia.
I mean, that's his thing.
He finds a girl, he just disappears.
Holy crap in a hat! Schmidt! How long have you been out there? Oh, relax.
Just bringing my chimes over to the new loft.
Damn it, Schmidt! You're here all the time taking our stuff.
You decided to move out, so get new stuff.
Oh, I'm sorry that I'm more into material possessions than you.
Schmidt, you stole my toothpaste while I was using it.
That's vindictive.
That's who took the toothpaste? - Yeah.
Uh-oh, you better watch out, break of, break of dawn, because I'm about to party all up in you! - Coach texted you, too? - Yeah, man.
Well, I guess he doesn't realize you're a dill weed who doesn't live here anymore.
Well, I guess he doesn't realize that you're a dill weed who who still lives here.
Remember when you got those chimes, and there was that girl? Yeah.
What's happening? - I don't know.
I don't get it.
I had so much sex on patio furniture.
A lot of fun.
The best.
I'm still mad at you.
I'm mad at you, man! I need everyone to shut up and answer one simple question! You sons a bitches ready to party? Yeah! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Good to have you back, old man.
So, what, uh, you and Malia broke up? Oh, yeah.
She got real fat on me, so I was, like, "Ew.
Bye.
" I guess her gain is our gain! Who are you? - Hey, come Come on, man.
It's me, Jess.
Ah, yeah, no.
We lived together for, like, two weeks.
We shared some pretty big moments.
Yes! We got Bin Laden! - SEAL Team 6, bitches! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Huh.
I thought I was alone for that.
You weren't.
Anyway, I'm single, and me and my boys are gonna get crazy tonight! Huh? You know what I'm talking about, Shrimp Forks.
Oh, man.
Oh, no.
What's Shrimp Forks? It's a name I gave Winston when we played hoops.
The ball used to always slip through his little, small girly hands.
Winston Bishop, point guard Winston Bishop, point guard, R Point guard, R He couldn't palm an apple.
Old Shrimp Forks.
So, I'm thinking strip club tonight? - Hmm? - Oh, fun, fun! Fun! Fun! Uh, Nick, can I talk to you in the other room alone for a sec? Should I close the door, or do you want to just do it quietly? We're not having sex, Nick.
No, I know that.
You wanted to come here and talk.
Yeah.
A strip club on a Tuesday night? No, I know, I know, but this is just what we always used to do.
I don't want to be one of those girls, but I feel kind of uncomfortable about it.
I totally get it.
Let's go, Nick.
These dollar bills aren't gonna stick themselves in a thong.
I'm coming, my man.
Right on.
I might I might be coming, my man.
Oh, I get it.
You're whipped.
No, I'm not.
I know you had to check in with your girlfriend.
We haven't even discussed the girlfriend-boyfriend thing.
Oh, cool, man.
Let's go.
What? What a - I'm sorry, what did I just hear? - What I All I said was we haven't had the girlfriend-boyfriend discussion, which we haven't.
You don't think you're my boyfriend? No, I never said that.
I'm just talking terminology.
We've never had the terminology.
We've never had the terminology.
What? We've never used the terminology.
It's funny you act like you're my boyfriend, you have all the "privileges" of being my boyfriend.
I enjoy them.
Would like me to revoke those privileges? No, you're twisting my words.
What I'm saying, Jess, is we've never had the boyfriend-girlfriend, seeing other people conversation.
We haven't had the seeing other people conversation? You're seeing other people? No, I'm not.
Are you? - No.
Jess, I'm just We haven't had the conversation is all, and it's a conversation that I, personally, would love to have.
Uh, dude, let's go.
It's gonna close.
Geez, is she not letting you go? I'm just telling her what kind of cake to bake me, son.
Oh.
Damn! That's right.
All right.
What are you doing?! - I don't know.
What are you doing?! Jess, it's when Coach is here, - I just - No.
Nick! - I'm really sorry.
Guess what, Nick? I'm going out tonight because we haven't had the boyfriend-girlfriend talk, and we haven't had the seeing other people talk, and I'm gonna bake a cake, a pineapple upside down cake.
In terms of the metaphor, I'm really - Don't! Go to the strip club, Nick.
Knock yourself out.
Oh, don't wait up, Jebecca.
Yeah, it's Jess.
Right on.
Men suck.
Nick isn't even a man.
Mm-mm.
He's like some man-boy, man-child hybrid.
The other day, I had to tell him not to pull a dog's tail.
I shouldn't have to do that.
If a guy wants to play games, Jess, you got to play them right back.
Right, good.
Yeah.
What does that mean? - I'd make him jealous.
Yeah, right, yeah.
And there are a lot of guys out there that want to hook up with you.
There is this one guy, Artie, from the coffee shop who asked me out.
Oh, actually, you have my number.
So give me a call.
Maybe we can go out sometime.
Shut your face! You should maybe give this guy, Artie, a call and see No, that's too real.
That's just way too real.
Then why do you have his number in your phone? I just like looking at it.
It's not weird.
No.
But it has, like a lot of fours in it.
You know, you know what I mean? No, I don't.
Oh, which one of y'all want a lap dance, because WB just h*t the ATM.
Oh, hold up.
Mm-hmm.
Shrimp Forks, why'd you get so much Bunny Money? What is Bunny Money? That is Bunny Money.
That's not real money.
Look at the bill.
President Rabbit with two big ass jugs.
Damn, man.
It's fine.
As long as you didn't take out too much, you're okay.
Hey, Schmidt, I took out $2,000.
You keep making mistakes, Winston.
Oh, isn't this great, guy? - Awesome.
Yeah, man, the best.
And it's gonna keep getting better, because we're not leaving here until the sun comes up.
Whew.
Hey, yo, brick top! We about to get it popping.
Whistle while you twerk! That man has so much confidence.
It's amazing.
Until the morning? I can't do this, Schmidt.
I'm having anxiety here.
I have an 8:00 a.
m.
presentation.
That means I have to get there at 7:45 to lower everyone's chairs.
Jess hasn't texted me back.
I'm starting to freak out.
Here's what I think we should do.
I think you should be the one to just kind of tell him that we want to leave and that maybe you want to leave and then we'll all go together.
Why do I have to be the heavy? All right, fellas! All right, he's back! So I got dancers for each of us, plus one floater to play the zone.
Oh, defense! - Yeah! - Here's a crazy idea.
sh**t, man.
What if we got out of here, went back to the loft and just hung out? You're going through a big breakup.
Let's talk it out, man.
Yeah, yeah, let's just, um, go home and talk feelings.
No.
Mm-mm.
I was with Malia, now I'm not.
There, we talked about it.
Oh, look at the time.
It's butt o'clock.
You whipped.
Shut up, Schmidt.
You whipped.
Straight-up whipped.
I'm not whipped.
Whipped like cream cheese.
Yeah, you are.
Whipped like cream cheese.
Whipped! So, Cece, I'm thinking of f*ring off this text to Nick.
"Loving single life.
" Should I add a "whoo-hoo" or is that too bitchy? Look who I called.
Hey, Jess.
Shut your face.
What? Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.
Barkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze? I call it a Temple Grandin because it makes friendly and compassionate.
I have a boyfriend.
No, she No, she doesn't.
Yeah, I do.
She do.
No.
Obviously, this is a bad time, and, uh, you're involved.
In some shape or other.
No, no, no.
She's free as a bird.
Cece.
All right, well, he's a very lucky man.
I hope he realizes that.
Oh, don't move.
You've got an eyelash.
There we go.
Make a wish.
I'm afraid to.
All right, take care.
Big mistake.
I shook his hand.
I had my fun.
Do you think that Nick is in the strip club right now shaking hands? No.
Because he is a man.
You can't trust them, Jess.
Okay? The moment you let your guard down, they just walk all over you.
Tonight is the night to b*at them at their own game.
Hey, Artie! Bet you can't lift me! Uh, all sales of Bunny Money are final.
How am I supposed to spend $2,000 on dancers? Oh, no.
Our dancers don't take it.
What? - However, uh, Bunny Money is redeemable at the bar, our gift shop and our sister club in Fort Myers, Florida.
What?! Body sh*t.
You taste delicious, do you know that? What is that? An aftertaste? - Probably baby formula.
Oh Tuesday nights! Girl, you are a p*stol.
I'll tell you what, how 'bout you and me go back and I dance on you this time? Oh, man.
Tuesdays nights.
You know, for a chub, you're a terrible heavy.
Let's just get Coach really drunk until he passes out.
Then we take him home.
sh*t contest.
Like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schmidt.
I'm not ripping a page from that pro-n*zi film.
It isn't pro-n*zi.
Of course it is.
It might as well be an SS propaganda movie.
No, everybody in a n*zi uniform literally dies.
Yeah, the When she puts the hand - into the, uh - The heart.
No, not Well, that happens, too.
n*zi.
I don't think that makes you a n*zi.
They ate the monkey brains, and there was all the bugs.
n*zi, n*zi.
Nick's at a strip club, but he's just being a normal guy in his 20s that wants to hang out with other guys in their 20s.
They're all in their 30s.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Enough about Nick.
What do you do when you're not making coffee at the coffee shop?
Well, actually, I own the coffee shop.
What?
It's not as glamorous as you may think.
It's a lot of spreadsheets and jetting off to Brazil at a moment's notice.
Nick's never been to Brazil.
Maybe you should step away.
You know, call Nick up and hash things out.
Hmm-mm, can't call Nick 'cause then he'll know I'm thinking about him.
Ah.
And then he wins.
Maybe you both win.
Say Brazil again.
Brazil.
Say "rubber baby buggy bumpers."
Rubber babby buggy bumpers.
Oh, my God! sh*t contest isn't working.
It's only making him stronger.
It's Jess.
Hey, Jess, I'm so glad you called! Nick, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, is that, uh, Notorious N.
A.
G.
? - Hey! - Is that Naggie Gyllenhaal? Hey, I don't need your help checking my woman.
You're checking your woman? Wait, how did you hear that? You were covering the listening part, dummy.
Yeah, but they look the same.
I'm too drunk.
Well, I'm way drunk, too, and I'm with a man.
What? He owns a business, and he goes to Brazil.
Nick? - Oh, it's a coin flip.
Hello? He's so immature.
Jess! Jess, I got it.
Hey, I think you guys have had enough.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home? Wait, you weren't drinking? Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink.
I got to get a jump on the morning.
Well, you really have it together.
I bet you can use a phone, too.
Your bar for having it together is set pretty low.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
We can just grab a cab home.
Cece, this was your idea.
Artie, can we take your jet? Oh, it's just one coffee shop.
Wouldn't you like to know? All right, guys, give it up for Candy! Is that lobster gray? Most expensive thing on the menu.
I got to go.
What? Jess is drinking and talking to some guy.
Forget her, dude.
Relationships are prisons.
How often do we get to hang out like this? I haven't seen you in two years.
Strippers and booze forever.
Hear, hear.
There it is.
No, stop, no, no.
Relationships are not prisons, and Jess is amazing.
She's sexy and sweet, and I can't lose her.
So I'm going home to see her.
Why are you crying? We can see each other tomorrow.
I didn't break up with Malia, all right? - She broke up with me.
Why didn't you say anything, man? 'Cause I was embarrassed, Winston.
I lost her.
I was just trying to fill a void with all these naked chicks.
I don't want to be here.
I want to be in love.
Oh, Coach, this is so pathetic.
Now she's dating some dude named Derrique.
Or Derek.
Coach, you need to go home, and I need to go home, too.
You're right, man.
You have to fight for your relationships.
Freaking Derrique.
Let's go.
Mm-mmm, guys, guys, you cannot leave.
Dude, I was just crying.
I want to get out of here.
It's embarrassing.
He cried in a strip club.
All the dudes saw me cry.
Dude, I want to leave.
Man, I got Bunny Money coming out of my pockets.
Wait a minute, this ain't the way home.
Yeah, we're just gonna make a quick stop.
We're gonna kick Malia's boyfriend's ass.
Wait, this is a police station? Uh-huh, that's where he works.
You want to drunk fight a cop? He stole my girlfriend.
Did you hear the joke about the two black guys and two white guys who walked into a police station? - The two white guys came out.
I'm with Winston.
Winston? - Mm-hmm? I got two of these, and you got one more of those.
Put that away.
Coach! Coach, let's do it.
Coach, no! - Let's get raucous.
I'm ready.
We're not ready! - He is pure life force.
He's a lunatic, man.
I got to get out of here.
I want to go, too.
I got a work thing.
Well, I got a girl thing, dude.
Work trumps girls.
Girls are replaceable.
Jobs are forever.
I bet I get left with the fare.
I just bet Hey, driver, let me just ask you something.
Do you like strippers? Do you also like the deal of a lifetime? I wanted to leave first.
I've been saying that the whole night, and none of you guys can stop me.
You think that you can you can b*at me in a physical altercation of fisticuffs? I will b*at you in a way that you've never been beaten before.
Ooh.
Damn it! You got h*t in the face, son.
h*t me again.
'Cause I swear you'll be I'll be Loosen up your neck so I can put you into the headlock of a lifetime.
Guys, it's escalating, look! I'm a cop, pew, pew, pew.
No, no, no, no, no.
Thanks for the ride, Artie.
Bathroom's down the hall.
It's the one with the urinals.
I do live with men.
Nay, boys.
Look, if he can pee in Brazil, he can pee at my house.
Do you actually like this guy? - What? No, no.
Nick couldn't call me his girlfriend, and that hurt.
Now I want to hurt him back with some long, hot conversation.
That's what you really want to do? - Yes.
Men suck, remember? I'm sorry about saying that, because I put that on you, all right? That's because I'm going through something right now with Schmidt.
You have Nick.
Nick's a child who drinks on Tuesdays.
You're drinking on a Tuesday and you are a teacher.
Those kids are watching a movie tomorrow.
Look, Nick doesn't have a life plan.
He doesn't have a day plan.
I once found a note he wrote to himself that said "Put on pants" followed by a question mark.
That means it read, "Put on pants?" Also, he throws pizza at seagulls, which I guess is kind of nice because he's trying to feed them.
And he's a really, really great kisser.
You have something really good.
Just go get Artie and tell him to leave, all right? Can you just get Derek?! Hey! Hey! He's gonna get the whole precinct! This is a high-income area.
They're very bored in there.
Oh, my goodness, this jacket smells like gasoline.
Guys, come on.
Come on, man, we're too old for this.
We're too old for this whole night.
What? Life changes.
You got to grow up.
I did.
I'm in a relationship, and I'm happy.
Schmidt moved out of the loft, and he's happy.
I'm miserable! - It's your fault.
What are you talking about? I'm in a vacancy room! - A room of vacancy! Empty nest! - By choice! By choice! Let me tell you something, when I'm done with you, your face is gonna look all melted like the president at the end of Raiders.
He wasn't a president! You saw a different movie - than everybody else in the world! - I'll k*ll you! - He wasn't a president.
Guys, guys! Kick you in the butt! - Don't! You touched my penis! - Hey, hey! Don't touch my penis! Stop! Stop it! - You just touched my penis! - Hey! Hey! You touched my You guys, grow up! - You grow up.
Grow up! - Coach? What are you doing here? - Is this about Malia? - Yeah, it's about Malia.
Take care of her, man.
Yeah, I will.
I'm a cop, not some drunk loser.
Get out of here.
Should we grow up tomorrow night? Yeah.
Muscle time! - Get on the ground! - Muscle time! - I'm a cop! - Back up! - I got a badge and a g*n! - Arrest me, dude! He's got backup! Go! Go! - Go! Go! - Go! Serpentine! Serpentine! Artie, I have to h*t the hay.
Oh, dear! Don't worry.
I'm gonna make you coffee in the morning.
It's been a really great evening, what a treat it's been, but I think somewhere along the way, some signals got crossed.
Signals could not have been any clearer.
Come on in.
The water's warm.
Are you splashing me? I'm fixing to mix you up.
Seriously? Oh, men are such dicks.
All right, guys, second wind.
You got an old TV? Let's throw it off the roof.
Come on, you're crashing with me.
And you, go talk to your girlfriend.
Thanks.
Hey, it was a fun night.
All right, guys.
Let's go, Shrimp Forks.
Coach, Shrimp Forks? Come on, man, that makes no sense.
I played professional basketball.
You got to stop calling me that.
I'm sorry, man.
Hop along, Bunny Money.
Better than Shrimp Forks.
I'll take that.
Fantastic.
It only cost you $2,000.
It did, didn't it? The Brazilians have the same word for making love to one woman as they do for making love to two.
Mah-gaa-leesh.
Take off your tops and say it with me.
Jess! Oh, my God, that's Nick! Okay, okay, you-you just get him dressed.
I will stall Nick.
I am really good at this kind of thing.
Oh, my God.
Nick, hey, great.
I've been wanting to talk to you about this side table.
What kind of wood is it made out of? Jess, I failed! Jess.
Welcome, brother.
Oh, my God.
Nick, I can't imagine what you must be thinking right now.
Actually, I can.
This is your worst nightmare.
There's a very good-looking man in my bed, and he's naked, and I'm flushed, and I'm flustered.
I might as well just spray paint "Jay Cutler sucks" on the wall and just round out the whole image, right? But, Nick, nothing happened, and nothing was ever going to happen, and you have to believe me, please.
Say you believe me, please.
I believe you.
Do you have any questions? Do you want me to have questions? Well Hey, Artie? I'm gonna need you to get out of my girlfriend's bed, man.
Well, uh, I'm naked and-and in bed, and you're fully clothed and standing, so I mean, I hardly think this would be a fair fight.
Well, I'd like it to be a fair fight.
Thank God for snaps.
Men are so weird.
I must warn you, while spending time in Brazil Let get situated first before we get into this thing.
Oh, my God! - Bye-bye.
Don't die, big guy.
Hey.
Hey.
You called me your girlfriend.
Did I? I don't remember.
Where's Winston with the food? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It was crazy at the V-Rab.
Bachelor party season.
I got a deep-dish gyrator, no mushrooms.
That's me.
Don't call it V-Rab.
Please.
I got the main stage fish tacos.
No regrets.
Great order.
Pour some sugar on meatballs? - Oh, that's me.
Thank you.
Let's see, and I got the short stack ass-clap pancakes.
You want to switch? - Schmidt, you want a taco? - No, I'm gonna take one of Winston's.
Take it if you want it, dude.
I was just thinking maybe-maybe you guys could chip in a little bit.
'Cause it was expensive.
You want one of Winston's tacos? I'll take 50 cents on the dollar, I really would.
I really would.
Please?
Hey, what took you so long? Come on in.
Hey.
No, no.
Why are we having a secret meeting in an empty loft? Because I don't want Schmidt to find us.
It's creepy, right? - I know, right? - Yeah, it is.
This place gives me the willies, man.
Do you know why they can't keep a tenant in here? - Why? - Because Mrs.
Beverly d*ed on the toilet.
And to come here on Halloween? - Seems risky.
What's risky? The ghost situation.
I brought you guys in here to talk about Schmidt.
I'm really worried about him.
He hasn't been to work for three days.
He just sits on the couch eating cold cuts and yelling at the news about how nothing matters.
It's a problem.
Right.
Be honest, it's a real problem.
He's just going through a whole thing, you know? The Cece-Elizabeth breakup has gotten to him.
Right now he is completely unhinged.
Y'all feel that? - What is going on? Not saying there's a ghost, but I felt a weird breeze go through my body, - that's all I'm saying.
There's no ghost.
Guys, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss the old Schmidt.
I want him to be happy again.
He's crumbling before our very eyes.
And I'm having a party tonight, and I just can't have him lying on the couch, wiping his tears with deli meat.
I'll talk to him, okay? - Thank you.
People get weird with breakups.
Trust me, I got this.
You got this.
That was Winston.
Was that you or was that in here, dude? - That was Don't do that! Oh, come on, Obama.
t*nk pull in, t*nk pull out.
Babies are born, old people die.
And yet the world keeps spinning and spinning and spinning, and one day, it stops.
And then what? You want you want to talk about health care? That's mayo, buddy.
Yeah, I don't got this.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
Season 3, Episode 6 "Keaton" - Pumpkining - You're really good at that.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
What are you carving there? - It's a pumpkin.
Oh, look at that.
That's beautiful.
My pumpkin! - Pumpkin doesn't matter.
Hey.
I just wanted to talk to you, um - About my party tonight.
You don't want me to come to the party? No, no, no, no, no, no.
Jess, do you not want me to come to your party? - No.
I No.
Doesn't matter.
I wouldn't go if I weren't throwing it, you know? It's, like, more of a business-networking It's not a big deal at all.
I just won't come.
I'll stay at home, and I'll just hang out in my costume.
Oh, wait a minute.
Your home is my home.
See you at the party.
What the hell? - He's a total maniac.
Well, you know what, Jess? He doesn't get like this often.
But when he does, oh, there is an option.
Nick, I think it's time for Schmidt - to get a letter from an old friend.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What old friend? - Forget you heard anything.
What old friend? - Nothing, J - We need him, Nick.
No, we don't.
We got to bring him back.
Bring who back? - Winston, don't do this! - Guys, does nobody listen to me?! - without him! - Who is he? - Michael Keaton.
You stupid Michael Keaton, the actor? The Batman? Nick, are you gonna tell her, or should I? - I'm not telling her.
Fine.
I'll do it.
You will? - When Schmidt was seven years old You're a terrible storyteller.
I'll just do it myself, I guess.
When Schmidt was seven years old, his daddy divorced his mommy And Schmidt was left without the love of a father.
He didn't take it well.
He began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate.
Mrs.
Schmidt tried everything to cheer him up, but nothing worked.
Desperate, she looked to the stars.
Movie stars.
Mrs.
Schmidt wrote that little fat loser a letter of support from the star of his favorite movie, Batman.
But not the confusing new one.
The good one, with Michael Keaton.
And when Schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands on Keaton's letter, his life changed forever.
Yes! But the real trouble was just beginning.
You see, Schmidt wrote back.
And he kept writing back about any problem he faced: bullies, schoolwork, public erections.
And for every letter he sent, Michael Keaton sent one back.
Was Winston's version shorter? Then one day, that tubby goon went off to college.
Whoa.
So Mrs.
Schmidt unloaded the secret on her son's only friend, a man named me.
It was me.
Yeah, I got that.
Really? People don't No, I got it.
College proved tough for Schmidt, and old patterns soon returned.
It became impossible to study, and I knew what I had to do.
And again - New message.
It worked.
With Keaton in his corner, he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey - and became a man.
One He lost five pounds, gained confidence with women and he saw the h*t movie Multiplicity - 25 times.
Oh, my God.
You've been cat fishing Schmidt.
Do you think we could use this whole Michael Keaton thing - to turn Schmidt around? - Absolutely.
Great! - But I won't do it.
Why not? - Because I put it to bed, okay? It's over.
He'll do anything Keaton says.
The letters are too powerful.
I'm lying to my best friend.
And I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.
Well, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick? Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.
But I won't do it.
Sorry.
You think you tell that story better than me? Look, you leave out way too many details, man.
You don't just say he was chewing a candy bar.
You say he was chewing on a nougat-y candy bar.
That's not the kind of writer I am.
I don't say words like "nougat-y.
" I'm simple.
I'm like Hemingway.
Hey, Cece.
Oh, hey.
I came to find out if you're coming to my party today.
You never answered my e-mail.
Yeah, I meant to, uh to tell you I can't make it.
Sorry.
Um I've been going out drinking a lot lately.
It's kind of wiping me out.
Please come to my party, Cece.
It's Schmidt, you know? - I don't think I'm ready for that, so - Yeah.
What if I could promise you Schmidt wouldn't be there? Who wants candy? - Did you go trick-or-treating? - No.
I was out, I had my errand tote, and a couple of neighbors gave me candy.
Is that trick-or-treating? Yes, that's the definition of trick-or-treating, Jess.
Hello! Uh, Jess, I'd like you to know that I've changed my mind, and I won't be coming to your party tonight.
I've been e-mailing with an old friend of mine, and he made me realize - that I should give Cece her space.
An old friend, huh? Well, Nick knows.
You know, I don't like to throw his name around because I don't like people treating me any differently, but It's Michael Keaton.
What?! Uh, okay.
Calm down.
The actor?! Seriously, you guys.
Don't treat me any different.
He's kind of my friend.
Michael Keaton.
There was one time he e-mailed me.
He said he was my best friend.
Anyway, we have so much catching up to do, me and Michael, so just enjoy the night.
That's crazy, Schmidt.
Ah, man.
What did you do? - Jessica Damn Day.
I just got Schmidt to not come to the party.
Keaton hasn't written Schmidt in three years.
We have no idea how Schmidt is gonna react.
If Schmidt finds out Keaton isn't real, it'll destroy the entire life he has built around him.
We are talking about a Truman Show situation.
Oh, yeah, I love that movie.
What part are you talking about? Well, I'm talking about the part in the movie when Truman realizes that his whole life is a lie, and then he goes crazy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there in the middle of the movie.
No, it's the whole movie.
Oh, yeah, I know, I was just 'cause there's the one - There's like a scene.
You haven't seen it.
He didn't see the movie.
Okay, guys, he almost found out once.
Now, luckily, I handled it.
I don't understand.
In 1995, he told me specifically that he had never been to Nicaragua.
It doesn't make any sense.
Aah! You have no idea what you've done.
Hey, uh, you guys, do you think that it's too early to e-mail Michael back? Should I send him an e-card? Does that change anything, or does that change everything? - I think you're overthinking it.
You know what? - You're right.
You're right.
Be cool.
I think I'm way too up here, all upstairs.
Got to bring it down here to here.
Not any lower, though.
It's not like that.
I know it's not.
Bro, it's not like that.
No one thinks it is, bro.
Cool.
All right.
He's already getting weird.
Here.
No, Je You come to the master.
What are you writing? I fixed it again.
You're welcome again.
So you just wrote from Keaton, "I'm going on vacation"? He would never write that, Jess.
Why not? - Vacation?! Oh, Michael, you stop going away.
I knew this would happen.
Hey, Schmidt.
Schmidty.
He left me again.
It makes sense.
Why would a guy like Michael Keaton be friends with me anyway? I'm sure he likes you a lot, Schmidt.
Why would he? I guess I'll just always be the fat boy who eats fat-boy cheese.
I didn't want to have to do this.
Oh, is that really necessary, Nick? - Shh.
What? Let him work.
I'm kind of like his Robin.
You're not like my Robin.
You want to be Robin? He doesn't have all the responsibilities of Batman, but he can take some of the glory.
Robin's a joke.
Robin's the joke.
I think we can all agree.
The kids look up to him, you know, in the community.
I haven't been inside Keaton's mind in a long time, and I need my proper inspiration.
Thank you.
Why do you have a picture of a bear? The great Michael Keaton att*cks each new role with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear.
It is his entire acting philosophy, which I totally made up.
I sleep with this person.
Speak to me, Keaton.
Mmm.
Here we go.
Oh, hey, Nick, that's incredible.
"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it"? Yes, I stole that from Nelson Mandela.
I added the part about the Penguin and the Riddler.
Oh.
All right.
Is that him? Did it work?
He wrote back smiley face.
He wrote back smiley face.
He wrote back smiley face.
Trick or treat!
Oh, how adorable.
You know, I just got a treat, too.
It's not candy; I'm not a Not a dumb little baby like all of you.
"Happy Hallow's Eve.
" And send.
Just give us our candy.
Hush, little boy.
He wrote back.
"Hi.
" - Okay, I got this.
"Speak to me, old chum.
"I canceled my trip to provide earthquake relief.
This seemed more important.
" Boom.
That's so good.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
You really have the Keaton voice down.
"You're a friend for life.
" - That's good.
"M.
K.
" - I think that's good.
I think that's really good, actually.
Hi.
Welcome.
Happy Halloween.
Drinks are over there.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you supposed to be? - I'm Joey Ramona Quimby.
I don't get it.
Joey Ramone a Quimby.
What are you? You look like you're just wearing trash from your car.
No, I'm not.
I'm the Paper Mountain Trash King I just got trash from my car.
And now the man who once played center for the New York Knicks in the nude, David Letterman! - That is a terrible Letterman.
Really? People at work tell me I look just like Dave.
You look just like Letterman.
You know, I have always thought that.
What, uh, what uh, Nick, Nick Miller.
So you a, uh? You're a - What is that? - That's, that's his laugh.
He's never done that.
That's his laugh.
Do you like my costume? I'm a public serpent.
Um, I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, I changed my mind.
You know, I reread a few of Keaton's e-mails.
He can be quite cryptic.
I think what he meant when he said that life was meaningful was really, "Go to the party.
" - I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.
I know Keaton best.
Hey, Winston, by the way, great costume.
Maya Angelou.
Crap.
What am I gonna do? Cece's on her way.
Schmidt is rereading e-mails.
Do you know what happens after rereading? Figuring it out.
It's The Truman Show.
Truman Show, man, I love that movie.
I'm not convinced you've ever seen it.
I have; it's about the Civil w*r.
Batcave? - Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
Winston, go to Cece's and stall.
Okay, fine.
But I got to h*t the little King of the Late Night Talk Show's room first.
Maybe slow down on that.
You're not great with booze.
Hey, I got it, I got it.
You got it? Good.
Um, "You're in grave danger.
Leave where you are immediately.
" - Send.
Okay.
Don't! - You just sent that? - Yeah.
A team has to talk about a decision before you h*t send.
Sorry.
I thought it was a really good move.
Trick or treat.
Shh.
All right, you got to fix this.
I'll meet you at your building in 30 minutes.
Terrible! Send.
No! - What? Now what are we gonna do? - You told him Keaton was coming here? - No, Nick.
Are you out of your mind? - It's a stall! It's a stall Until we can come up with a better plan.
Well, who the hell is that? - I don't know.
Trick or treat! You.
I don't get what you're doing! Are you drunk? A little.
What's your endgame here? - It's Halloween night.
This is the night when anyone can dress up in a costume and be anybody that they want.
Would you listen to your woman voice for one second? Oh, you think I'm gonna talk to him in a woman voice when I'm talking to him? No, I have a character.
You're doing a character? Well, I'd love to hear it.
I'm the Batman.
Oh.
Right? So good.
What, am I in the movie theater, eating popcorn? Jess, you're also five, four.
Keep going further away.
The further you're away, the bigger you look.
I would say run a little bit.
Nick! Jess, go! Go - Hey.
Uh, Nick.
Hey.
By chance, have you seen anyone famous in the vicinity? This vicinity? Famous? Like, um - Look that way.
What? - Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Well, it's my hero.
Yeah.
That is Michael Keaton.
Right there.
Why is he wearing his costume from the movie he did 24 years ago? If he wore the outfit from Clean and Sober, you wouldn't recognize him.
I'm the Batman.
It's Halloween.
Don't overthink it.
Well, you saw him.
There he is.
Let's get out of here.
I have to meet him, Nick.
I have to.
No, you don't have to meet him.
No, no, no You're a great kid, Sch You're a great kid, Schmidt.
No.
Let me take you out to eat.
I want to buy you something - 'cause you met your hero.
Go to an all-night diner.
No, I have to meet Got to meet him.
He's got to - It's Michael Keaton! - Go get a blintz or two! Aah! - Michael! It's me Schmidt.
See you later, Michael! Take off! We have so much to talk about.
Our heroes are never who we want them to be! Oh.
Oh.
You met him.
It's Keaton.
Come on, you guys.
I know.
I've known the whole time.
What, do you think I'm stupid? No.
It just I Just don't really know what to say in this situation.
Look, please don't blame Nick.
It's not his fault.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
How dare you hack into the private e-mail account of one of our nation's finest actors! I'm gonna have to tell Michael about this.
No! No! - No, don't tell Michael! - Jess, please stop.
Thank you for what you're trying to do, but it's over.
It has to be over.
Schmidt, I'm Michael Keaton.
I'm the owner of the e-mail address KeatonPotatoes@aol.
com.
What? It was me The whole time.
No - No, you can't - How do you think I know that you kissed the bus driver at spring break? Or that you want to open up a glassware boutique in Connecticut? - Or about the wall hole? - This is impossible! I've been I've been writing with Michael Keaton since I was a kid! Your mother came up with the idea, Schmidt.
But since college, it's been me.
My mom? You're gonna tell me that my mom helped me with my public erections? I drew pictures! He didn't want you to find out this way.
Hey.
I got to go.
Wait.
Schmidt! - Oh! Oh, I'm so, so sorry.
Uh - A bully! Get him! Oh! Oh! - Come on.
Hey, kids, get out of here! Scat! Scat! Back off! Cece, wait.
I swear, I did not know he was gonna be here.
I'm so sorry.
No, Jess.
It's-it's fine.
Okay, it's fine.
In fact it's actually kind of perfect.
I think, since this whole thing went down, I've just been running away.
You know, I mean, actually seeing Schmidt, I I finally feel like I have some closure.
Well, good.
I'm glad.
You deserve some.
So let's f*re up the Batman Mobile, go to a taco stand and eat some feelings, okay? Okay, I just I think it's Batmobile.
Batman Mobile.
No.
Batmobile.
That's what I said Batman Mobile.
You're putting the man There's no man.
It's just Bat - Batman Mobile.
Mobile.
Batman Mobile.
Batmobile.
Drop the man.
Bat Yeah.
Batman Mobile.
Batmobile.
Batmo-mobile.
So it was you who helped me through my first breakup with Elizabeth? Yeah, Schmidt.
And it was you, not Keaton, who told me that women aren't attracted to men who wear maternity pants? Yes, but that one I feel like I shouldn't have had to.
They're unbelevably comfortable.
What about that time that we saw Michael Keaton at that deli, and he stopped, and he winked? Honestly, I can't explain that one.
It was just the weirdest day of my whole life.
My friend Michael.
Oh, Schmidt, look, I know this is hard, okay? But honestly, I was just trying to help.
You don't need Keaton.
You got me.
What was that? - I'm so sorry.
What Why would you say something like that? Because I hurt you, and I've been wanting to fix this for years.
The end of a high school football movie? I'm really sorry I pretended to be Keaton for the last 12 years.
It's super weird.
Are we good? Yeah.
We're good.
Well, Nicholas, I came to a decision last night.
I'm entering a new chapter in my life, and I think it best that I do it alone.
You're going to one of those weekend spas again, buddy? No.
In the famous words of singer-songwriter Billy Joel - Don't do this.
I'm moving out.
You're the worst.
Schmidt, I thought you said we were good.
No, we're great, but I'm going.
Two separate things.
I made the call this morning.
I got a new place.
I'm out.
You're not going anywhere.
I'm going.
Goodness, uh, I think somebody had sex in my bedroom last night.
I think that because they're still in there - Having sex, I think.
Ugh! Hey, Schmidt.
You going to a weekend spa again? - No.
Striking out on my own.
Wait.
What?! You're moving out? He's not moving out, is he? Schmidt, you can't move out.
Who's gonna do my fades? Yeah, who's gonna do his fades? Believe this is mine.
Well, I bid you all adieu.
Stop it, Schmidt.
Oh, Schmidt! - Are you serious? - Schmidt, come on.
Come on.
Seriously? Come on! - Stop with the show! You can't even fit all your socks in that suitcase.
Get your last looks, 'cause who knows when we'll see each other again? Or where.
Wait.
You're just moving in across the hall? I can't hear you 'cause I'm gone.
Schmidt, it would take me longer to walk from the kitchen to the bathroom than it would from here to where you are.
Oh, you are kidding me.
I can see your feet! - Me, too.
Shut up.
Guy's an idiot See you tomorrow, Schmidt Woo! I'm alone! I'm alone! I'm alone I'm alone Score, touchd Hahaha Yeah.
Shut up, Winston.
Damn, man.
You look tired.
Your eyes are puffy as hell.
I'm unwell, Winston.
I'm just torn up about this whole Cece and Elizabeth thing.
I feel so guilty, I can't even look at myself in the mirror.
Do you think that I'm good person? I'm gonna Hey, guys, do you guys think that I'm a good person? You're a terrible person.
It's hilarious.
You cheated on my best friend, Schmidt.
F-Fair enough.
Okay.
Well, I'm better than Winston.
You're better at things than Winston, but he's a better person.
Winston freakin' stinks! - Okay, why am I being dragged into this? Because I'm mad, Winston.
And I'm tired.
And I'm a good I'm a good man.
Are you crying? I got a package for Nick Miller.
There's nobody here by that name.
I got this.
I saw that.
Run, Nick! Run! - Aah! What? Relax, I'm with your late father's estate.
Pop-pop? - This is for him.
What's in there? It's a hand, isn't it? Just tell me if it's a hand.
Oh, my God! - It is a hand.
It's a I knew it.
It's a hand.
What does that mean, though? Full of dollar bills, y'all! You are rich, man! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess I can't believe Nick's dad left him $8,000.
I've never seen someone burn through money so fast.
I should say something.
Some of these shoes aren't even his size.
Look, Jess, you don't want to talk to Nick about money, okay? It is a very touchy subject.
I'm gonna check out this fancy picture place.
Seems like rich guys always have pictures of themselves.
My man.
Do you, baby.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Nick owes me is my opportunity to get it back.
How are you expecting to get your money back if he bl*ws it all on stupid stuff? Oh, don't worry, Jess.
I have a plan.
Hey, listen, you know you don't have to con him if he actually owes you money.
You can just ask him.
I just told you to ask him for the money.
Smile Do the crystals make it look too glamorous? It's really glamorous.
I don't even know.
I don't know what's cool anymore.
It could be a good time to start a bank account.
Yeah, or I could just flush it down the toilet.
It's not really the same thing, but A bank is just a paper bag but with fancier walls.
That's all it is.
I'm gonna keep my money where my mouth is.
Um, under my nose.
That saying actually does work.
What is that? - This is my box.
It's where I keep all my junk that I don't feel like dealing with.
That looks like a lot of bills.
It's mostly bills.
Like I said, it's junk.
You know, I'm just brainstorming here, but what if you paid some of those bills with the money you just got? Yeah.
I'm gonna "pay my bill.
" And what's next? I'm gonna go to the doctor and get a checkup.
Give them $500 to check my bones.
You're being funny.
So, yeah, I was dating both of them at the same time.
I'm a mess.
I can't sleep.
I urinate constantly.
I cried the other day listening to a techno song.
My tweets have been extremely literal.
Were the girls Jewish? One Indian, one regular.
Do you want to see a picture? I-I don't even know why you're here.
You come in and say, "Do you have a minute?" Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Rabbi.
It's just that Okay, it's much more simple.
How can I be a better person? Oh.
Well, you seem awfully concerned with yourself.
You might want to start thinking about the needs of others.
I think about others all the time.
What-what I can get from them, how they can give me pleasure, do they have a silly little walk - that I can make fun of? - No, th-that's It's where you actually care about somebody else.
You put their needs ahead of your own.
This is one of the few times that I wish I was Catholic.
Couple Hail Marys and I'd be off the hook.
Huh? Oh, God.
Whoa.
Are you choking? You're choking.
Okay.
Uh What, are you biking and eating? All right, I got you, I got you.
Come on! Live! Live! Live, biker! - Ew.
Yeah! - Thank you.
You saved my life.
What? You saved my life.
You saved my life.
I did.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you Thank you Yes! Dude! This is exactly what I needed.
Oh, my God.
Let us rejoice in song.
Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil Adonai Eloheinu - Please call 911.
I'm hurt.
Oh, yeah, no, that's a great idea.
I'm gonna call 911.
I hope you don't have a dance recital later.
I'm just kidding.
Don't look at your legs.
That's, uh, $900 to the Parking Authority of Los Angeles.
Oh, is it okay to mail cash? I'm gonna do it anyway.
All right, it's on its way.
Sliders are beautiful.
I know, man.
I knew you would think that.
I love 'em, dude.
That's why I made 'em.
What is that? Brotherhood.
Brotherhood, man.
All right, man.
I respect you, man, no matter what.
That's what it's about, man.
Yeah, and, um in the spirit of brotherhood just 'cause we on that level right now I was just thinking - maybe, I don't know, um - Anything, man.
sh**t.
Oh, man.
Maybe you can just pay me back that money that you owe me.
Remember? 'Cause you owe me that money? - Uh, Nick? Nick? - Oh - Nick? Nick? Hey, Nick.
Oh, you stink! - Um, can we? - You son of - You son of a bitch, Winston! - Can we can we That's what this is about?! Nick, it's my money, okay?! Give it back to me! I make a little bit of money and you come slipping out of the "woodword"! You mean "woodwork"? What is "woodwork"?! What's "woodword"?! Wood! Word! Wood! Word! That's where people like you come crawling out of when people like me have money! - But you owe me that money! - Stay out of my damn box - is the point, man! - I'm not in your box! Jess gets it, right? Yeah, what's What the hell, dude? I'm gonna go to the bar to blow off some steam.
That's a great idea.
Go get loaded.
You deserve it.
Black out.
You are the only one that I trust around here.
Oh You went through Nick's box.
Look, it was so much worse than I thought.
Why does he have the deed - to an old Mercury Cougar in there? - Oh, yeah, he lost that.
For crying out loud, where is it? We've been looking for hours.
It's done.
What about your car, Nick? I said it's done.
I'll just get the money back.
Bill collectors are reasonable people, right? - That makes sense.
You better keep your mouth shut! I'll make you a deal.
I'll keep my mouth shut if you pay me the money Nick owes me.
Are you trying to blackmail me? You don't scare me, Jess.
How much does Nick owe you? $1,900.
But what is money anyway? You know, it's just paper that some king on the mountains said was worth something.
You know? Gold, I understand.
It's shiny and you can make jewelry out of it.
Silver? Put a werewolf in front of me, he's d*ad.
Brass creates the bells that make sound throughout the land.
But we k*ll each other for paper.
I gotta tell you, man, that's sad.
You give me $50, I'll show you my private parts.
Nicholas, good yontef.
Are you well? - No, but good yontef.
You know, I'm all steamed up.
This money thing is tearing me apart, Schmidt.
All right, if it's bothering you that much, why don't you just give it away? Son of a bitch! Not, not to me, Nick, to charity, or tzedakah as my people call it.
That's what your people do? - Yeah.
You beautiful genius.
I like that.
That frees me of my worries.
Oh, look at that! Another mitzvah! I'm two for two today.
Yeah! Mitzvah! - I saved a man.
You know, there was a lowly bike messenger.
Was just riding along, choking on his gum.
And I performed Heimlich's maneuver on him, rescued him.
Great.
Yeah, who's the good man now? You're almost forced to admit it.
Almost You're almost forced to admit it.
Yeah, I know.
I'm a hero, Nick, now Just tell me that I'm a good man.
I really need to hear it.
I don't even know if I'm a good person.
I'm not the guy to ask.
I have my moods.
But we're not talking about you.
We're talking about me right now and how I'm a good person, so it'd be really nice if you could say that.
I'm ready to do a tzatziki.
Tzedakah.
This is not about tzedakah right now.
This is about me being a good man and you telling me that.
Absolutely.
So, well, say it.
You got it.
S-Say that I'm a good man.
I'm giving away my money.
I've been trying to listen - to you this whole time! - Damn it, Nick, you are so drunk right now - and at the bar you work at, no less.
Yeah.
What happens with the rest of your day? Do you even think about that? You don't understand drinking at all.
Don't go.
Heathcliff.
Hi, I'd like to unpay some parking tickets.
Excuse me? - Well, I sent in a payment earlier for some tickets and I decided I don't want to pay them.
Well, just cancel the checks.
Can't do that 'cause I paid cash 'cause my boyfriend doesn't believe in banks.
It's early in the relationship.
Still shaving above the knee if you know what I mean.
Mm-hmm.
Let me get this straight You want me to watch the mail and let you know if I see anything from your boyfriend.
Exactly.
Fantastic.
Should I call you or? - Text, text would be great.
Perfect.
Let me put your number into my phone.
I didn't give you my number yet.
Oh, I think you did.
It's your lucky day, old friend.
I had an interesting talk with Schmidt, and I've decided to give away my fortune.
So, what do I owe you? - How much money d? Uh - Hey, guys, what's going on? Hey, Jess, um It's tzatziki is what it's called.
It's a Jewish charity.
Nick was just about to pay me the money that he owes me.
Wait! Come on, what are you doing? I'm, uh, I'm lubing up, Sally From ankles to ears? The door's locked You want me to bust in? Son of a It opened! Where are you? Um, I just was hot, I wanted some shade.
Oh, done that.
He take my money? Winston! It was me, it was me, it was me.
I'm so sorry, I went through your box I just couldn't help it and I paid some of your bills, and I'm so sorry I Hey, Nick You gonna leave me here? Nick That's fair.
There he is, alive and well.
Yeah.
Mazel.
I br-brought you these.
How's my brave little soldier doing, huh? Not great.
They said that I'm never gonna be able to ride a bike again, - so there goes my job.
Sure, sure.
Do you think that I'm a good person? I I don't really know you.
Well, what more do you need to know? If not for me, you probably would have d*ed today.
Well, somebody probably would have come along.
Just say that I'm a good person.
Well, I mean - Why is that so hard for you to say? - Ow! - I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
You're, you're a good person.
I am? You really think so? Very good.
Thank you for saying that.
Yeah.
That really means It means a lot.
I finally feel like I can breathe again.
Good.
What happ What happened to him? Well, he got smoked by a bus while he was having a bake sale for cancer kids.
For, for canc for cancer kids? - Yeah.
But he-he's, he's a great person.
Bad things happen to good people all the time.
Of course they do.
What am I even chasing here? What is the point of being a good person? Some say moral integrity is the cornerstone to humanity.
What do you know, you idiot? You choked on a piece of gum today.
Hey, man, don't sh**t the bike messenger.
That is a terrible joke! And none of this makes any sense! Hey, Nick.
Look, I know you're really angry and you have a right to be.
I have the right to be? I mean, why do you feel like you need to fix me? It's like you think you know better.
Well, I m I might know better than you.
Did you start a corporation? - Was it Fat Face? - I think so.
Yeah.
Well, you're getting taxed like crazy.
Well, that's because I thought I was filing a patent.
Fat Face is an invention? Kind of in its intention It was suppo it - Are you a lifeguard? - No, that is a false certificate.
Just a classic beach prank.
That seems dangerous.
It's funny, 'cause I I can't swim.
Everyone was watching me, and I'm like, "I don't know" I was 13! I was 26.
This is the problem with the box.
It's my private stuff.
You've never once done jury duty or paid your taxes.
Not until gay marriage is legal everywhere.
I stand by that.
And I don't want to do jury duty or pay taxes.
Nick, you're in so much debt, it's crazy.
You have to deal with this stuff.
No, I don't, Jess, it's in my box.
That's not true, though.
It's not a perfect system, Jess, but it's mine, okay? And it's private.
Well, I'm sorry I went through your damn box, but I was just trying to help you, Nick.
So maybe I'll try to help you.
What if I went into your box? Not that.
Stop it! - I like that box, but I'm mad at you! I'm back to "You disrespected me.
" - I was just trying to help.
Well, then, how about this Two can help.
Okay? And if two are going to help, then I'll be one of them 'cause two can tango on this dance, okay? So, you want to waltz? Well, you picked the wrong dance partner.
Two can play.
What? It's not a Who needs changing, huh, who needs fixing? I'm gonna go through your personal drawers and see what needs changing.
What are you, a zoo elephant? Those are my night peanuts.
There shouldn't be day peanuts and night peanuts! They're just peanuts! I'm sorry, why is that weird? You just have a bunch of boxes? I would change that.
Oh, you have a bunch of metal toothpicks.
They're bobby pins.
What's a bobby pin? - It keeps your hair back.
You need Bobby's pins to put your hair up? It's bobby pins, not Bobby's pins.
What is this?! - Yarn.
What are you knitting, a mansion?! Oh, look at this.
What do we have here? A bunch of b*at-up old sacks.
My vintage purses.
Well, you know what? - They could be sexier.
You want my purses to be sexier? Would it k*ll you to get something sleek, covered in gems for once? You want my purses to be covered in gemstones? All guys do! That's what we think is sexy! We want to be playing a saxophone in an alley and have you walk by in a miniskirt with a purse with gems.
But you girls don't listen! - What?! - Changing! - No! Nick, no! - This all is changing.
No, no, stop! That's disrespectful! - Gone! - Nick, stop it! No! This is the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life! - I got that for a nickel.
It's disgusting.
You're just trying to get a rise out of me.
Oh, my God! I've gotten a lot of compliments on that one.
Gone! - Nick! What? Stop it! Look, I like you the way you are.
I'm just asking you to grow a little.
Are we ever gonna get to a point where you stop working on me? Instead of changing me, maybe once, Jess, see it my way.
Well, your way's crazy and illegal.
This is me, take it or leave it.
I'm not changing for anyone.
Hey, where are you going? If you have something to say, just say it.
Don't write me a note or That's the money I spent.
Do what you want with it.
Thank you.
Couple of best friend horses.
That's neat.
What else can you get on? It doesn't make any sense.
Can you not see I'm in the middle of a bar mitzvah class here? Yeah, well, they should hear this.
A man helping cancer kids got creamed by a bus today.
Everything happens for a reason.
But what if it doesn't happen for a reason? Maybe Maybe there aren't any good guys and bad guys.
Maybe there are just winners and losers.
I was b*ating myself up, but maybe I should Maybe I should have been celebrating.
Have you ever dated two women at once? - What are you talking about? I went to camp They used to call me the Octopus.
Clearly, you have not, sir.
That's enough.
You get out of here right now! - Out.
Don't you "out" me.
Get out, get - Getting a little handsy there, Rabbi.
Get out! - You know what I realize? Nothing matters, and that's great.
You know why? Because if nothing matters, we can do whatever we want, Rabbi.
Avram! Julio! Get away from me, man.
Kick his ass! All right, okay.
YOLO! YOLO! Nick's right.
I have too many purses.
You're addicted to purses.
I'm addicted to development fluid.
I get it.
This one's for meat, and this one's for shells.
You know what? - Keep them.
They're yours.
Okay, thanks.
Also, heads up The ass of your pants is missing.
It's for the kitty cats.
My phone's ringing.
Sure.
Hello? I'm like a pretty lady.
What's happening? I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Day, but this man was trying to open an account with a check in your name and a paper bag full of money.
Would you please stop hovering? I'm being cooperative.
It's fine.
He's okay.
Thank you, though.
Opening a bank account, huh? Yeah, I, uh - I realized something.
What? I'd do anything for you, Jess.
Hey.
Thank you.
All right, Mr.
Miller, your checking account is good to go.
Oh, there's just an eight dollar processing fee.
Eight dollars? That's a very specific amount.
That's fine It's your world, your rules, so Excellent.
You go to the castle, you got to pay the king.
What is processing? What does that mean? It's just a word you use to make more money off of us.
That makes me mad! - Me, too, yeah.
Hey, how about this? What's a bank? - Yeah.
It's just a paper bag - That's right.
Yes! - with walls.
You're making some really, really, really good points, ma'am.
You are the puppeteers that puppet the world.
No more banks! Or some banks I don't care! But I want my money on a boat! I understood at least 30% of the financial crisis, and guess what I got from that? - You suck! - Yeah.
You suck so hard.
And now, I'm gonna process this man's face, 'cause I think he's great.
And I'm crazy about him.
Fine, I'll waive the fee.
Yeah! We won eight dollars! Just wait till you have children.
You'll never touch each other again.
Banks suck! Banks suck! What the hell happened to you? Got b*at up by some rabbis.
Well, Winston, we're all alone.
Nothing matters.
But you know what? Look Schmidt, stop, all right? You're a good man.
You did a bad thing doesn't make you bad.
We just have to try to be better, you know? Been waiting all day for somebody to tell me that.
I I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
I want you to have something.
Winston, literally, a gift is the last thing I des - This is - There you go.
This is a candelabra.
Yeah.
I bought it with the money that Nick owed me.
This is what you spent it on? - And now it's yours.
Uh-huh.
May it illuminate your path and lead you out of the darkness.
That's what it says on the bottom.
May it illuminate your path, lead you out of darkness.
Uh, uh, thank you for this really.
Look at it every single day and tell yourself "I'm a good person," 'cause you are.
You know what I might do, though? And it might seem like the opposite, but what I'm actually thinking is, maybe I'll just put it away somewhere, like in I don't know in the back of my closet so to keep it away from thieves.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Can you be honest with me real quick? - Mm-hmm.
How many times did you rub this thing and think a genie was gonna come out? I ain't gonna lie to you man.
I rubbed it, like, three times.
Yeah.
I thought so.
You know, I'm not If a genie did come out, what would you wish for? - More candelabras.
Yeah, I bet.
That is how you have sex, America.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's happening here is amazing.
Like, I want to film it, but I don't want to film it 'cause that would be p*rn.
And that time, I think I figured out what that thing underneath the thing was.
Yeah, you did.
And whoa, right? Yeah, whoa.
Hey, should we take a break and, like, talk about our childhoods or something? You know, get in there, get into it, get into each other's heads.
Dreams, thoughts, fears, feelings.
If Yeah I mean No? I'm gonna throw a curveball.
I'm gonna go banana it and then I'll be ready for round two.
Define "banana it.
" Eat a banana? Oh, good.
I was worried for a second.
What are Nick and Jess doing in there, and how is it this loud? Nick's body is so soft, it should absorb sound.
They're just getting warmed up, Schmidt.
It's a whole new ball game around here.
You, see, you wouldn't know that 'cause you haven't been here in weeks, but now that you're single, yeah, you got to deal with this, too.
Dumped by two women in the same day, Schmidt, that has got to be a record, man.
I get it, all right? I lost two perfect women, but I'm fine with it, all right? I'm fine.
You could've been perfectly happy with either one of them, - but now you're by yourself.
Winston, I'm fine.
Please.
That really has to hurt.
This is my home, too.
I shouldn't have to be faced with their stupid, happy relationship everywhere I look.
This is going to stop, Winston, and I'm gonna stop it.
Well, my advice to you is to stay in your foxhole, keep your head down and invest in one of these babies.
Watch your butt, Furguson.
This is my survival kit.
Check this out, man.
Blindfold.
Get this bell wrapped around my neck so he can hear when I'm coming.
Every couple has a weakness.
Kate and Will, I could break them up with one e-mail.
Oh, look at that, look at the royal baby now, - living with slutty Aunt Pippa.
I'm telling you, they're bulletproof.
Um, I have to show Nick something in the bathroom.
Yeah, it's tiles.
I'm so bad at lying.
It's for sex.
Oh, go! Go make love in our communal shower.
Enjoy it now, you little bunnies.
What? Want to see a magic trick? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess I like your chewing face.
It's just food.
Yeah, that's all it is, okay, people? I know it's super annoying to be around a couple.
Not me at all.
It's him.
Who? Oh.
Look at him.
Yeah, we had a tough day today at the V-E-T.
Yeah, they said he's gonna have to get It rhymes with "fleutered.
" The word is neutered.
Cats don't speak English.
Furguson's never gonna experience actual, physical lovemaking.
Do you think you're a little too into your cat? He should be out there, just getting all crazy, getting his freak on.
I feel bad, man.
I don't know what to do.
Let's try to help.
We got three smart people here.
We all know we got to get Furguson laid, right? Cat bachelor party.
That's right.
What do you think? Yeah, get some little cat strippers.
Big booty cats, little booty cats.
Some tabbies.
Some black ones, some white ones.
Yeah.
We'll mix it up.
Get us a couple Siamese, get weird with it.
Get him laid? - You know we're kidding? Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Gotcha.
It's happening.
Oh, look, it's you and you.
Is that a cake? Why do you have a sheet cake? Don't eat the cake, Jess.
What is that? Like, vanilla and vanilla? I just wanted to wish you guys a happy one-month anniversary.
Hip hip.
You said you wanted to break us up.
You said you didn't care if it took your whole life.
Look, I understand that I'm not exactly your favorite person right now, but I didn't want a milestone in your relationship like this to-to go uncelebrated.
You're really great together.
I don't trust him.
I know.
It's Schmidt we're talking about.
After he saw the movie Titanic, he started the Billy Zane fan club.
What? - Look it up.
They're called the Zaniacs.
Why does that make me angrier than anything he's ever done? - I will handle this.
Okay.
And I'm gonna test this cake because I'm so mad at Schmidt.
Hey, dummy, why'd you get us that cake? Come on, man, I'm just happy for you.
Looking at a-a month? A big month, man.
How many relationships have you had that have lasted more than a month? I don't know, some.
Probably very few, probably very, very few, right? I mean, you think it's less than two? One, it's Caroline, you know.
One? Are you kidding me, man? It's insane.
That's so few, but I guess you only need one, right, the one.
Too soon? - I'm really happy, Schmidt.
You should be, man.
Look at you.
You're like a different guy.
Usually at this point, you're overthinking and anxious and panicky and overthinking and overthinking and distant and nervous and sweaty and overthinking.
You're trying to get in my head, and it's not gonna work.
Who could, man? Look at you.
You're cool as a cucumber.
You're Obama on the ski slopes.
Now, get out there.
Enjoy that cake with the woman that you love.
Too soon? Forget about it.
Good talk.
Yeah.
What's wrong? Nothing.
Uh-oh.
Looks like we have a little Groundhog Day situation.
Please don't call it a Groundhog's Day situation.
Six more weeks of winter.
Don't worry.
Lie back.
I'm gonna take care of this.
This has never happened in my whole life, just so you know.
It's cool.
What can I do to help? I don't know, maybe think outside of the box? A little chicken kabob with rice.
Choice of naan or chutney.
How about we - Shh! Oh, I had it.
Reverse psychology.
I'm not attracted to you.
I don't think you're sexy.
Don't want to have sex with you.
Okay.
I think you're a fat, fat, fatty, fat - Okay! Oh, yeah.
Papa Smurf? Really? Whole body.
Are you sure? - Yes, hey.
Okay.
This will work, let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, at least the sun managed to get up.
I have to go move my car.
I'm kidding.
But I'm kidding! Are we not kidding about this? Does she have all her sh*ts? - Yep.
Okay, cool, cool.
Um, let me ask you this.
Uh, does she strike you as, um, I don't know, slutty? Excuse me, I'm here to pick up Fatty from her grooming.
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
Who are you here to pick up? - Well, actually, uh, my boy cat is looking for a girl cat.
Oh.
Well, I might know a girl cat who's looking for a boy cat.
Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.
Does the girl cat have all her parts? - Um, yeah.
Yes? Uh, okay.
Well, um, I don't know, maybe, uh, she could come over sometime? Like, our cats could go on a date? Yes, you get it.
You know, everyone else thought I was being weird.
So, um, how often do you groom your cat? So I talked to my mom about it, - and my dad - I've got to go move my car.
Hey, no, it's important we talk about these things.
Nick, it's - I'm moving my car! Hello.
Whew, Nick looks exhausted.
You guys obviously had a good night.
Yeah, um, I We didn't sleep much.
Well, of course you didn't, you mangy little stray.
I really don't want to talk about it, - especially not with you, Schmidt.
I know, and look, I also realize that it's gonna be a long time for me to regain your trust.
I just think it's sad because if you did have a Nick problem, I probably could help you out.
You know, my diploma says that I majored in communications, but my heart says that I majored in Nicholas studies.
I'm just saying.
I love the morning.
Anything's possible.
The whole day's ahead of you, you know? Last night, Nick struggled with impotence.
Oh, my God, I'm not talking you about this.
Jess, look, I get it.
You don't want my help, but just do me a favor please.
Let me know when you're not mad at me anymore so I can tell you about how men crave danger and variety in their sexual lives.
I just hope it's not too late, fingers crossed.
What are you talking about? I mean, I don't care, but if I did theoretically.
Theoretically, I would tell you for-for a man whose midsection is basically mush, Nick has had a lot of sex.
He's pushed that mush all over town.
And you know what, he's got some very weird taste.
Dark, real fringe stuff.
He likes stuff that they don't even have p*rn for.
And you know, a lot of women wouldn't think to do the Captain - in-in bed.
What? That was a mistake.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I didn't want to talk about the Captain.
It was a thing, and I did and Do you want a smoothie? What's the Captain? Well, it starts off with But you want to clean yourself up immediately.
I mean immediately.
And then you How comfortable are you with racial slurs? Then you That's basically it.
That's what Nick wants in bed? Yeah, I know.
Look, you're probably not up for it.
It's my It's my fault.
It's very degrading, it's offensive, and you, you just don't have the time to learn all those dolphin sounds.
Are you sure you don't want some of this smoothie? It's straw-bana.
Okay, Furguson, this is a big moment in your life.
All right, just be yourself, you dawg.
Winston, I think I found a way to You want to try some catnip? This is a real bummer.
Ahoy, Nicholas.
Wait, I'm scared! - Hey.
Hey.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Oh, thanks.
Let's, um, let's head to my room.
Oh, you're not wasting any time.
You know, it's just that I have very judgy roommates, you know, that might get a little weirded out if they walked in the room and saw something they weren't supposed to see.
Oh.
Or it's whatever, whatever Fatty wants.
What do you want, Fatty? Fatty wants to see your room.
That's awesome.
Great news.
You hear that, Furguson? - Y'all go play.
Yeah? There you go.
He was nervous.
Well, good thing I brought this.
Yeah, we can't give wine to these cats.
It's been a tough six months, and this cat needs a drink so O-Okay.
I don't think they care.
They're not listening at all.
Mm-mm.
They're too into each other.
Yeah.
Nick, we have to talk about this, okay? All right, I'll go first.
Listen I was uncomfortable with some of the specifics of what we just did.
For example, when I said, "You like that, huh?" I felt like you really, really didn't like it.
How do you feel? I just I feel like, you know No, it's just kind of like be I mean Uh It was good, you know.
It's over.
Love sleeping birdsty.
I just want to know what I did wrong.
How does the Captain normally go?
The what?
The Captain.
What we just did.
I've never done that in my life.
We did that because you wanted to, Jess.
What?! Why would I want to do that? That's degrading to not only women but all of mankind, Nick.
I know.
I only did that 'cause Schmidt told me it was your favorite thing Did you say, 'cause Schmidt said? No, no, no, no.
Did you just Did you talk to tight pants and eyebrows Who was I supposed to talk to, Nick? Every time I tried to talk to you about your penis problems, you went to move your car.
Those aren't penis problems.
What is Did you talk to Winston about my penis problems? - What about Cece, did she get a call? - He wasn't around.
Schmidt told me he had a PhD in Nickology.
He doesn't.
There's no such We have to talk about our feelings 'cause we're together.
If we needed to talk about feelings, they would be called "talkings."
No, that is not true.
Nick - That is 100% - This is it This is Schmidt getting in our heads.
I'm going to k*ll him! - Jessica, wait.
Schmidt! I can't run that fast The Captain! I trusted you.
You took advantage of me.
Something wrong? - You set us up.
I've done things to Nick I can't ever undo.
You see, your fatal flaw Communication.
You won't shut up about your feelings, and the only thing this dummy wants to talk about is the Chicago Brown Bears.
It's just the Chicago Bears.
There's no brown Who cares? I put a pebble in your path and the two of you cracked your tiny little skulls on it.
Ooh, by the way, how was the Captain? Did you make it all the way to the spyglass? Yes, Schmidt! And my night vision's very good 'cause my eyes are so buggy and big and I saw everything and I can't erase it from my memory.
Please, Jess, stop talking about the Captain.
Why don't we just go back to being roommates.
Okay? Nick, what do you say? The floor is yours.
You want to tell us how you feel? - Me? - Yeah.
Well I think it's I just Beautifully said.
Thank you, Nick.
Enjoy your breakup.
If you need me, I'll be in my room listening to mainstream hip-hop.
Stop! I have feelings.
I didn't like when you did the Captain.
It made me feel bad.
Okay, I've I've never seen this sober before.
Stop, it's my turn.
You talk too much and it frustrates me.
Sometimes you talk even after you've fallen asleep.
How do you breathe? Where do you get the words? But it doesn't matter, Jess, because I like you a lot.
But maybe do that less, okay? Nick, I just feel Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Just keep going.
I don't know.
Um I really like the instrument of the cello.
I like the cell a lot, and I don't talk about it a lot but I should because I feel very passionate about it.
It's a beautiful instrument.
It's like a guitar but it stands up.
I once saw a zebra named Gavin give birth at the zoo, and I cried hysterically.
And then I bought one of those stretched out pennies that you can get to remember it and then I lost that and I cried again.
Sometimes when I smell dust in like an attic or something, like that mothy, dusty, I think about my mother.
When I was 14, I saw my mother change, and I saw her whole body naked without underpants on.
I really like when a rap song uses a choir.
It makes me feel really happy when all those ladies' voices come in and then the guy's rapping.
I think it's awesome.
I'm really proud of you, Nick.
I really like.
I like you, too.
And it's been a month and I'm not scared.
Unless you're doing the Captain, and then I experience very real fear and it's very visceral Just kiss me.
No kissing in the living room! No.
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Cease lovemaking! All lovemaking must cease.
Get out of here, Schmidt! - Break up! - Just break up already, pl - Oh, forget it.
I'm just I'm-I'm - Hey, no, no.
What are you doing? Oh, my God, he just h*t my sack.
Body block! I'm pure core.
I've been training for this.
Yeah, human dental dam.
So What do you do for fun? Huh? Oh, um You know, like all good things.
Like what? Tell me one thing.
I'm sorry, do you hear noise? - Oh - Do you hear shouting? - 'Cause I'm just - Yeah.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Who the hell mess up the mood?! - Schmidt, Schmidt.
Hey.
Put down my condoms.
Pull it together, Schmidt.
It's raining celibacy.
Hallelujah.
You're losing it, man.
If I'm not having sex in this loft, nobody's having sex in this loft.
Hyah! Oh, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Oh, my birth control pills.
You don't want to do this, my man.
Yes, I do want to do this.
It's the only way to get this place back to the way that it was.
Put them down.
Give them to me.
Give them to Jess.
Come on, buddy, it's not worth it.
No fear! - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just throw them in the sink, you idiot.
You better pray that was a placebo week.
Is he eating birth control pills? Friday! Full wheel, bitches! I win.
I don't feel good.
Guys, come on, our cats were just about to have sex.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this whole time I thought What? Fatty, come on.
We're out of here.
So, what do you guys think, loft meeting in 20? Yeah, I'll be there in 15.
Got to stick my head in a paper bag and scream at the top of my lungs.
Oh, yeah, there'll be no snacks.
Schmidt, I just looked it up.
There's no way estrogen works that fast.
You don't know my body.
Please, stop talking about your body.
Okay, that's a good segue to some of the more relevant topics that I would like to cover in this meeting.
Like, uh, personal space.
Public space.
Other people's medicines Taking them versus not taking them.
I am so aware of my nipples right now.
Okay, that's a good start.
If someone were to blow on my nipples, I would positively scream.
Boundaries.
Any takers? All right, we live here.
Where are we supposed to go? This is my fault.
'Cause I'm going through a sexual awakening.
It's like I'm tapping into this raw sexual energy that the universe is putting forth.
And it's just both imploding and exploding at the same time.
And it's kind of like I'm a young nun.
And Nick is my sexy monseigneur.
And I'm a I'm just going to shut up.
Both of you need to shut up, okay? You're having sex, not inventing.
It can't be that good.
It's good.
Stop saying, "Squeeze my biscuits.
" - I'm serious, Nick.
Sorry.
And, Schmidt, stop taking it out on everybody else, man.
Deal with your breakups.
Ain't no way in hell I got a cat brothel going on in my room and I'm the only normal person in this loft.
You did a bad thing.
Deal with it.
What's that? Oh, it's just what I needed.
This gum is crap.
You ready? What is it? Just keep your eyes closed.
All right, stand right there, okay? - Okay.
Turn around.
I love it.
Yeah.
I don't I don't know what it is.
All right, then yell something.
I soundproofed it.
What's wrong? I just heard yelling.
Get out of here, man.
He must He must've literally been right by the door.
It is soundproofed That's what the egg crates are for, so Nick, I just want to say something.
Um This last month has been the best month of my life.
Me, too.
I've never, you know, felt this way or had this with anybody.
It's like there's been this fog around my life, and with you, all of a sudden it's gone.
I love that you can express your feelings now.
Yeah, it's a weird feeling.
It's kind of like gross but also good.
You know? It's like an egg broke.
And then, like, all the yolk comes out but it's good.
I'm happy to admit I like love songs.
I understand them.
They're really sad.
They're mostly about either the girl or the guy got away.
They're heartbreaking numbers.
The air Do you feel it? I guess this is the air you breathe, but it's nice.
I feel like I'm on this whole new planet.
How about your two favorite planets? Oh, yeah, those are great.
But I also feel like being with you, I've finally, for the first time, and I know this sounds crazy, but I can see the stars.
You know, the other great thing about talking about our feelings is we don't need to do it all the time.
Thank you for expressing that.
I feel like I can see you - Uh-huh.
in 3-D vision.
Everyone see in 3-D.
Hmm.
So, would you like to take my bra off, or should I? See, I feel excited to take your bra off.
So, do it.
I love your breasts.
Just mixing it up with those two things.
I'm not even nervous to do it.
So, do it.
I feel excited to Okay, right now.
Let's do this.
Hey, Elizabeth, what are we doing tonight? Dexter and pie.
Girl, you treat me right.
Hey, there she is, my one and only.
Oh, thank God, coffee.
I barely slept last night.
Yeah, me, too.
I think I passed out for, like, 25 minutes when you jammed that sock down my throat.
I aim to please.
Aw Hey, why don't we all go on a double date? What are you guys doing tonight? Yeah.
Tonight? - Yeah.
Today's tonight? - Yeah.
Tonight meaning changes every day, doesn't it? Come on, Schmidt.
I'm sure he's got other plans.
You've got other plans, right? Plans? Not me.
I don't even I mean Yeah! What the hell is going on? What? Double-double-double-double date! Rock, rock and roll.
I don't think I exactly understand the energy here, but yeah, I mean, it sounds great.
Hey, you want to split that pasta from last night, hmm? Winston and Furguson 'bout to split some pasta.
Yeah, man, you know I got "wuv" for you.
Got nothing but love for you.
Go ahead, chill out, man, I'll make you some coffee.
What? So what are y'all talking about, going on dates? Oh, y'all are talking about that.
Okay, cool.
Nobody invited me.
Is it 'cause I'm single? I mean, I I know I'm single.
I'm okay with it.
It was a choice that I made as a man to be alone.
Don't nobody know you like you, so I'm I'm choosing to know myself, who I am.
And if that's okay with you all, can I come? All right, where should we go tonight, you guys? What about that new spot Picca? A day-of rezzie at Picca? You guys don't think I can do it, huh? Well, funk that.
Bishop can get a table at a chair store.
Well, that's it, then.
Double date plus one! You know what would be nuts? If I brought my cat Furguson as a date.
Ah, don't do that.
Hey, listen.
What is that sound? Sounds like a gravel driveway in there.
Seventh grade.
Pumping my fist too hard at a Weird Al show.
Go away! Hey, Jess, can you talk? Oh.
Yeah, yeah, totally.
How'd I get so lucky? My bro and my ho.
My penis it's gonna be exposed.
It's okay, just cover up.
Okay, no, but I don't feel comfortable.
It's about Schmidt.
Okay, I'm not involved in this at all.
Hiding from the world.
You can't see me, I can't see you.
I know this sounds totally paranoid, but I think he's on drugs.
Schmidt on drugs? Okay, not getting involved starting now.
I'm with Nick here.
You remember how hard he took it when Lance got busted.
He just stared at that yellow bracelet and cried.
I know you're right, but - You're coming in? - It's just like he's had this crazy energy lately.
And did you see how insane he was when we were talking about the double date? Also, he has just, like, stopped blinking.
Is that whippits? - Well, Nick can talk to him.
No, I'm not gonna talk to him.
I called that I wasn't gonna be involved; those calls have to be respected.
If you talk to him, I'll give you a treat.
Bedroom treat or kitchen treat? Oh, I'm just a country lawyer and I have a very, very itchy bra.
Well, perhaps I can get underneath.
I've got worker's hands.
It's very itchy in so many different little places.
Let me see.
You guys are being really, really gross right now.
I keep forgetting you're in here.
I think you made a really good point.
Maybe he is just, like, really into me.
I mean, he has, like, stepped up his bed game a lot.
It is so not about him anymore.
That's disgusting.
Let me know when that treat's gonna happen.
And, Cece, I'm sorry about this, but I'm gonna stand up and you're gonna see my penis, and when I walk out, you're gonna see my butt.
Let's do this.
Oh.
Ah, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Sorry.
Yeah, so that's glass.
That ain't no mint.
Nope.
Definitely glass, and I swallowed that, so you should consider, uh, a sign.
Do you have a reservation? - You know, it's funny that you would ask that because, you know, I tried to call, like, but, uh, I'm looking for a reservation for tonight around 8:00 p.
m.
Let's say, like, five people.
I have an 8:30.
Ah, kind of had our heart set on 8:00.
Seven weeks from now.
Wait, what, what? No, n-n-n-n-no.
Look, there's got to be something that you can do.
Well, you could try your luck at the community table.
Community hell, no.
Listen, um, sorry, you don't understand.
This has to be an official reservation.
No.
I'll tell you what, maybe this will change your mind.
"I owe you a hundred dollars.
" Oh, hell no.
No, that that was supposed to be a ten.
Whoa, you got there faster than I thought.
Hey, so this is weird and it's only gonna take a second of your time, but, uh and I probably already know the answer, but are you on drugs? I know the answer is no, so I'll just see you later, man.
Get in my room.
Don't want to be part of it! Did you cr*ck my e-mail password? How did you guess "Smithereens"? Are you really on drugs? Talk to me, Schmidt.
I'm in way over my head, Nick, I'm doing something terrible.
Well, what is it, man? You're going to get mad at me.
I'm your best friend.
Okay, I was there for you when you fell off the deck at Chester's graduation.
Oh, no.
And I'm here for you now.
There's nothing you could say that I'd get mad at.
O okay, um, I can do this.
Do you know how I broke up with Elizabeth so that I could start dating Cece again? Absolutely, and it was really hard for you.
Yeah, that actually never happened.
What do you mean? I'm still dating Elizabeth.
What do you mean? I'm dating both of them, and neither one of them knows it, and I feel terrible about it.
But Elizabeth is gone.
What do you mean? - She's not gone.
So you broke up with Cece - I didn't break up with either one of them.
What do you mean? You process this however you need to process it.
If you want to keep talking it out - Which one are you dating? - Both.
Are you dating Cece? - I'm dating Cece.
Are you dating Elizabeth? - Yes.
How do you do that? - They made me choose.
You have to choose.
You can't have both women.
What was I supposed to do? What, you think you can have a bunch of wives?! You got one wife! This is the way the world works! - Why?! - I don't know.
I feel terrible about this, I don't know what to do.
How could you do this with Jess's best friend? I don't know, I feel really badly about it! In your little brain, how do you see this ending? I see it ending badly.
I see it ending very, very badly.
But you know what? I just I want to thank you, though, just for being there for me and for listening to me.
No.
I'm not listening to you and I'm not there for you.
Because now we're in this together.
We're not in this together and I'm not listening and I'm not being there, so just stop telling me things! What would you like me to do with this information? Well, it really helped me to tell you.
You should tell somebody, get it off your chest.
I can't.
You know what I mean? - Like who? Well, certainly not Jess.
Don't ever tell Jess.
The one person you can't tell is Jess.
Hello, Picca? Yes, I need a table for five.
This is author Toni Morrison.
I am? Well, oh, yeah? Well, I think you're a woman! Hello? Okay, here's what it is.
Just lie to her, Nick.
It's a relationship men and women lie to each other all the time; it's what makes marriages work.
Just lie Oh, you can lie Yes, I talked to Schmidt.
Don't act like an alien; just lie to a woman.
It's Yeah, I talked to Schmidt.
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
Hey, Nick.
How was your day? Nothing Why are you wearing a helmet? Oh, hi.
Don't tease me, Nick.
Are we finally gonna do no-kiss sex? Oh, yes.
Sorry about that.
Look at us.
Community table, like a little community.
Call that seat.
That's my seat.
Come on.
Yeah.
Oh, no, where are y'all going? Dibs on those seats, dibs on that.
Put that for me right there.
Hey, put that right there for me.
That was amazing.
Jess, you know so many Spaceballs quotes.
They jam the radar with literal jam.
Oh, hey, did you ever talk to Schmidt? What's going on, Nick? Schmidt! Hey! My best friend?! You Long Island street trash! Damn it, Nick, you told her? No, he didn't tell me! I I happened upon it.
Oh, you happened upon it? Where, in the town square? Jess, I never wanted to be involved in this.
You're so pretty.
Put your freakin' visor down.
Now, you you're gonna tell Cece or I will, you you crumb bum! - Jess - You crumb bum.
Yes, well said.
You are a lowlife.
I I get it.
How could you do this to her? - Jess, I am so sorry.
I made up a dance so everyone will be happy.
Cece's gonna walk through that door any minute, and you have to tell her the truth.
Jess, please, this would wreck her.
I'm begging you.
I I know you don't believe me, but I do care about her.
Either you tell her or I will, Schmidt.
You're right.
I'll tell her.
Yo, what it be? Double date night! What's, uh, what's going on? Tell her.
Tell her.
Okay, okay.
We're taking two cars.
It's faster that way because of gas.
No phones.
What? Here you go; I got the door, it's okay.
Go! Go! Cigarette, phone call, bathroom.
Okay.
Sir, you're clearly alone.
We're gonna need this table.
Okay, so what do you think that over the past two hours, I, as a single person, have ordered eight separate entrees and have taken bites of different sizes of each of them to create some sort of pointless illusion? Do you know how insane you sound? God, I hate this job.
You need to slow down.
I got it.
Don't worry.
What's going on, man? You guys were acting all so weird back there, - and you're driving like a maniac.
Oh, geez.
You know, I didn't want to have to say anything, but What? Here we go.
Nick is cheating on Jess! Aah! - What?! Apparently, they met at some gas station.
She's much older.
Much, much older.
Deeply Korean.
I just found out.
And, I mean, Nick is my best friend and all, but I can't even be in the same room as that scumbag right now! Oh, I'm so mad! I'm just so, so mad! I'm terribly angry about the whole situation.
I can't even drive.
Take the wheel.
Oh, why, God?! He was the best of us! - Cece, please.
You're veering everywhere.
Sorry.
Oh, Nick, go, go! We're gonna lose them! You keep nerd-stopping at every sign! Look, if I get another ticket, they're gonna make me wear eyeglasses.
Why didn't you get involved back there? Look, look, here's the reality.
Yes, Schmidt is my best friend, and he's also really scary.
You are so afraid of everything.
Oh, really? Would a man afraid of everything - put his finger in a cigarette lighter? - I don't know Don't do that.
That's just stupid! - I'm not gonna do that.
You wimp.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! - Jess, are you okay? - It really hurts.
Oh, my Lord, are - It's so hot! - Come here.
Are you okay? - Yeah.
Are you okay? Look, I'm gonna do it.
Ow! Oh.
Why did you do that? So that we were both in the same amount of pain! I'm gonna junk-punch him.
Turn the car around.
We're going to the restaurant.
Why would you ? That seems rash.
Maybe I don't know.
Maybe staying away for a while, or at least I don't know talking about it, hearing his side.
I don't Cheating is selfish, and it is cowardly, and there is no excuse for it.
The only thing that you can do is punch it in the junk.
Or you could really understand it emotionally from their point of view.
You don't know.
Maybe they had a tough childhood.
Turn the car around, Schmidt.
Maybe their mom's a lesbian.
I don't know.
Turn the car around! Yeah, let's do it.
Let's turn the car around.
Let's go to Picca.
I'm gonna turn the car around as soon as I turn this Turn the car around Schmidt! - As soon as I turn the car around.
Now! As soon as I turn this car around Turn the car around, Schmidt! Let's go! And I'm turning the car around.
Let's do it.
Here we come.
What is he doing? - I don't know.
Looks like he lost a wing.
Hey, Jess.
Yeah, fourth message.
Just a friendly time update.
guys aren't bailing on me, or maybe you just lost track of time being couples! h*t me back.
Winnie the Bish.
We're never gonna find this restaurant; maybe we should just go home.
There it is! - Here it is.
Welcome! - Can I have your car, sir? - Oh.
Sir? Sir? Sir? I'm on the phone.
All right, time's up.
You got to get out of here.
Uh, th that's my friend.
That's my friend.
See? See? I told you all.
Huh? I got friends.
Everybody? Hmm? That's my friend right there.
Where the hell is Nick?! How did I even b*at him here?! - That was the slowest ride of my entire life! - Oh, Jess Literally, my grandmother drives faster than that.
Look, she's my best friend.
Yeah.
And Schmidt is mine.
That's why I didn't want to get involved.
Well, when someone I love gets hurt, I get involved.
Sir? What's up, big cat? Sir? Sir? Well, you got to go in there, and you got to face her.
Look, it's not about Cece.
This is about the $12 valet.
It's $12 to ? One sec.
Hey, it's self-park! The maroon car is self-park! It's an excessive amount of money.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Look, I know you didn't, okay? But now it's time you do the right thing, Schmidt.
I can't go in there.
Well, I can't let Jess tell her.
Hello? Open the door.
Wait, Cece! - Oh, Jess, I have something to tell you.
I have something to tell you! What? No, I have something I need to tell you.
Oh, my God, what are you doing, Cece?! Why did you do that?! Cece.
You nipped the corner! Wait, Cece.
Uh okay.
I Cece, he's not I lied to you.
I I've been cheating on on you with Elizabeth.
Uh, I hate to do this right now, but if we don't sit, we will lose this table.
Cece, I'm sor I'm sorry.
I don't I just Is there someplace maybe we could, uh, go talk? Everybody knows anyway, Schmidt.
Might as well just say it.
Oh, let's talk.
Let's we this should be fine.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You have to know that I did not want to hurt you.
Please, I I'm begging you.
If you take anything away from this, know that I did not want to hurt you.
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
Especially you.
You have no idea what you mean to me.
And I got caught up in this thing, and I used to be so fat.
I mean, like truly gigantic.
I mean, as big as as big as big as it gets.
And now and now I'm not, and girls like me, and I don't I don't know how to do this.
I got lost.
And I'm sorry.
You're sorry? You didn't want to hurt anybody? That's the best you can do, Schmidt? Really? I don't know.
I don't know you.
Good-bye, Schmidt.
I'm just realizing that I don't have any cash on me.
If anyone would be willing to loan me $12 for the valet, that would be greatly appreciated.
Cece still hasn't called me.
Do you think you could test my phone again? I can't.
I don't have any more minutes.
Minutes, Nick?! Who still has minutes on their phone?! I bought 10,000 minutes in I'm sorry.
I just I I really want to be there for her.
You are, okay? And she'll call, 'cause she needs you.
Hell.
This is a real butt munch of a situation we're in.
Yeah.
Look I'm here for you.
There is nothing I know more than the fact that I want to be with you, Jess, okay? Unless we're driving.
You admitted to driving while legally blind! No, because you're honestly the worst backseat You're honestly telling me what to do the entire time! - Legally blind.
Whoever has the wheel controls the car! You liar! Here's your pie! You broke my heart.
Mail me my mouth guard.
In case you were wondering if Cece had Elizabeth's number, sh she does.
So, tough time in Schmidtsburg, wouldn't you say? Just a quick heads-up, Nick, Jess.
I blame you for this whole thing.
You can't seriously - I was going to fix it.
I wasn't going to hurt anyone.
But, since you took it upon yourself to hurt both of them, should it take me the rest of my life, I'm going to break the two of you up.
Bring it, Schmidt.
It's impossible.
We're really strong.
It will be when you least expect it, which might be when you most expect it.
Could actually be when you're watching the movie version of What to Expect When You're Expecting.
Regardless I am coming for you.
Oh, my God, Schmidt is so scary.
You were right.
We have to talk about the things - that he could use to pull us apart, okay? - Okay.
Okay.
Okay, politics.
You're a Democrat, I've never voted.
I'm in the Green Party.
Oh, that is so annoying.
Okay, I have been banned for my lifetime from Lake Ontario.
Don't ask.
Okay.
What else do you have? - My fear of pears.
Okay, you're afraid of pears? And pear-shaped people.
Um, that's interesting.
I'm not convinced I know how to read.
I've just memorized a lot of words.
The doctors say I might grow another 18 inches.
That's a different image of you, but I'm gonna get past that, and I'm past it.
Okay, the moon landing - Uh, which is obviously fake.
No, it's not obviously fake.
No, that's actually not what - Are you crazy? The moon landing is definitely fake, by the way.
The moon landing's not - What?! The shadows are off.
No, they're not.
Yes, they are.
I've looked at photos on the Internet, and it proves it.
Nick, that's - The shadows are off, the shadows are off ! Shadows are not those photos are Photoshopped.
That's not true.
People do that as a joke - to trick stupid people.
Oh, yeah, you can just Photoshop - No, that's - Wait a minute.
He's doing it already.
He's getting in our heads.
Unbelievable.
Good call.
Okay, this is good.
Let's keep going.
I totally agree.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Okay.
I kind of want to get a g*n.
I'm definitely sexually attracted to Lady Bucks.
Ok.
I prefer the ***.
I think it's the best one.
I know that you're very into it - It's not.
Yes, it is.
He's very charming.
I'm weirdly good at volleyball.
I believe horses are from outer space.
I believe that too! - Ok.
Good.
So I've been thinking a lot about it, and I'd really like to start calling you "Shorty" in public.
By the way, my office is throwing a party tomorrow, and I would - I'd really like for you to be there.
Well, I have a photo sh**t, but I think I could come after that.
Oh, yeah, well, that sounds good.
Who's that? Hmm? It's my doctor.
Uh, D-Dr.
Cover.
Doc-Doctor Wyland Cover.
He's my oncologist.
He's an oncologist.
Hey, you guys know anything about cats? Yeah, I'm trying to score some points with Daisy, so I promised to watch her cat tonight.
They carry disease, they're obsessed with my nipples, and they are unwelcome in this loft.
Did you just say that cats are obsessed with your nipples? I've told you this story before.
I think I would have remembered that story.
No cats.
Come on, bangs, you sons of bitches.
Here, let me do 'em, Jess.
What? - Nick, Nick, stop.
What? - Stop, you're gonna ruin it.
I'm not gonna ruin I was I was making 'em look prettier.
No, you weren't.
Then they look perfect as is.
Can I ask you a question? Absolutely we having this thing right now? - Do I look okay? - Do you look okay? - Yeah.
Hell yeah! I want to put it on you.
On? Put it on me? Yeah, on I stand by that.
I'd like to put it on you.
What is wrong, Jess? I've been at this new school for a week now and I still haven't made any friends.
There's, like, a clique of teachers, and they run the school.
You keep bumpin' me against the wall Yeah, I know I let you slide before Hey, but until you seen me, trust me You ain't seen bouncin' back You keep bumpin' me against the wall I just want them to like me.
I know it sounds dumb, but Leave it to me.
I'll fix it.
You're Nick Miller's girl now.
You're my old lady.
What? - Whatever you need, you got it.
Why are you talking like a James Taylor song? I don't know.
Hey, either of you guys know anything about cats? Oh, my God, Schmidt has the greatest cat story! - Ugh, I was there it's disgusting.
You shut your damn mouth, Jess.
Thought it was cute Oh, grow up! Nothing came out.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess You know what? I've never actually seen you this happy.
Who are you? - I don't know, it's weird.
I've never seen you smile.
Ever.
This is the first time.
It's not bad.
I mean, it's not great.
Yeah, I agree.
Somewhere right in the middle.
Hey, can I ask you something? - Of course.
Hypothetically speaking, what if you met somebody that you that you liked, uh, just as much as Jess? Schmidt, stop.
Okay, you picked Cece, so let Elizabeth go.
Initially I said "hypothetically," so just Do you know a place I can get cheap school supplies? I only have $15 and a halfie $15 and a halfie.
A halfie? - Yeah, it's a half.
It got ripped, so it's a half.
No one's gonna accept that as currency.
Hey, what's up, guys? - Did you press the button? - I thought you pressed the button! What is wrong with you?! - What did you do when you walked in? - Talked to you.
Guys, I'm gonna go pick up Daisy's cat.
You know, you don't just ask anybody to take care of your cat.
That's a very serious thing, so I decided I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna ask Daisy to be my girlfriend.
You are? - Whoa! - Yeah.
Major move! - Good stuff.
Look at you, man.
So I'm just gonna go over there and I'm gonna tell Daisy, "Listen, my heart is a two-man bike, and I want you in the rear.
" What do you think? Winston, don't say that.
You want her in your? You can say "the rear.
" You don't want her in your rear.
No, don't say "the rear" at any time.
You guys are just jealous.
What? You guys are gonna steal my swag.
I wouldn't even know how to begin to steal a swag.
I thought you pressed the button.
I've been way over here.
I-I haven't pressed - I'll press the button.
Last night, I rectified our budget while taking a long soak in my new Jacooz.
My elbows are as soft as babies.
I love a soft elbow.
How about you bring that noise over here.
Good meeting.
Great, well Uh - Foster's such a dork.
He needs to get laid.
I got laid.
This morning.
From my boyfriend.
So coitus no-one-interruptus.
That because we finished, so Why are you talking to us? - You have owl eyes.
Yeah.

I'm fixing it for you.
And then she Yeah.

Teachers don't pay.
We'll think about it.
Okay, they'll think about it.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
That was genius.
It's a no-brainer.
Whoa, that's an amazing move, sex partner.
Sex part With the promotion, uh, I got a new office, so I don't have to look at Bethany's mismanaged eyebrows all day.
Do you like it? It's a perfect two-thirds replica of Don Draper's office from Mad Men, and you're my sexy Peggy.
Good God, at least shut the door.
My tiny credenza is in the way.
Hey, Elizabeth, are you gonna be coming to the party tomorrow night? Party? What party? The big office party.
Schmidt, did you not invite her? I was just about to invite you to go.
Cool, it's a date.
Bye, baby.
Bye.
Mwah, mwah.
How how dare you interfere with my personal life, you crone.
I don't I don't kick up a fuss when you massage yourself with your yoga ball.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you gonna invite Cece? Beth, please.
I am in love with both of these women.
Do I feel bad about lying to them? Yes.
I'm a Sagittarius.
Congrats on your new office.
Gina gave birth on that carpet.
Consider this closed.
Right, so, yeah, um Um, so, Daisy, what I was really trying to say is, uh Is your shower running? Yeah, I was just about to take a shower.
What's going on? - Okay.
Um, Daisy, I think what we have is real, and, uh, I want us to be exclusive just you and me in the rear.
Yeah, that sounds great.
Awesome, um Sorry, that's mine.
So, Furguson gets his wet food in the morning, dry food at night.
Somebody in there? No.
No treats after midnight.
"Oh, my name is Principal Foster, and this is the Jacooz.
" "The Jacooz.
" He's so nice, don't you think? He's such a nice boss.
Y'all want some drinks? - Yeah, okay.
Yep.
Yeah.
Thank, thank you.
Thank you.
What do you think? I think it's going really well.
Okay, I just realized what's happening.
It's high school over there, and they're the cool kids, and you're the nerd.
I was never a nerd.
On western wings the fowls doth fly On briny swells the fishes doth swim Oh, like you were so cool.
Stall! CROWD Nick! Nick! Nick! The Miller Sack Pack.
Miller Sack Pack? - They made shirts.
You know what? I'm not explaining my coolness to you.
I was cool.
Listen to me.
You want to be in with them? Roll with the punches, go with the flow.
Make fun of your boss a little bit.
Don't follow your instincts.
I wouldn't sing.
But most importantly, follow my lead.
And by "follow my lead," I mean drink.
And I mean drink a lot.
Drinking to be cool, Nick? That's not a real thing.
That's the only thing in the world I know to be true.
Schools are for fools! They are.
Sometimes firemen are women! Sometimes! Sometimes! Hey, there she is.
Ol' Toilet Pants, the girl who bet herself six dollars she could dance in a toilet bowl.
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah What's going on? I'm cool.
You are cool, but you still got to go to work, 'cause you're running late, so up and at 'em.
Hey, Nick, I got to talk to you.
I have a real problem.
Oh, my God.
Did you k*ll Jess? - No, no, no, no.
She just got really drunk last night, and she passed out.
Hey, guys.
Are you crying, buddy? - No.
Hey, did he k*ll Jess? No, I didn't k*ll Je Okay, remember when I was so hungover, I almost missed my flight for Christmas? Ah, count it down.
Three, two, one.
Two, one.
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar Soar - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
Oh, she's awake.
That was beautiful.
Where are my tights? Uh, in the bathroom where you barfed.
You sounded really good there, man.
Start the band.
What did you do to her? I just told her that I thought drinking would make her cool.
What are you, a 14-year-old hockey player? You're supposed to protect her, not encourage her.
Okay, I am protecting her.
She's my old lady now.
By turning her into you? - I'm not Yeah, Daisy cheating on me.
Wait, we're using real honey? So sticky.
Hey, babe! What a nice surprise! I came to tell you that you can't come with me to the party tonight.
They just told me that it's employees only.
No sig oths.
Just say "significant others.
" Maybe you have that kind of time, but I'm on a tight sched.
Looks like we're gonna go late here anyway, so no worries.
All right Shorty.
All right, bring in the bees! Oh, wait.
The bees are real, too? Oh, hell no! Nick, I need your help, okay? Now, I am no plumber, but I'm 99% sure that there was a guy in her bathroom.
So, she agreed to be exclusive with you while the guy she is obviously sleeping with was washing his size 15 ding-dong in the shower.
And now you're taking care of her cat.
Those are the b*llet points, yes.
You know what you got to do to get yourself out of this situation.
Break up with Daisy! Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, you're making some very good points.
You know, break up with Daisy.
That's an option.
I was thinking, like, I'll k*ll her cat.
Winston.
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna k*ll her cat first.
Hey.
I'm gonna k*ll you.
Hey, it's little Toilet Pants.
Hey, Toilet Pants! Toilet Pants! Please stop shouting.
You are so awesome.
I want to show you something.
Oh! Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
You're one of us now.
You never have to drink out of a paper cup again.
Fun mugs.
This one makes me look like I have a - mustache.
Mustache.
Mustache.
What's up, Winston?
Oh, hey, Nick.
You know, I couldn't figure out the best way to k*ll Furguson, so I decided to just let him choose how he wants to die.
If only I could get him to leave that damn sunbeam.
You're gonna m*rder a cat? - Yeah.
This is a joke, right? - No.
This is one of your pranks? - An eye for an eye, Nick.
A cat for a cat.
But what's the other cat? My heart.
Where's that big flashlight you can h*t people with? Also, do we have any meat pieces that might distract a dog? Winston, don't do anything stupid.
Jess, what are you doing? - Oh, yeah, yeah.
Cool, cool.
It's nothing.
We're just breaking into Foster's backyard, and we are gonna put our butts in his Jacuzzi.
You're gonna put your butts in his Jacuzzi? - Isn't it awesome? - Uh, no, it's not awesome.
It's a crime.
It's a very stupid crime, but it's a crime.
Hey, do you have any makeup or costumes that might make someone look like a bush? You are about to commit a felony.
Oh, my God, Nick! You said roll with it! You're not the kind of person who could break into the principal's house and get away with it.
You're the kind of person who gets caught, and it ends up on the Internet in a funny way.
My God! That is the cutest cat! Uh, don't get attached.
Okay, both of you, knock it off! Winston! Look, Nick, you're right.
I'm a nerd.
I've never fit in.
If I met you in high school, you never would have even noticed me.
That's just because I didn't go to class.
I wouldn't have seen you.
I know it's stupid, but I'm doing it.
I'm not letting you go.
Oh, you're not letting me? No.
If for some reason I don't come back tonight, I'll be at the Appleton Suites under the name Suzuki Sinclair.
Ask for Charles.
Don't Hey, hey.
We're not done with this conversation, young lady! - Well, we are done! - Oh, yeah, then where are you going?! - I'm getting a flashlight! - Oh, a hammer, huh? - Hey, Winston, Winston.
Good way to go.
Thr - Don't hurt that cat.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Furguson? Furguson? - You scared him.
Don't do this.
Furguson? - Winston! Winston, Winston, stop what you Stop! Don't do that scary walk! Do not do that scary walk that you do that scares me! Hey, Jess? Jess? Je? Winston, don't k*ll that! Jess! I don't know what to do! - Oh, good Lord.
What's wrong? Nothing.
You know what? Let me show you the stairwell where they got the idea for the escalator.
Shorty! My love.
My only love.
I'm sorry.
I just I quit that job, and I had to see you.
How emotional.
Let's go talk about it in private in a perfect two-thirds replica of Don Draper's office.
You stay here.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
No, no, no, please, you-you you stay here.
So - Oh, God, what? They're both here.
The gas has been spilled.
All we need is a match.
What, are you narrating a book? Here it comes.
The long nap.
Oh, wow.
Tell you what, man, we both need to just cool off and have a drink.
You smoke? I'm just kidding.
But, man, that'd be cute if you did.
What is wrong with me? It Oh, Furguson.
So, listen, I've been dreaming about this fantasy, and I think this party might be the perfect place to try it out.
Okay, but I can't get wet.
No water.
So, listen, you and I are gonna be sexy strangers.
Yeah? Now, your stranger is the early-to-bed type, and your job has you on Hong Kong time.
But the most important thing is, you're the first person to leave the party.
Whew.
I like.
Wait, is that Cece? - Is that who? Huh? No.
Cece.
No.
No, Schmidt, that's definitely Cece.
Sorry, in between modeling jobs, she does catering.
You mind if I go over there and say hello? I think it's only right.
Eh.
Hey.
Hey, I know you told me to stay in the office, but Beth insisted that I Stay away from that woman.
She is patient zero in this office for spreading HPV.
Here.
Put on this apron.
No, why-why would I do that? That's crazy.
My boss was asking, so I told her you were a caterer.
So just It's a good idea.
Okay.
Just Yes.
You really want me here, don't you? So badly.
Can we just come back when we have a plan? Are you afraid? No, I'm not afraid.
Rose, give me a boost.
Here's Rose.
I got you.
Oh, my Oh, my God.
You got to help me a little.
That's a hell of a grip, Rose.
I see the Jacuzzi! Didn't stick the landing! You're doing great.
I'm gonna do a loop to not attract suspicion.
All right.
All right.
Schmidt.
I'm right here.
Oh.
Do I know you? Right.
The fantasy.
Boy, I got to go.
I have a 5:00 a.
m.
conference call with the Asians.
Are you leaving soon, stranger? You mean "Corporal"? And, no, I'm gonna stick around and throw down one more beer.
Sweet.
Oh, hey.
Don't tell me you're leaving.
Whew, great news.
My boss is in her office completely passed out.
We finally have the night to ourselves.
Thank God.
It's getting a little weird here, right? Dressed up like this.
That Elizabeth? Okay, look, Cece, I-I got to tell you something.
Does Elizabeth work here? Yes.
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
The food was good.
Yeah.
I was thinking of taking some home.
You deserve it.
Okay, well, I'm heading off.
The Asian markets wait for no one.
Wow.
She was ice cold to you.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
What a night.
I got this! - Open the damn gate! - Everything's under control! - Jess, hey! Don't move! I'm coming over! Rose, move! Jess, hey.
I'm coming.
I got you.
Whoa, hey, Rose! Ease up on the throttle.
Those are my precious goods.
Did you follow me here? Here I come! - Nick.
Hey.
Hey, Jess.
Jess, hey.
You okay? - Yeah.
I'm sorry I tried to stick my nose in this.
I just I just I came here because I'm your old man now.
And if you're gonna do something that's obviously very stupid then I'm gonna do it with you.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
You go there.
Ow.
What's going on out here? - Hey.
Who are you? - No, I-I used to live here.
I was just doing a visit around the neighborhood.
That's my old bedroom right there.
That's a bathroom.
To you maybe it is.
But to me and my four brothers, - that's a home.
Nick.
Nick, I can't let you do this.
Mostly 'cause you're so bad at it.
Is that you, Ms.
Day? - Yes.
It is.
I'm so sorry.
I trespassed on your property.
And I would not be surprised if you fired me.
I think I know what's really going on here.
You heard about my new Jacooz.
And you wanted a taste.
And say a little prayer for right You know that if we are to stay alive Come on in, kids.
The water's hot! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo Hey, babe.
Thanks for watching him.
He can be a real pain in the ass, huh? Yeah Was there a dude in your shower yesterday? Yes.
Hmm.
How do you know him? From sex.
But it was from sex before you and I were exclusive.
Have you had sex with him since? No.
Oh, wait.
Yes.
Last night.
Look, um I really liked you, Daisy.
You know, I wanted this to be a thing, but, uh I deserve better.
And so does Furguson.
Hmm? I'm keeping the cat.
I got your cat! Well, Schmidt, you win.
They both really love you.
So enjoy your office.
Hey! Toilet Pants! - Oh! Toilet Pants! Thanks for taking the b*llet for us the other night.
How long were you stuck in that Jacuzzi for? I don't really want to talk about it, but, um, at one point, he did grab my foot with his toes like it was a hand.
What are you doing tonight? 'Cause we got a liquid form of Ecstasy, and we're gonna grade papers together.
What? I would love to, but I actually think I'm gonna hang out with my old man.
That's weird.
Cool.
See you.
Weirdo.
Hi.
So I hear you're interested in joining the Sack Pack.
I might be.
Then perhaps this will wet your whistle of what's fun about being a member.
Just leave it.
Yeah.
You are terrible at Hacky Sack.
I think I'm retiring.
Yeah, I just want to say I would've noticed you.
Want to go do it in the teachers' lounge? - Yes.
You do? Oh, I'm gonna do it with a teacher! Shh.
Okay, something is definitely coming out.
I think we should go.
Previously on New Girl We're at a wedding together.
Guys, guys, shut and listen to me it's Cece.
She doesn't want to get married.
I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.
What I want is to be with someone else.
Are you in love with her or are you in love with me? You have to decide.
We tried.
We had one night.
Okay, what happened with Jess? We called it.
Yeah, when things get messy you just run away.
I know you think we should call it.
But I don't want to give up on this.
You know what? I gotta say, Jess, I really like you.
I really, really like you.
I really like you.
I can't believe this is happening.
It's crazy, but it's happening.
It's crazy.
I like you so much.
Yeah, I like you so much.
Like - Yeah.
I'm just - What? - I'm in.
You know? I'm - I'm just all in.
I'm all in.
I'm, like, weirdly all in.
Hey, Nick - What? Pull over.
Well, that was fun.
We finally broke in the Volvo.
Oh, my.
What's next? What do we do now? I'm really fighting the urge to buy you a lobster dinner.
Do we just go home? You know, I mean, just how is it actually gonna work? We've only been dating for 30 minutes and we're already living together.
What if you get tired of me, and you have nowhere to go because we're roommates, and so you have to sleep in your car Hey.
Stop.
That's not gonna happen.
I've wanted this for so long.
I don't want anything to go wrong.
Oh, it's Schmidt.
He's freaking out about Cece.
He doesn't need to reach you all the time.
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna ignore it for now.
It's all about us right now.
Hmm.
It's Schmidt.
He wants to know where you are.
He texted you to ask where I am? That's ugh.
He just texted I'm a bad friend.
You know what that is? Either male genitalia, or a really big thumbs down.
Why would he send me male genitalia? - Why can't he talk to Winston? Well, without me, they get so weird and they fight all the time.
This is what I'm talk How many times a day does Schmidt text you? I don't know, I'll just say 40.
How See, this is what I'm talking about.
I feel like we need time alone so we can figure out what this is.
Yes.
This is what I want.
I want to be with you alone, without anybody else.
Just you and Where have you been? I'm having a major life crisis, and you guys are, what? Just driving around, French-kissing each other like a couple Dutch hookers? What is that, Nick? Is that a hickey? - Disgusting! - Hey, you guys.
Um, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Now, I know everyone's going through a lot, but I think it is time for me to start a puzzle.
No, it isn't.
What is going on with you two? Are you, like, a couple now? Have you thought any of this through? Nick, please help me, okay? Stop being so selfish and just help me.
Okay, you know what? Give me one minute, - I'll be right inside.
We'll be right in.
Yeah, we just got to figure something out.
All right! Thanks, man.
The g*ng's back.
We'll be right in.
Yeah, good-bye, guys.
We love you guys.
Run! - Run! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Well, Winston, after 25 unanswered text messages to Nick and Jess this morning, I finally received a response.
A smiley face.
This leaves us with one choice - To become best friends.
Huh? Yeah, fine.
For r? Okay, great.
Now, as my best friend, I expect you to be willing to sacrifice everything for me at a moment's notice, including, of course, unfortunately for you, your dignity.
Yeah, fine.
Winston, what can I do for you? Don't talk to me that much, never lie to me, and never, ever touch my puzzle.
Winston, do we do we think now is really the right time to be starting a puzzle? I'm great at puzzles.
You're a born puzzler, Winston, sure, um, but don't you agree that sometimes, when you start puzzles, you get a little bit weird? And, I don't know, intense? Spend a lot of time humming.
Also spend a lot of time naked.
I'm gonna do you, puzzle! Right on the table.
As nasty as you want to be.
Hey, Schmidt, what do you think it's gonna look like? What do I think it's going to look like? - Yeah, the puzzle.
Winston, it's on the box.
The the picture's on the box.
It's a Japanese garden! Schmidt, calm down.
What is your problem? Two women are in love with me.
The problem is, is I'm in love with both of them.
Okay, looks like you're gonna have to choose.
Cece and I, we have this connection.
You know, it's physical it's unhealthy.
Look, I don't want to get too graphic with you, but I'm not just the plug with her.
I'm also a socket.
God okay, fine.
Schmidt, choose Cece.
Yeah, but - I was dating Elizabeth first, so - Mm-hmm.
Wait a minute Winston I was dating Elizabeth first.
You want to know what I think? - No, I don't.
Done.
Decided.
Ha! Cece, out.
I was dating Elizabeth first.
My man! Way to talk that out.
Yeah.
Best friends.
Best friends.
This is gonna work out, man.
Yeah, it's gonna work out, man.
Puzzling Winston is about to do some puzzling About to get into some puzzle troubling So, in conclusion, it's a you know, it's a very difficult decision that I've had to that, you know, that you guys have put me in, here, but I just I'm gonna be candid.
I've been up for 24 hours.
I have to return all of these gifts.
So just say it.
You don't want to be with me.
Wh huh? Look look at that.
I just looked down and I thought, "This girl must be wearing sneakers "with shoelaces, and th-those shoelaces must be tied together, because this girl is straight trippin', yo.
" - What? - Of course I want to be with you.
But I feel so terrible for Elizabeth.
How did she take it? Sh She took it.
In the marketplace of ideas, where culture is king, and data moves faster than people, where scalable opportunities come from turnkey solutions What are you trying to say, Schmidt? Is it over? No no.
As if.
Of course I picked you.
It wasn't even close.
Come here, you crazy white girl.
There it is.
Poor Cece.
Uh, yeah, okay.
Oh I fell asleep.
How long have you been driving? Those cops look like they're about 15 and they have huge g*n.
Jess, are we in Mexico? All in! We're in Mexico! Oh, my God, pull over! That piÃ±ata's shaped like a monkey! You know what? It's gonna be weird going back to having sex without a bunch of feral dogs watching.
Why am I not hungry? I should be hungry.
Remember when we lived in that loft, and, like, we had all those problems? Yeah.
All in! Voice mail? Again? Where have you been? It's been four days, man.
Have you really been doing it with Jess this whole time? That's disgusting.
Nick, I did something really wrong, and, uh I just I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to my friend.
Come home.
Yeah, I should try him again.
Dial best friend one.
Let's stay here.
We're totally out of money.
We got this great setup.
No, this is not gonna last long.
It's not gonna last long.
It isn't.
This is a badly built shelter.
We'll go right there.
How hard could that place be to sneak into? You all in? Nick, this has been fun, but Okay, look, everything that's bad is waiting for us back in the loft.
But here? I'm Paradise Nick.
And Paradise Nick is mega-chill.
And you're Paradise Jess, right? We can make food and just - All in.
All in.
It don't work like that.
If you uh Hey, man, how'd she take it? Devastated.
I'm sure glad that's settled.
Hey, man, I'm gonna go shower.
I'm proud of you.
I know it must have been tough.
Hey, Schmidt, who do you call if puzzle pieces are broken? Oh.
Hey, Winston.
Is, uh, is Schmidt home? Cece.
Oh, my goodness.
Hi.
Do you need a hug? All right.
Is Schmidt even here, Winston? Yeah.
Yeah, he's in the shower.
Um Cece, I just want to say, on my end, that I am so, so sorry.
Sorry about what? You know, uh Elizabeth.
Well, what about Elizabeth? He made love to her.
Winston made love to Elizabeth.
After I chose you, Winston was all too quick, in Elizabeth's vulnerable state, to rush in there and just get his jollies off.
His sweaty, disgusting jollies.
Seriously? I mean, she must have just been so upset and hurt I didn't even know you were interested in her.
Tell her what you did, Winston, and give her the short version, which you did not give to Elizabeth.
Wha? What I did um Okay, well, I drove over there to seduce her.
And I seduced her two and a half times.
Puzzle me this, then, Winston How do you live with yourself? I have a bit of a hard time believing that Winston would do this.
Well, then, you obviously don't know Winston, 'cause he's a sick, disgusting human being.
Just this morning he asked me for a pair of your underpants.
Winston? - Hmm? Is that true? Yes.
I needed your underwear to sew into my underwear.
Oh my God.
That is disgusting! You are a pervert! Oh, I'm so sorry, Cece.
Just wait in the car.
You don't have to deal with this disgusting trash person, garbage child! You're upset.
As you should be.
Oh, but that was great, man.
How long as this been going on, man? Four days.
Four days, and you didn't tell me? Come on, Schmidt! I said, "Don't lie to me.
" I'm sorry.
All right? I love both of these women and I couldn't decide.
I needed to buy some more time.
Cece thinks I'm wearing her panties right now! Well, that's on you, man! You freaked out super hard! You-you kidding me? That's so weird.
Sewing people's panties into underpants.
Look, we're not best friends, Schmidt.
As a matter of fact, we're not friends at all until you fix this.
Okay, all right, look.
Winston, I'm sorry, man.
W-Winston, you've been working on this puzzle for quite some time now.
You realize a lot of those puzzle pieces are upside down, right? It's just they're cardboard color.
Is that an almond that you have inserted into one of the pieces? Are you just eating them, or are you using them as pieces? You know that's an almond, right? Schmidt, come here! Free cocktails.
No way! - Yeah, fitting right in.
Oh, my God.
What? Security guard.
Freeze.
Okay, don't freeze.
That looks weird.
Did he notice you? Of course he noticed you.
You're the prettiest girl on the damn beach.
Shut up.
We need one of these bracelets right away, Jess.
Bracelet.
Yeah.
Oh, hey! Hey Hey, pal.
That's a really cool bracelet.
Do you think I could try it on? - No.
Listen to me, okay? Will you lean in here for a second and listen to me? One day, you're gonna meet a girl, you're gonna really like her, and you're gonna want to give her everything, but you won't be able to afford it because your life's kind of in shambles and you don't have money.
Look at you, kid, you got a great-looking face.
I don't know, you might have a tough go of it.
What do I know? Just promise me this Promise me you're gonna try to enjoy your life as much as you can, 'cause one day you're gonna be d*ad, and, you know.
Can I have your bracelet, for real? No.
If you don't give me the bracelet, I'm gonna strangle you to death.
Thanks, buddy.
Not cool.
But it worked, okay? We got the bracelet, so now we're back in action.
Hola.
Hola.
Can I see your bracelets, por favor? Yes.
Looks pretty on her, right? SeÃ±or? - Run! - No! I don't speak Spanish, you snake! What are you gonna do? I'm in the ocean now! I'm in international waters! I've got a shell.
Let's just go.
Let's just get out of here.
Point Break style? - No, no, no! I will Point Break style this moment! Nick, let's go! Nick, stop! Aah! Ow! Ow, that hurt! Wait! Where are you taking him?! - Jail.
Aah! Truce, okay? Winston, please, come on Talk to me.
I I need a friend right now.
I love both of these women, and I can't lose them, and I can't hurt them.
And we made a pact! No.
You lied to me.
You're a liar.
Okay, well, then would you like some truth, Winston? Here's some truth for you, okay? You're terrible at puzzles.
Worst I've ever seen by a mile.
What, do you have fly vision? Look at this puzzle.
It's ages six and up.
You are up, Winston.
You are way up! - You want to say that to my face? This is a corner piece, Winston! How do you not see that? What are you, blind?! I'm so sorry actually, a blind man could feel the smooth edges of a corner piece! You are making me so mad.
Ooh, you are making me so mad.
Oh, yeah? You're making me How am I making you? Am I making you? - Yes, you're making me mad.
What you want to do? What are you doing? Which way are you going? What is happening? - Ow! - What did you do? Don't mess with me, man.
I'm legit.
I'm legit, dude.
I'm getting very dizzy.
You coming at me, son? I need all the cash you have and Nick's passport! - What'd you say? What? - Nick's in trouble? What are we doing? Nick is in jail? Nick went to jail before me? Hey, stop it! Stop it! This is not the time for fighting.
Nick is in a Mexican jail.
We don't know this country.
We don't know their laws.
We don't know how to get him out.
I just hope he found somebody who can protect him and take care of him.
What, you hope he's somebody's bitch? - No, like a mentor.
He'd never be picked as a bitch.
Nick is very attractive.
He can be a bitch.
A sissy, perhaps, but a bitch? - He can be a bitch.
He cannot be a bitch.
My God, what's a sissy? - Are you insane? - A chubby gringo? - Stop it! Nick is my bitch.
Hola, seÃ±ores, seÃ±ora.
Hi.
Um, we have some questions.
Jess, I got this.
I know how to handle these people.
Is this for me? That's for you to send your kids to college, or for you to send some fun up your nose.
Your choice, bro.
Don't worry.
We're looking for our friend Nick Miller if he's still alive, and his head if it's separate.
You know who you should talk to? Manny.
Manny.
Manny.
Talk to Julio.
Julio.
Julio.
Talk to Brad.
I don't really feel right about this.
Oh, Jess, you're so naive.
It's a game.
We're working our way up the ladder.
Brad is clearly the kingpin.
Thanks so much.
Okay, that didn't work.
Next idea.
Well There are no next ideas, Schmidt! We're out of money! I need to just find somebody.
Oh, just find somebody? - Yes.
Right, Jess, 'cause the streets down here - they run red with hospitality.
Hey! Hey! Hi.
Sorry.
I met you yesterday.
You arrested a man named Nick Miller.
You got money? Money.
No, we don't have any money.
But wait, wait, wait! What about his shoes? Any interest in his shoes? There's no way you're getting these damn shoes, okay? These are my favorite brown shoes.
And besides, this is all your fault, Schmidt.
Nick's body's being traded like cigarettes right now! Winston, those shoes are not brown they're green.
What the hell you talking about, man? - Those shoes are green.
You guys are idiots, all right? They're as brown as money.
What color is Kermit the Frog? - Brown.
It's a brown frog.
Winston, you're color-blind, dude.
What? I am not color I am not color-blind.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
Sir, I'm so sorry.
We have no money.
We don't even have money for gas.
Oh, you got a car.
Want to trade? Hey.
Oh, my God, I thought he was taking you to jail.
No, it's resort jail, and it's not so bad.
They let me watch Ugly Betty.
Here, I brought you your passport.
Winston, enough! - Enough for me! Oh, Nicholas, thank goodness you're alive.
You brought them? I needed their help.
Winston does not get me at all.
What? And, plus, he's color-blind, which basically makes him crippled.
Please, tell me these shoes are brown, right? - Those shoes are green.
They're definitely green.
Okay, you both are crazy.
Winston! If you think those shoes are brown, what color do you think you are? Jess, I can't do this.
Do you really want to wake up to this every morning? It doesn't matter, as long as I wake up next to you.
I got an idea.
Let's move to Mexico.
What? - Yeah! - Hell no! - Nicolas, I need you.
If you leave, then I'm with Winston, and I can't handle that.
You and me, we work here.
If we go back to the loft, we're not gonna make it.
Yes, we are.
We are gonna make it.
You won't.
He's 100% right.
You will not.
I'm not ready to lose you.
I just got you, Jess.
And I'm not letting you go.
So I'm all in.
I'm shredding this passport.
I'm not leaving Mexico.
Oh, no, you are not, sir! - No, no, no, wait, wait! I will put myself in that shredder before you put your passport in there! Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, switch! - Put yourself in there.
Stop! Stop, Nick! I will shred my ear! I'll do it! - Your ear could go in! - I will shred myself! I will shred myself in the shredder.
Get serious! Stop.
Listen to me.
We're a family.
You can't choose who you love.
Sometimes they choose you.
And sometimes, it's just because you got a really great deal on Craigslist.
I got a really great deal on Craigslist.
I got all of you.
There is no "us" without Schmidt and Winston.
It's gonna be really, really hard.
But so what, Nick? So what? I believe in us.
I'm all in.
I really want to go home.
Come on, man, let's just go home.
You know what? I love you guys.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Great.
Oh, my God! No! Get it out! Get it out! Unplug it, Nick! The shredder shredded it, bro.
No, no, no, no, guys, we're fine.
I can work with this.
Okay, everybody.
Just be cool.
Act normal.
U.
S.
citizens? Passports, please.
What is this? Sir, my name is Winston Bishop.
I'm a color-blind American citizen, and I can't do puzzles.
Now let us go home.
It says "Unatered Stites of Amurica.
" You ready? Hey, I got you something, actually.
I mean, I stole it from a kid, but We can do this.
-Yeah, we can do this.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Here we go, huh? It's locked.
I think somebody accidentally locked this.
Where's your key? - I don't carry a key.
You don't carry a key? - No, I don't carry a Why would I carry a key? There's always somebody home! And I know how to jimmy the Mmm, my God I like you so much.
I like you, too.
And I'll start carrying a key.
Okay, I'll carry a key for you.
For the love of God, Winston, please just go unlock the door.
This is so weird.
Yeah Sayonara, masturbation, for the rest of my life.
Hey, Cece, it's Schmidt.
Hi.
You want me to come over tonight? I think I can make that work.
Uh, can you give me, like, five minutes? Great.
Um ooh, actually, could you hold on one second? Hi, Elizabeth, my darling.
How are you? Uh, tonight? You want to tonight.
Um, could you just give me one second so I can check my calendar? That'd be great.
I just checked it, and, uh it looks like there's a slight problem.
Um Puzzling I am puzzling Looks good to me.
This is my masterpiece
Hey, guys! Hurry up!
I'm the maid of honor and I have to be there early and I wanna get a picture in before we go.
Miami Vice called and I'm not sure... I don't know how to finish that joke.
What?
Ah, it's a crap joke, scratch it.
Winston, please. Your belly is on my hip.
Dad, can you come and take our picture?
All right.
Having a little trouble getting off this air mattress.
Oh, here we go.
And we... okay. I'm off, I'm off.
Here... where is it? All right, give me this.
Let's do this.
Okay, you ready?
Scrunch together. There we go.
No... uh, Rick, move one step to your right.
Me?
Yes, one step to your right.
One more step to your right.
I can't go much further.
One more step to your right.
Until you get into the hallway, and then, once you get in the hallway... No, I see what you're doing, dude. - Dad, Very funny, buddy. - Dad, Dad, we have to go...
...go directly to the Chinatown trash can where you got that suit. - There's nothing wrong with this suit. - Dad, we need to take the picture.
I wore this at my high school graduation.
Nick, you're not doing yourself any favors.
I look very handsome. I look like I'm on Miami Vice.
Should I take the picture?
No, I'm not doing this.
He's getting on me about the suit.
You're ruining the picture. - Okay.
I'm not doing it. I'm out of here.
Stop. Where are you going?
Was gonna do my cool poses.
You ready? One, two...

You changed.
Check it out.
Schmidt gave me his worst suit.
He said, if I could get it over my thighs, he didn't want it.
Miami Vice called, and this time, I answered.
Yeah?
Yeah!
I hope you're not doing all this
'cause of what my dad said.
I don't think you're an unemployable alcoholic bummer.
What?
No, I don't think you're a child.
Whoa, when did he say that?
Hmm?
What?
Bob said that about me?
Anyway, the point is... I don't think you're any of those things.
We're at a wedding together.
It's nice, right? You look great.
Thanks. So do you.
I'm gonna go find Cece.
Yeah.
All right, I guess we're doing that.
There are so many fun, cool traditions at this thing.
The groom comes in on a white horse.
So, basically, they're just copying my Bar Mitzvah.
Oh, my goodness.
That is Bucky the Badger, Wisconsin's mascot.
Yeah, I got a sweatshirt with his face on it, and he's wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it.
Bucky cool. Bucky!
He's got a super weird thing with badgers.
Is that a real badger?
Hey, the ceremony lasts for three hours, so you better go pee now. You know, your weak bladder.
You remembered.
Of course I did.
Now I have to pee. Every time you say "pee," I have to pee.
Thank you for coming.
Go pee. Okay.
I'm gonna.
It's okay to be nervous.
But nothing can go wrong.
All you have to do is go out there, get married, and I will do the rest, okay?
Schmidt!
Get out.
Well, this certainly isn't the bathroom.
Get out. Get out.
Guys, guys, shut up and listen to me - it's Cece.
She doesn't want to get married.
Damn. - What happened?
Well, her exact words were: "I don't want to marry Shivrang, "but my whole family has flown out here from all the way across the world.
I can't back out now. Please, Schmidt, as my closest friend, help me."
What did Jess say?
Well, Jess didn't hear it -
Cece told me with her eyes.
Oh, so nothing happened. - Cool, so she's marrying Shivrang. - No, guys, I know Cece -
I know her looks.
Schmidt, what were you doing back there?
Cece's backing out of the wedding.
What?
It's true. She told me.
With her eyes.
Oh, my God.
I thought you were talking about something real. Schmidt.
The wedding's happening - let her go.
I have let her go. I'm with Elizabeth now and she's amazing.
Look, Jess, I'm telling you this as Cece's friend and nothing more.
Cece loves Shivrang - I know that 'cause I know her better than you do.
False. When you've had sexual congress with someone and you've peered into their soul at the exact moment of fulfillment... Ew.
No, no, hear him out.
Schmidt, listen up and listen good.
You are not to talk to Cece, you are not to look at Cece, and you are not to have eye conversations with her.
Or I will bust you.
Hard.
And later, I'm gonna bust you hard.
Yeah, you are.
Good night, nurse. I've been naughty.
Sorry, I didn't know - you guys were supposed... not supposed to hear that, so... Bros ever before the ho.
Anybody have a jar?
I'm sorry, okay?
But we have to sabotage this wedding.
Winston?
No, guys, look, you always bring me into these situations, and I get in over my head because I love pranks.
I really do. I mean, you know that.
Yeah. - But look, it's time for me to just face the facts that I'm no good at them.
You know, I'm 31 now, and it's time for me to cut the nonsense.
You're 100% right, man, but just, I don't know... what about today, just today... you give me full-on crazy?
Yeah!
You listen here!
Hey, hey, hey. Nobody's doing anything!
Yeah! - What?
What?
Jess asked us not to, so we are going to enjoy Cece's wedding like adults.
So good night, nurse.
Sorry for saying that.
I am all... I'm all turned around.
We sabotaging this thing or what?
Absolutely.
Hello, Auntie.
This is embarrassing.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Elizabeth. Can I talk business?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I want you to call it off.
What?
Whatever you're planning on doing, don't do it.
This wedding means a lot to Jess.
What are you doing?
What has happened to you?
You changed your suit, you're carrying her purse. - Yeah, I am.
You're wearing deodorant under both arms... Both arms, yeah.
Why are you trying so hard, man? Either Jess wants the real you or... or she don't.
The real Nick would help me sabo this wedding.
Is "sabo" short for sabotage, Schmidt?
Why would you...?
I mean, why would you even say that?
I knew it was. I was being mean.
I was bullying you to get dominance in this moment.
You know it... of course you know... you know it is.
I want you to call it off.
You know it's... You know "sabo" is short for sabot... sabotage.
I know... I know... Hey, skin it and call it off.
You got it, man.
Thanks, man.
I'll call it off. No problem, Nicholas.
Thank you, buddy. I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Now.
Now?
Shivrang, hold on!
Ow, my testicles!
Don't get on the highway!
Just reared up and just took off... I'm scared that it might have damaged me.
No, no, no, no damage.
Are you enjoying the wedding festivities, Schmidt?
What a spunky horse.
I know you're responsible for the horse thing.
Was I?
Yes.
Was I?
Yes.
Was...?
Yes.
Was...?
Yes.
Was I?
Yes.
Was I?

Turn it off! - I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to.
Turn it off!
Nick!
Pranks!
Wrong way!
What... What did you... Of course!
Of course you were scheming with Schmidt.
Jess, I didn't do anything.
You think that Schmidt and Winston would be smart enough to duct-tape the sound board?
That's brilliant!
Plus, we both know that this is your CD.

Winston must have taken that out of my car.
How gullible do you think I am? You're fist-pumping right now.
No, I'm not fist-pumping.
Yes, you are.
Aah!
It's so freaking catchy.
I thought I could count on you.
I thought things would be different now.
How could you think I would do this at your best friend's wedding?
Because it's exactly the type of thing that you do.
A stupid, childish prank.
Oh, childish?
You're right.
I'm a child.
Great sabo, man!
I'm so good at pranks, man.
I feel alive.
Really good... Phase three.
What's phase three? Whatever it is, I'm in.
Let's do this.
Uh, hey, Jess?
Hmm?
We went too far.
What?
It's bad.
How bad?
It's really bad.
Schmidt... What did you do?
It was Winston's idea.
Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry, okay? I didn't want anybody to get hurt, but it's too late now.
It's bigger than all of us.
Tell me everything.
Or, so help me God, I will mess up your hair.
Your precious hair.
Winston's in the... What?
Winston's in... What? Say it louder. Say it louder.
Winston is in the air ducts with a badger.
What?!
Nick's there, too.
Ah, Nick.
You've never gone along with one of my pranks before.
This is exciting.
I never noticed, but you kind of have a girl butt. Is that weird to say?
This priest is never gonna know what h*t him.
Wait, that is the plan?
You're gonna drop a badger on a priest?
Oh! He's mad.
That can't be the plan, man!
What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?
I deserve this. I deserve this. I deserve this, okay?
It's just, when Nick got involved, it became too big.
What? What do you mean, "when Nick got involved"?
He wasn't always involved?
No. He said no.
He said, "Jess means too much to me," or some crapola like that.
What are you doing?
Calling Nick.
Jess, he's in the ducts!
The ducts!
Beautiful ceremony.
Happy day.
The ducts!
I know where he is, Schmidt.
What? No, no.
That's my phone.
I said no phones.
I know. I'm gonna get it.
They can track us with phones.
What is going...? Relax. You're so weird with pranks.
What is going on with you?
Put the phone away!
I'm trying to! I'm trying to turn it off, you idiot!
Oh... no.
What's going on?
Uh... Bucky got out of his cage, man.
No! No! I'm getting out of here!
Let's go get him. No, you're coming with me.
You got to help me find the badger, Nick!
You don't be no bitch!
I want out of this place!
Bucky!
God bless both of you.
May he shower you with many, many children.
Ugh, he's not picking up.
Of course he's not picking up. He's in the... - Don't say it.
...ducts.
He's in the ducts.
Nick, stop being a bitch! Don't be no bitch!
Bucky!
I'm going up there.
Okay, good.
'Cause I really don't want to go up there. Look, I'm the kind of guy that likes to enjoy the AC, not see how the sausage is made.
Seriously, Schmidt? Shut up and give me a boost.
Bucky... Aah.
Winston!
Nick, where are you?
Marco... Polo!
I don't want to play that.
No!
Nick, it's me!
Nick, it's me!
Jess, what are you doing here?
Look, I-I know you didn't plan the sabotage, and I know you're doing this just to get back at me, but please don't do this.
Jess, it's not about the sabotage, okay?
It's about the fact that you think I'm gonna screw up everything I touch.
No, Nick, I don't.
You know what, Jess?
This is where I belong.
With Winston and a badger.
All right, Nick, look, let's just go get the badger and get out of here.
Can't get the badger because it's loose.
What?!
Hey, Jess, welcome, welcome.
No! Jess!
You know, I'm just staying positive, but, uh... I'm pretty sure this is where we die.
Winston!
When you complete the seven circles, you will be officially married.
You don't have to walk so fast, you know.
Guys?
Guys, you know... I've been thinking a lot about the Earth.
We got to leave it better than when we found it.
Is this what you wanted your life to be?
Is this how you wanted to enjoy your best friend's wedding?
Nick, look, no. Stop that.
I am not a healthy person.
Yeah, I know. I know, Nick.
Oh, you do?
So a part of you agrees with your dad.
No.
Just... oh, my... Okay. We got to get out of here.
...lovely ceremony with all your family and friends.
Tell me that there isn't a small part of you that's scared that I'm too much of a mess.
We have to go.
That this thing is a mistake.
You and me.
Just admit it, Jess.
Yes, there is a small part.
Yeah.
But... Run!
Oh, my... It's okay.
Jess?
Always a bridesmaid... Aah! Something touched my leg!
You know, sometimes I feel like I never really felt love, you know?
Do you know?
Hey! Hey, hey, everybody.
Hi. Hi. I'm Jessica Day. I'm the, uh, maid of honor.
I'm also the person who fell through the roof with my friend Nick Miller here.
Um, I have a few things to say.
Um, there might be a badger on the loose, but I have my best people on it.
I'm on it. Don't scare the badger!
Schmidty, help me!
Okay!
Funnel it into the mandap!
Okay.
Hey, guys. He's in the ninth row.
He is headed north.
Where were we? Um, Your Honor, please tell us where we were.
We were on the seventh circle.
So close.
Great. Cece, go.
Jess, you don't have to fix this.
Fix what?
This is a perfect day.
I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.
And it's not because of the horse.
Or the badger.
Or "Cotton-Eyed Joe."
This isn't what I want.
What I want is to be with someone else.
Shivrang, I feel terrible. I'm sorry.
No... No, Cece, it is okay.
In fact, it's more than okay.
I don't know why I didn't tell you the truth ages ago, but... but I want to be with someone else, too.
Really?
Yes.
I have tried to forget you, Elaine - really, I have - but I just can't.
Who the hell is Elaine?
And I don't care what my family says.
I want to marry you in a Presbyterian church.
Oh, Shivvy.
I've loved you since the first grade.
And I'm so lonely without you. I just lay awake at night, and I just write about you in my journal, and I paint pictures of you on my easel.
I want our children to be photographers and... and backpack across Europe.
Will you take me away from this madness?
And you are not too short for me. I don't care what your mother says.
Oh, Elaine!
Come!
Let's go to Vegas and elope!
I feel slightly rejected.
Well... you were slightly rejected.
Yeah.
You okay?
Well, I'm not as good as Elaine.
Who could be?
I feel better than I've felt in a long time.
Good. I'm glad.
Boobies.
I don't think the badger's actually rabid. I think, um... he's just kind of a dick. So... Hey, Nick.
You okay?
Me? Yeah.
You mean from the fall?
Yeah. And... what we talked about.
Yeah. Look, Jess, it's not... you know, that big of a deal.
And we tried. It's just... You might be right about your fears, you know, it's... Just... just say it.
I-I think we should call it, you know?
It's not like we're in love or anything.
We had one night.
Okay, let's call it.
I think that feels good to me.
Does that feel good to you?
But you must have feelings for her.
You tried to sabotage her wedding.
I sabotaged her wedding as a friend.
I didn't want her to marry someone else as a friend.
It's only mantic because it's a wedding.
I would be just as happy to sabotage, I don't know... let's say, her tax audit.
Schmidt.
Weird day, huh?
It's a beautiful wedding, Cece.
Thank you.
It was Schmidt that you were talking about, right?
It was.
I'm-I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
Don't be sorry. It's not your problem. It's Schmidt's.
Why is it... Why is it my problem?
Who's it gonna be?
Me or her?
No, she's right.
You have to choose.
We're gonna do this now?
But can... can we sleep on it, maybe? Maybe take the night?
I've got... I just got this brand-new Coldplay bootleg. Live from Rotterdam.
What if we just make some pasta and really listen to it?
Are you in love with her or are you in love with me?
You have to decide.
Can I get a beer?
Heisler?
Perfect.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Bucky bit me.
Bit me bad.
Hmm.
Yeah. So, um... so I'm pretty dizzy.
Okay.
Okay, what happened with Jess?
We called it.
And she left.
Yeah, we-we called it off.
So, now I'm gonna drink, because that's my move.
Yeah. That was also your dad's move.
Yeah, when things get messy, you just run away.
But, you know, there are other moves.
Go.
Thanks, man.
Hey, bartender, can you call an ambulance?
I'm about to bleed out.
Thanks, man.
Look, I know you think we should call it, but I don't want to give up on this, even if we don't know what this is.
I want to un-call it.
Please, can we un-call it?
Before you say no... Don't say no.

Yeah, I would love to. I just - um, my dad's in town, so... I'm kind of out on a limb here. I really talked you up to the principal.
Guess what. Spoiler alert. He's perking me.
Can you be here in 30 minutes?
Okay, I'll figure it out.
Amy! Put those back in your shirt, both of them.
Oh, my God. I have the chance to teach kids again.
You got to go.
Oh... Dad, you should come with me.
Yes, you should go with your daughter!
What am I gonna do, sit in your car and get mugged?
I mean, I didn't gay my way out of Vietnam just to be k*lled by some punk.
No, no. No, I'll stay with him.
Oh, no, no, that, uh, that doesn't work.
That's a bad idea.
That's - I've-I've got stuff I got to do, so... Stuff?
Yeah.
You don't have any stuff. Name one stuff.
Documents.
Documents?
Yeah, I got documents.
Okay, I get it.
You know, I'm always alone, so, I'll just, uh... be alone.
Do not fall for it.
I am falling for it.
Do not fall for it. - I am falling for it right this second. I'm feeling bad.
I'll stay!
That's terrific.
Jess... Jess.
Hi! Yay, tomorrow's your big day! Hooray!
Listen, I'm gonna be a little bit later than I thought I would be, but it's gonna be worth it, because last night... Just hang on. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
Guys, it's too loud in here, okay?!
Uncle Shishir!
He had one scene with Salman Khan in Dabangg 2, and all of the sudden he thinks he's Amitabh Bachchan in Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.
I could just tell you later.
I am exhausted, and I still have to go pick up my wedding sari, and I still have to get my hands henna'd.
Okay, look, just send everybody to their hotels.
I'll have Winston pick up your sari, and then after you're done having your hands tattooed, take a nap.
Now hand the phone to Shishir.
Uncle. Jess.
Shishir, you son of a bitch. You little son of a bitch.
It is not your day!
Hey, Winston.
What's up?
Anything you want to wish me?
Look, Winston, I need you to pick up Cece's wedding sari and take it to her house.
You want me to take it to her house?
Yeah. Just go pick it up.
Ah, wedding sari, for the celebration of the wedding.
Yes, nothing else.
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing, but just do it, okay? Um, I have to go.
It's happening!
Peg, hi. Thank you so much for the interview.
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, no interview.
You're getting right in the soup; you're subbing.
I need Al to see you in action.
What? Subbing?
It's a really busy day; I don't think I could sub... Oh, yes you can.
...right now.
What? No.
This is your chance.
Oh, my... Ah, stop! You have to stop!
Hey, guys.
All right.
Okay, listen!
Or don't!
But the hell if I'm not gonna teach!
I'm gonna bring the words of Mark Twain alive with only the human voice.
What about you? You got a girl?
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, really?
No, no, no, no. No girls for me. No.
Seriously? A good-looking guy like you?
It'd seem like women would just flock to you. - No, no, it's not like that.
Let's talk about you and girls! I don't want to talk about this. - ...and a young guy.
This isn't something we should talk about, Bob, trust me! - Okay, gee whiz, I'm sorry.
Just freakin' back off.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
All right.
What?
What?
There's a girl. Yes.
There is, see? I told you.
I knew - There's always a girl.
There - you're right.
Come on, what's she like?
She's, uh, not quirky.
No?
She's got no bangs.
No bangs.
Uh, tall and fat.
Really?
Yeah. Really ugly eyes.
Small, tiny little beady eyes.
Yeah. Yeah.
Her name is, uh, Yolanda Winston.
Yolanda Winston.
Just wallpaper! I have fancy athletic shoe wallpaper.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?
I got here early, so I wanted to come up.
That shirt is, uh...
12 years old.
It's the shirt I met you in.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Y2 Kitty Kat.
As relevant today as it was then.
Schmidt, do you have a moment?
I have unlimited moments.
I was reviewing the numbers... Custodial keeps sending us these spooky Eastern European girls.
You want to see spooky? Call me spooky again.
I'll spook the ass fat right out of your lips.
Do you know her?
Mm... no... No?
I... I feel like I'm trap... I'm being trapped, am I not?
Then I'll do you a favor and set you free.
Idiot.
Wait, don't leave. Elizabeth!
I don't know why I just did that!
I knew you couldn't change back!
But why are you wearing that shirt?!
I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad about myself! I love this shirt!
Y2 Kitty Kat?
I don't need this.
I was fine before you showed up.
In fact, I said no to a date tonight to be with you!
I'm gonna text him "Yes."
And guess what.
I don't care what you think.
See ya, Schmidt.
Without validation, the parking rates are absurd.
Jamie, enough with the globes. We get it. You're angry.
Okay, that's lunch. Be back in an hour.
Jess!
I'm Dr. Foster.
Oh.
Peg has gone on and on and on and on and on about you.
So nice to meet you. I'm just running out for lunch... Uh! No, no, need. No need.
During the lunch that I... But you don't need.
We can have lunch here.
My secretary is bringing food.
So we'll have a chitchat, tête-à-tête, exchange-ideas kind of lunch.
To see how you'll fit in to the Coolidge culture.
Um, well, long story short, I really would love this job, I love teaching kids... Ha!
Now, what if you weren't referring to children... Oh. Uh-huh?
...but to baby goats?
Huh.
That's an interesting question.
Well, we used to have a school goat named Melvin.
Uh... He hanged himself, tragically, on the swing set.
So... we bought another goat.
Also named Melvin.
Surprise!
Yeah, you can come out now!
I see some-some food over here. Where my cake at?
Hey, where my cake at?!
I can hear you giggling, I can see the... Where's my sari?
Something on your face. What's that, like, a wedding tattoo? - What do you mean there's something on my face?
Wait-wait a minute. Hold-hold on, hold on. What are you doing?
Lettuce, tomato, lettuce, meat-meat-meat-meat-meat- meat-meat-meat-meat, cheese, lettuce.
You're a sandwich genius.
Is there anything you don't know everything about?
Try me.
All right, I will try you. I've got a question about Yolanda Winston.
Sure.
Well, we've only slept together once, but, Bob, I don't know what she wants.
Well, the first thing you got to figure out is what do you want.
Well, I don't know how you get a podcast, but you should look into it.
Bob here.
Hey, Dad, new plan. Headed over to Cece's.
How's it going over there?
Great. We're making sandwiches, we're talking about girls.
Interesting. Could you hand the phone to Nick?
Jess. Yeah, she wants to talk to you.
Oh, cool. Jess!
What is going on over there, Nick?!
Hanging out with my boy Bobby D.
Bobby D! I love that!
Talking about girls?!
That's the one thing you should not be talking about!
You are freaking out about noth... Hey, you know what?
I don't like what's happening here. I am coming home.
Just relax. I think he really likes me.
Oh, it's Cece. I have to take this.
Cece, hi.
What's going on?
I fell asleep on my hand!
Oh!
It's not as bad as I thought.
I'm getting married tomorrow, and I look like Mike Tyson!
Okay, nothing a little cotton b*lls and olive oil can't fix.
In a few minutes, we are gonna laugh about this. We will laugh.
Okay.
This is funny later.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Oh, see?
It's coming right off.
Um... All gone?
Burkas isn't you guys, is it?
This girl really means a lot to me, Bob.
And I just don't want to screw it up.
Why would you screw it up?
I don't want to make excuses, but my dad was kind of a... a piece of... You know, truth be told, Bob, I'm afraid I'm a lot like him.
The mere fact that you just said that means that you're nothing like your old man.
Any girl would be lucky to have a guy like you.
You mean that?
Yes, I do.
Think I'm gonna say something that might make you real happy.
That little girl I was talking about, Yolanda?
Her name isn't Yolanda.
It's Jess.
She's your daughter.
I'll k*ll you!
You're d*ad! You're d*ad!
Hi, you-you tattooed my friend this morning for her wedding.
Is there a quick way of getting it off?
Uh-huh. Okay!
Um, wonderful. Thank you so much, Dipti.
That's awesome. Thanks.
It's not coming off.
Nope, it's not.
Absolutely not.
Okay, look, um, Cece, I think maybe you should call Shivrang.
I don't want him to see me like this, Jess!
Like, what have you done?!
What I've done?
You're the dummy who fell asleep on your hands!
I'm so sorry. That shouldn't have come out of my mouth.
That was really uncool. I've just had a crazy 24 hours, and... I slept with Nick last night.
You slept with Nick?
I don't know.
I think it might be the start of something, like, really amazing.
Mm-hmm, sure. - I don't want to get my hopes up, but it could be something.
Could not be something.
Makes sense.
I don't know.
I have a full beard!
No.
Oh, no, no.
I'm not scared of you, dude.
What are you doing with that?
Put that down; I'm not gonna hurt you.
Okay.
Okay, conversation's over.
Nick, hands up, back away. What is this?
Dad, you're coming with me now.
You want to get rid of me?
So you two can do it again?
What?!
You told him?! God, I knew you would blurt it out.
Shows how much you know; I didn't blurt it out.
I told him on purpose.
Why would you do that?!
What is wrong with you?!
I wanted him to like me - in fact, I want all fathers to like me.
I wonder what that's about.
W-What, do you owe money on the rent?
I mean, what-what is going on here?
Dad, I don't know what's going on.
We haven't had a chance to talk it out yet.
Well, when did this happen?
Last night.
Nick!
Why am I telling you this?
Jess, why are you picking him? He's a lazy, drunken cable thief.
Wh-What's wrong with Wilson?
Dad, there's nothing wrong with Nick.
You don't even know him.
I do know him.
I know him.
When I was young, I was confused, I was lost, I had no plan.
But I went ahead and got married anyway.
And if I had figured things out before I got married, I might still be with your mother.
So I do know you.
You're not your father.
You're me.
And I'm not good enough for my little girl.
Yeah I got my own damn cake, and you can't have none!
I got to... No, I really... Nick, wait, Nick... Damn it, Dad!
You know I'm right.
Oh, I have to go.
I have to go back to school now.
You sure you want to be eating so much cake with a body like that?
Guys?
Guys?
I've had a bad day!
Sit down!
All of you!
What is with everyone today?
Everything started so good.
Boy.
My roommate.
It was good, I'm not gonna lie.
It was very good.
But I can't date my dad.
Look... life's messy.
It kicks you in the ass.
That's right, I said "ass."
But it does, it kicks you in the ass.
And, um... the messy parts are the... best parts.
Thank you, Miguel.
The gesture is very sweet.
These are very bad for you.
I've got a car.
I could take you to the movies.
No, you don't... You do?
Jess called you?
Yeah, she said you needed me.
She also told me to watch out for the girl who looked like Mandy Patinkin We can't get married like this.
Hey, look, if this is our biggest problem, I'll take it.
I'll make a call and fix it.
Now that your mom's d*ad, do you do all the landlording yourself?
Uh-huh.
You want to dance?
I'm wearing the shirt that you got me.
Did you think I threw it away?
Frogetaboutit.
Go home, Schmidt.
I don't want to go home, Elizabeth.
Look, I want to be with you.
Anl-I don't care who knows it.
Hey, Geppetto.
Make with the "oom pah pah."
We have a pump that can blow that thing up in, like, two seconds.
I prefer to do this the old-fashioned way.
I know that's not the way things are done around here.
So long as I'm in town, I am going to sleep between you and him.
Dad, you don't have to worry about me.
I know you think this is gonna be a mess, but it's my mess.
Jess, I'm your father I'll always worry about you.

Cool.
Hey, does it hurt for the guys?
Not one bit.
If I pee while it's happening, will she die?
How many minutes before sex is it... is it okay to eat?
I don't think it's an exact science.
I think it depends on your frame.
So, I should eat right before.
In terms of lubricant, do I put a small amount everywhere or do I use a large amount
in a small... in a smaller area?

You're harshing my vibe,
Schmidt.
You're the coolest, Nick.
You know, so I'd already taken the mushrooms.
Obviously.

Very interesting.
Uh, uh, uh.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
I'm gonna do it to you.
You're gonna do what to me?
(crying)
I don't know.
Are you crying?
Please, excuse me, but I had to lay off a lot of really good men today at work.
What's wrong with your friend?
He's a virgin.
Aren't you a virgin, too?
Just my penis, baby.
Just my penis.
WINSTON So Mysteria and I made love that night.
For ten beautiful seconds.
So, what do you do for a living?
(snickers)
And it was good.
Nick, I can't believe you lost your virginity to Octopussy.
I couldn't go through with it.
It's 'cause the boy had no game.
He couldn't close.
Okay, you don't need game.
They were prost*tute.
My dad told me.
PopPop told you? When?
Nicky, you here?
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.
What are you doing?
If I'm being totally honest, I've had some alcoholic beverages tonight.
Well, to be totally honest with you, so have I.
How do you think I got through Annie?
Geez, that was rough.
What happened here?
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't make love to Ms. Octopussy tonight.
It's too dangerous, and I was afraid the FBI was gonna track me down or a paper trail.
You think too much.
You think too much about everything.
When I was your age, my dad got a girl for me, too.
I mean, this is almost a Miller family tradition.
You should have seen her boobs.
They were great.
Real pointy, just like I like 'em.
Gross.
Listen, Nicky, you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
I just want to make sure that you don't miss out on the things in life that are happening when you're not thinking.
Because, believe you me,
those... are the best things in life.
I think I really like drinking.
Well, that's great.
That's wonderful. That's good.
That's a great start.
It's really fun.
It makes me feel good.
Good.
(chuckles)
Uh...
Don't tell Winston about the girls.
You know,
that they're... pros.
Yeah, I won't. I don't want to break his heart, you know?
Okay.
I mean, you can tell him, but just...
wait, you know?
Maybe after I'm gone.
I'll tell him when you're d*ad.
So it's time you should know.
Mysteria...
On the bright side, looks like you won the contest.
Actually...
Jess, look at him.
Let him have this.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston.
I just can't let you win this.
My story...
involves...
m*rder.
(laughs)
Was Mysteria even her real name?
No.
So I'd just moved to L.A. to be with Cece, and we went out to some bar.
Do you remember where that was?
No.
How did I get this far without having sex?
In three years,
I'm gonna be .
I can't rent my first car as a virgin.
They'll know.
Okay. What about those guys over there?
Mega beer!
Party!
Pour beer at the same time.
Yeah!
They are definitely single.
Yeah!
I mean, k*ll me.
Oh, my God.
It was the guy from prom night.
It was fate.
Want to get out of here?
(chuckles)
Like, to do it?
(chuckles)
Yeah. I'd be down with that.
Yes.
Um, but I'm kind of living
out of my car right now.
Damn it.
Yeah.
And I'm sleeping on my friend's couch.
Do you like DVDs?
Do you sell cookies?
Not a cookie bar.
I have an idea.
(kissing sounds)
Hey, uh, I'm kind of on a lot of antidepressants right now, so this may kind of take a while.
The only antidepressants you need are in my pants.
Uh, it's really a medical issue.
I'm so sorry.
That was really uncool.
And... take as much time as you need.
So, two hours later...
still nothing.
It was like a wind sock on a windless day.
Give me an update, brother.
How's your wang?
(crying)
Do you have, like, an...
Is there, like, an
angle you could...
like... I mean...
It's just... it's so much easier when it's, like, in the shower, you know, and you're by yourself and you don't...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
And there's no one with you.
Well, what can I do to help? Listen, why don't we try our luck on the other side of the castle, okay?
(muffled grunting)
JESS Oh, my God!

We're stuck.

Sir, um, we tried to make love on the bench, but, uh, there was a man there.
Oh, he's still there.
He must have been very tired.
He slept through all those sirens.
This man's d*ad.
What?!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

I had sex with a hooker.

It belonged to my father.
We have the same exact butt.

I'm dressed for my Booty Burn Boot Camp class. I know what you're thinking.
It's not because I need it. I go to inspire the others.
Please take that thing off. You look like a homeless pencil.
I will not take it off. I have a pass.
A pass? What kind of pass?
A d*ad Dad Pass.
Which means I can do what I want when I want and no one can say anything about it.
Like right now, I want to tap dance, and you, Jess, you cannot tell me that this isn't tap.
Nick, that's just not tap!
My dad d*ed!
I'm sorry. It's just not.
Hey, y'all. Look at these fancy invites.
Do you think it's to a gala event? I've always wanted to go to a gala event.
Yeah.
What the hell are you wearing?
d*ad Dad Pass.
Oh, my God! It's Cece's wedding.
Wait a minute.
It's in three weeks?
She didn't tell me it was in three weeks.
Cece didn't give me a plus-one. How dare she not give me a plus-one.
You can't invite an ex to a wedding and not give him the dignity of consolation sex. Girl better recognize.
Schmidty gonna go get his plus-one.
Ew, Nick, what are you doing?
d*ad Dad Pass.

I have not technically been asked to be maid of honor, but I am throwing Cece's surprise bachelorette party here tonight, and the only males invited are strippers, so oil up or get out, guys.
Seriously though, this is a really big deal for her.
Some girls plan their weddings, Cece planned her bachelorette party.
I want to have the dirtiest bachelorette party of all time.
Then you better have it in a pigpen.
No, I mean I want strippers and a mechanical bull and balloons in the shape of ding dongs, and I want to wear the kind of underwear that goes between your cheeks.
I'm also gonna need your help.
Oh, God. We could've left.
See. You know what?
We had ample opportunity to leave.
I saw it coming miles away and did nothing. Me, too.
No. I just need you to kidnap Shivrang so I can get Cece alone.
Roughhouse him a little bit, drop him off in the desert till he don't breathe no more?
What?!
I'm so happy you guys could come help.
All the way from India.
Aw, look at all the ladies bonding.
This is so exciting. You know, Grandmother and Ankita Auntie just couldn't wait to meet you.
Yeah...
Just a little overwhelmed.
I'm gonna take a...
I know.
Wait, listen.
Look, babe. Just think.
When all of this madness is over, you and I will finally get to, you know...
What are you doing?
Freaking me out.
You know, make love.
Which I am personally looking forward to greatly.
And we'll already be married forever.
I'll-I'll get it.
Hello... Shivrang? What are you doing here?
I, uh... You stole my question.
Hi. How are you doing? My invitation didn't have a plus-one.
If this is a mistake, I would just like an apology for the pain that you've caused me.
Also reimbursement for all travel expenses.
Not a mistake. There's no plus-one.
Who is this?
I'm Gérard Depardieu.
Do you think I am, lady? I'm Schmidt.
Get in my room right now, Schmidt. Move.
I'm going to your room right now.
Hey, you listen to me. That is my future family, okay?
You cannot speak like that in front of them.
And, no, you cannot have a plus-one.
This wedding has a budget.
Plus-ones are for spouses and serious partners only.
So you just assume that I won't have a serious partner by then?
I know for a fact you won't, okay? You're not a relationship guy, and that is fine.
I can do anything I put my mind to.
I once figured out Alyssa Milano's phone number just by randomly choosing numbers.
Every girl that I've ever slept with wants to be my girlfriend. It's just the way that it is.
If you have a real girlfriend by the time of the wedding, I will happily give you a plus-one.
Challenge accepted.
Not a challenge. - Time to go make some dreams come true.
I...
Hey, ladies.
I just want to thank you all for coming on such short notice for Cece's last night of freedom.
Hi, models.
Hi. - Hi. - I'm a lawyer.
Hi.
I'm Sadie.
I'm a lesbian.
Hey. - Hi. - Hi, lesbian.
I'm 39 weeks large right now.
I can't stand for more than 60 seconds but just wanted to say I'm-I'm so excited to be raging with you all.
So bring on the cranberry juice, right?
I need this.
It's really weird.
You're acting really weird.
So many models.
I know. I know.
So many.
You can look. Don't touch.
One more thing? I am a doctor if anyone's got any areas they want... looked at.
I'm fine to take a peek. That's too much.
Don't make me call your wife.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Cece's here. Everybody assume surprise positions!
She's coming. Cece'soming.
I don't get what's happening.
I'm just gonna run upstairs and quickly grab a CD from Jess.
I'll come, too.
That's okay. I... I'll be really fast.
I want to see what your friends are like.
Have fun.
Okay.
It's gonna be great. It's just Jess.
Okay.
Bye.
I-I'll be right here.
Hey.
Whoa.
Hey, Nick. Sorry, I thought you were Jane Lynch.
Jane Lynch. Nice... nice wheels, man.
Yeah, thank you.
I'm a bit of a car man myself. Well, you know I decided to... Right on. - Good for you.
Too far!
Winston! Oh, take the car. Take the car.
I'm gonna b*at your ass with an athletic stick, boy!
Winston! Winston!
Jess said to kidnap him, so that's what I'm doing.
It's a figure of speech, you idiot.
You nervous?
Uh-huh.
Surprise!
Surprise!
It's your bachelorette party!
Jess, I...
Love it? I know.
Complete with your favorite game, Pin the Dong on the Shivrang!
Pin the dong! Pin the dong!
Oh. Hello.
Oh.
Um, Jess, this is Ankita-ji, Shivrang's aunt all the way from India.
Hello.
Ankita-ji, this is Jess, my non-blood related best friend.
Welcome... to California.
May I please use your restroom?
I need to wash my hands.
Yes, of course. It's down the hall. Um, also there's a very sexually aggressive message on the mirror and I apologize for that.
Pin the dong.
Pin it. - I can't.
Come on, Cece. Get the bull's-eye.
I haven't seen Shivrang's penis.
Oh.
It's that small?
You still know where it goes though.
It just h*t me. I'm about to commit the rest of my life to a man that I have never seen naked.
Cece, chances are he has, like, a standard garden-variety penis.
And if we're all really honest with ourselves, isn't it all about the gonads?
Am I right, ladies?
No. - No.
I'm trying to make her feel better.
And Ankita cannot hear anything about this, all right?
She will not understand. You guys have to promise to keep it G-rated tonight.
Cece, you've dreamt of this party your whole life.
I wouldn't want to change it.
No.
Really?
I can't.
Really?
I can't.
Okay.
Cece, what if it looks like an old carrot?
What if it's curly?
Oh, God.
If he's using it right, no one's seeing his penis.
Okay, I'm gonna fix this.
So, if Jess is throwing Cece a surprise bachelorette party, does that make this my surprise bachelor party?
You shut that pretty mouth of yours, Romeo, before I fill it with f*re!
Hey, you got to ease up, Winston.
I got to go.
Oh, no, no, no. No, don't.
I got a call. - Please.
I need a picture of Shivrang's penis.
d*ad Dad Pass! New topic!
Cece's really freaking out.
She hasn't seen his penis.
For the love of God, d*ad Dad Pass.
And I need it to scale, so please put, like, a nickel or a big toe or a golf pencil in there for reference.
It's not gonna happen!
One picture and you can come home.
Give me 20 minutes.
If you want to end this, we need to get a photo of Shivrang's penis.
There it is.
Cool.
Hey, Shivrang! We're liars, man!
We are throwing you a good old-fashioned American bachelor party!
Whoops!
Bachelor party! Yeah!
Whoa! Whoa Hey! What are you...
What is wrong with you?!
♪ Come on, come on
♪ Yeah... ♪
I know.
Why don't we talk about some of the things that we love about Shivrang?
I'll start. Um...
he has really good taste in magazines.
This sucks!
Boring!
So lame. - Jess, let's put in the slideshow that you made for Cece.
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
Yes! Time for p*rn cinema.
No!
Oh, my God, no!
Oh...
Oh, my God. No. Guys, guys...
How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?
Well, spoiler alert:
Women are liars.
Yeah. Yeah.
They're supposed to want commitment, right?
But then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.
I know this is awkward because we slept together, and I never returned any of your phone calls, so this might come as a shock to you, but... will you be my girlfriend?
Oh, God.
I thought you had herpes.
But no to the girlfriend, you dick.
Do you remember two years ago when we were watching coverage of the BP oil spill and doing it during the commercials and then you asked me if I wanted a serious relationship and I laughed in your face?
Well, my new answer... is yes.
Be my girlfriend!
What's that all about?
Cream cheese in bulk?
I mean, it's possible that Cece's right.
I mean, maybe I'm just not a serious relationship kind of guy.
What are you talking about?
You dated Elizabeth for, like...
for years.
Yeah.
Elizabeth?
Yeah, but Elizabeth doesn't count.
She was during my "Big Guy" period.
So you like the foot rub? Softer? Harder?
That's perfect, Big Guy.
Look at all these little toes.
All my little toesies feel so good when you rub 'em, though.
This little... this little one went to market.
If Elizabeth doesn't count, then why is it seared into my brain forever?
You were awfully salty about that.
She counts.
We need to make Cece jealous, and I don't think that's the route we want to take.
Then go to the wedding alone.
Oh.
Well, then, go with Elizabeth.
Great idea, Winston. I'm gonna ask Elizabeth.
Yeah. You were of no help to me, Nick.
That's what... my whole thing about the whole thing with Elizabeth was that I was also suggesting...
Thanks, guys.
You're an idiot, dude.
You're the worst. You guys were...
How did you know we were here?
Oh! Oh, I just couldn't decide.
Your country's refusal to embrace Robbie Williams will forever baffle me.
Well, I got to say, we're really glad you're back at the table with us, Shivrang.
Shivrung.
Let's play a classic bachelor party game right now.
Mm-hmm, all right.
I'm gonna take a photo of my junk.
Oh, no, you're not.
Yeah, I am. 'Cause this is what we do in America, Shivrang. - What?
Don't think that's much of a competition... - Oh...
I work here.
It doesn't matter.
They're not gonna f*re me.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
Okay. Yup.
Just...
That is my junk in a photo. Okay.
It's your turn, Shivrang. Take a photo of your junk.
Oh, no. No, thanks.
We're all doing it.
No, it's not... Absolutely not.
I'm begging you. - But I will get us another round of drinks.
Take the photo...
Take the picture, Shivrang.
Who fancies a shandy?
What the hell is that?
It's a drink.
Two for you guys coming right up.
Cece actually designed that toilet.
Cece was a volunteer nurse, and, um...
No bottoms?
You know, what-what happens in Orlando stays in Orlando.
Nadia, seriously, turn it off.
Cece, is this how you like to spend time with your friends?
Is this the kind of wife you want to be?
No, no. It's not at all, okay?
I didn't even know this party was happening.
It was a surprise.
I promise you, this is so not me.
I didn't want any of it.
Cece, you wanted a bachelorette party ever since I've known you.
Why do you have to pretend to be somebody you're not?
What are you saying? - I'm just saying, this is all moving really, really fast, and maybe you need to get to know Shivrang a little bit more, and maybe you need to slow this down so he can get to know you.
I'm getting married in three weeks.
Are you saying that I shouldn't get married in three weeks?
No. I'm just saying that maybe you should...
I knew it! I knew it!
You have been against this wedding from the beginning.
Fine! I don't think you should marry Shivrang if it means you have to change who you are.
Yeah, well, I don't need to take relationship advice from a girl who's in the middle of a seventh grade debacle with a boy across the hall!
Oh! - "Oh, I'm a single adult, and I kissed another
"single adult. What's gonna happen?
"Does Nick like me?
"I better go pick out a party dress.
I wear pajama sets!"
You question my pajamas, you make me question our entire friendship.
Let's say it, Jess! - You never asked me to be your maid of honor.
It's awful hot in here.
Who wants to cool down with a double scoop of Alfredo?
Not now, Alfredo!
Seriously?

But first, I have to use the bathroom.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

f*re...!
Oh!
Real f*re. This f*re is real.

Aah! It's burning so fast!
Go put it out!
You... Oh!
Look, you guys are acting really, really peculiar.
What is going on?
What is going on... is that, uh...
recently I've been one-half orphaned.
I'm sorry.
My-my dad passed away.
We orphans, man!
And it would mean the world to us ... not so much ...
if, uh...
I miss Walt so much.
If we can get a photo of your penis.
Wait. What? I'm sor...
It would help with the grieving, it would just...
For Walt, man.
All right, all right, enough!
Okay.
We need a photo for... for Cece.
Cece? - Yeah. She's freaking out
'cause she's never seen you naked.
And she's afraid it looks all funky.
So just show us that it looks regular, and we all go home.
She's freaking out?
Look, guys, I've-I've got to go.
I have... I have to talk to her.
Oh, you're... We're all in the same car. Ugh!
You know, I'm gonna take care of this.
How are you gonna take of this?
Crop, rotate, rotate... and send.
What are you doing?
I mean, this.
I just send a picture of your penis to Jess... - No!
...and told her it was Shivrang's.
No!
So now, we good.
You did not just do that.
Oh.
Shivrang.
What, Shivrang? Shivrang, what?
What?
No, nothing. It's nothing. Don't.
Oh, my God.
"Shivrang's Shiv"?
You got your idiot roommates to kidnap my fiancé to take a picture of his penis?
Well, you were freaking out!
Well, see... Three more weeks of winter.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Get out!
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I immediately regret that.
Show me!
Okay.
You are scared because you haven't seen your future husband's manhood?
Where I come from, women cry about this for days.
This is real.
This is not a dream.
Look, I've kept off the weight.
You knew me when action sandals were my necessary footwear.
What do you want? - Why do you think I want something?
Because I dated you for four years.
I know when you want something. What do you want?
I would like to take you to a wedding, because I miss you so much...
No, I can't take you seriously when you're wearing such tight pants.
Get to the point.
Okay, look, my model ex-girlfriend is getting married to some small little Indian man who I just don't understand.
Okay, and I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend so she gets very sad, and then, breaks off the wedding, and then, runs away with me.
No. Not a chance.
No?
Wait, wait, wait, please.
Elizabeth?
I'm only gonna say this once.
You were the greatest boyfriend.
I loved Big Guy.
But then, you lost weight, and you got mean.
You stopped listening to me.
You changed completely.
You stopped paying for my dinner.
Elizabeth, to be fair, at that point, you were eating the lion's share of the food.
And you were sitting there eating one basil leaf, looking like an idiot panda bear.
Well...
Look, I loved Big Guy with all my heart.
But I have no interest in helping the guy who's standing in front of me now.
I hate your hair.
And I looked, and I looked, and I couldn't find it. Where is it?
And then, I realized, uh-oh.
That is not his leg.
Oh, hey, uh, Jess, uh, please tell me...
Hey... that nobody's looked at your photos in your phone.
Um... you're too late.
Cece looked at it.
We all looked at it.
Prize hog, Shivrang.
Yeah...
I'm so sorry they made you do it.
Oh, it's okay.
Actually, it wasn't mine.
What?! - What?!
Whose was it?
It was mine.
What?! No way!
Yeah, it was, uh... Those were my privates.
Are you serious?
I'm serious. Give me my phone. I want it back now.
I have a d*ad Dad Pass. I have a d*ad Dad Pass!
No! No! It's my property!
What is going on here?
And why is Alfredo crying in the elevator?
Hello, you.
What's up, Nadia?
It's just... it's just that there's so much we don't know about each other, and I...
It's fine. That's it. I'm showing it to you.
I'm showing you my software.
No, no, no! No, no!
It's called hardware, Jack.
Yeah.
If it run, I catch it.
I mean, I don't want to see it. I do. Okay.
But not-not... not here.
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, I-I...
Sometimes it feels like we're just moving so fast, and I feel crazy that we're just...
jumping in blindly.
But maybe that's what makes this special.
It's just a real leap of faith, Shivrang.
Yeah, uh, but look, the first thing that you need to know about me is that it's actually pronounced Shivrung.
I don't know how to pronounce your name?! - No, no.
You were just so pretty, I didn't want to correct you.
But look, the most important thing is that I am gonna do my best to make you the happiest woman on the face of the earth.
Shavvy's getting nasty.
Shavvy a dog.
Shavvy?
We're friends now.
d*ad Dad Pass.
Hey.
Look, Cece...
I just wanted to say that if I was ever selfish in our relationship...
What do you mean, "if," and what do you mean, "relationship"?
That's fair. Um...
if I was...
I sincerely apologize.
So, challenge unaccepted. I don't want a plus-one.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
Good night, Schmidt.
Schmidty out.
Hey.
Hey.
I just want to say, um, I'm really sorry about...
No. I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.
And there's, uh...
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.
It's not traditional in Indian weddings to have a maid of honor, but...
I would really love it if you would be mine.
Yeah. I mean, I don't know...
What?!
Yes! Oh, my God, thank you so much for asking me!
I paid. All yours, no judgments.
Why'd you come back, Schmidt?
The Big Guy is...
Well, he's still somewhere inside this... perfect body.
He needs you to coax him out a little bit.
Please tell him what to do next.
Eat the pizza.
Eat all the pizza...
while I watch... right now.
Okay.
Oh. It's so greasy.
So many carbs.
Hey guys... Oh boy.
Welcome home, melted cheese.
Oh.
I don't even know what pepperoni's made of.
It's so good.
Is that your happy dance, big boy?
I love it.
Oh, there he is.
Yup.
There's my big guy.
It's like waking up from a bad salad dream.
♪ Big guy in the house.
Watching TV ... cool.
Cool.
Where do you think you're going? That charger belongs to all of us.
Nowhere.
Oh, really?
Because it looks like you're going to your room to charge when it's not your turn.
You know the rules, dumb-dumb.
Charger stays in a neutral room.
Why do we only have one charger anyway?
It was supposed to bring us closer together.
Hey, look, another charger.
Take him! - Get him!
Get down!
You guys get him started, I'll finish him off.
Just... so many dude butts.
Watch my face, man. That's my face.
Watch my face. Hey, that's the moneymaker.
No, I'm gonna stop him, I'm gonna stop...
Get... No!
You are terrible at this.
Oh, you can't outrun the Jewish.
That was stupid.
They are such idiots.
I don't know why I do this.
The charger doesn't even fit on my phone.
I have, like, six chargers in my room.
I just do this for fun.
It's funny.
Well, here we are by ourselves.
What should we do?
Uh, definitely not make out.
Definitely not.
Your hand's on my boob.
Yeah.
And it's weird.
Maybe it's less weird because I know that it's weird ... I'm calling it out.
Doesn't make it less weird.
Right on.
So you're an upper-boob guy.
That's the most underrated part of the boob.
It's what I've always said.
Can I ask you a question?
Please.
What's going on here?
Yeah.
What are we...?
We, us?
What are we doing? Yeah.
We are roommates, who have made out a couple of times, and are attracted to each other.
Mm-hmm.
And really good friends.
Yeah.
And sometimes genuinely kind of hate each other.
And sometimes...
touch each other's boobs.
Little bit better...
Not helping.
Little bit worse?
Yeah.

New Girl S02E21
First Date Would you describe this as a sexual act?
I would describe that as the pledge of allegiance, which can be sexual. Why?
Because this is what I got from Nick.
Just out of the blue. No reason.
Our relationship's so confusing.
But this is Nick we're talking about.
He's never gonna tell me how he feels.
It's always gonna be weird.
And I have to stop expecting for it to...
change. What?
You realize your hand is still on your boob, right?
I can't explain it, it's...
it's, like, really calming me down.
I mean, the sexual tension has been off the charts.
It's like the wild west.
No laws.
Whiskey for a nickel.
Whores caked in mud.
I don't know what to do.
You're always there when I need you, Tran.
Thank you.
I'm glad you got no life.
I'm joking. Would you settle down?
My father just d*ed.
I don't know, life's short, huh?
It just kind of...
I got to start doing things, Tran.
Making moves, grown-up moves.
I don't know, I want things. I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.
What's my move with Jess?
What would you do?
Of course you would, you dirty dog.
Well, in reality, Tran, what would do if you were me?
A date?
What if that's not what she wants?
What if she... oh!
What if she...?
All right, you're right ... no second-guessing.
I got to be confident, I've got to be clear.
Women like that.
All right, I just got to say...
Jessica, you are a beautiful woman, and my life has not been the same since I met you.
And it would mean the world to me if you would, uh...
go on a date with me.
Hey, Nick.
Jess...ica.
Dirty J, Dr. day, my toilet sister.
If so, food.
You want to get food later?
I'm gonna get dressed now.
Okay, bye.
Did you put the charger the bathroom?
The most neutral room in the loft.
Yeah, well, I moved it to the kitchen.
The kitchen?
Hey, guys.
Nick, what's more neutral?
The awesome bathroom or the stupid, stupid kitchen?
I have a lot of thoughts on this, but first, Schmidt, I have a favor.
It's about my clothes.
Burn them, burn them all.
No, no, no, no, no, I have a date tonight, and, you know, there's a lot of women who sleep with you, and I can't figure out why, so maybe it's about clothes, and maybe...
Are you asking me if I'll help you pick out clothing so you can seduce a woman?
I was.
I don't know. It's only all I've been wanting for the past ten years, Nick.
Yes, that is how you wrap a son of a bitch in wool.
Now, if somebody asks you who you're wearing tonight, what do you say? Do it, bro.
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to do that.
Do it.
I'm wearing Schmidt. Yeah.
Yeah, you are.
And neckscape by Winston.
Oh... whoa, who is that handsome devil?
Okay, now, here's some things you want to hide about yourself on tonight's date, okay?
Definitely, yeah.
That you're cheap, you're a heavy drinker, you're broke and you have a problem with anger.
Your car is horrible.
So go ahead and take my new Foscapay.
What's a Foscapay?
Uh, Ford Escape.
I'm still work-shopping nicknames.
By the way, who's the girl?
Who's the girl?
Who's the girl? Yeah.
Uh, what's her name?
It's, uh, yeah, it's, uh...
Her name is, uh, obviously Yolanda.
Uh... her last name is Winston.
I should go.
Oh, I love latino girls.
Yolanda Winston.
Schmidt, that's a fake name.
Yeah, but why would he lie about...
Oh, my God.
Nick is a male escort.
Jess...
Probably not a... Yeah.
Jess, man.
Do you realize what it means if Jess and Nick become a couple?
Nick is our glue, man. You know, without him, it just doesn't work ... it never has.
See what I mean? He's awesome, man.
This is my, one of my best friends, too.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Nick...
Nick...
All of our stories start and end with Nick.
What if Nick decides he's gonna leave us?
Well, you know what we have to do, right?
We're gonna track Jess down and k*ll her with this Kn*fe.
We have to sabotage the date.
Or we do your thing.
Let's do your thing.
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
What are you doing over there by the hot dogs?
You gave me the address, I just assumed we were eating at the hot dog stand.
No...
Why are you wearing a suit?
Did you just apply for a loan or something?
No, I'm, uh...
I'm wearing Schmidt.
You're wear... you're wearing what?
I'm wearing Schmidt, uh...
Winston shaved my face.
Weird.
Well, come on, let's get some dinner.
Come on, I got a reservation.
Come on.
What?
Hi, there, sir. Afraid, uh, you apparently didn't see the crosswalk was over there.
Oh, let's not sweat the small stuff, officer. I'm walking across the street.
Afraid I'm gonna have to write you up for jaywalking. - Stay calm, make tiny fists with your toes.
I'm really sorry about this.
Jess, I'm not upset.
This man is merely doing his job.
You were right, I was wrong.
Here you go, sir. Thank you, officer.
$340?!
Yeah, I know it's a lot. They raised it last year, I think.
Have a good night, ma'am.
All right, just scram.
You too, sir.
Dinner?
Okay.
Okay.
After you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Very lovely.
What an establishment.
It's my favorite in the city.
Right on time.
Oh...
Keep it coming.
Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?
What's on your mind?
Well, I'm just asking...
if this is a date.
What do you mean, "is this a date?"
I'm just... I'm asking you if this is a date.
It seems like a date.
You've been thinking it's a date this whole time?
I'm just asking you.
How embarrassing for you.
No, for me, it's just hanging out in a suit, getting champagne with my friend.
I think we're ready to order.
I have an idea ... I'm gonna have the bartender send over two tropical cocktails.
Jess will be all,
"Why, thank you."
Nick will be all, "Grandpa didn't get a face full of Japanese b*ll*ts just so you could drink a melted popsicle."
Or...
we could break into a zoo, steal a bear, then we sh**t that bear full of Hep C, and then we release that bear in the restaurant right when they order dessert.
Winston, you're terrible at pranks.
I get that.
You don't think just a bear alone in a restaurant is enough?
You know who would know what to do?
I do know who would know what to do.
Nick.
Nick.
We can't call him, right?
Ooh.
They have, uh, Brussels sprouts with pancetta.
That's a fancy name for bacon.
Hold the Brussels sprouts. Am I right?
Everybody loves bacon, Jess ... New topic.
You know, um...
If this were a date...
Yeah, but it wasn't, Jess...
But, I mean, if it were...
It wasn't a...
And it's probably good because your ex-boyfriend just walked into the restaurant.
Who?
The only man we both loved.
Russell.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi, so this is why you dumped me, huh?
Oh, well...
No...
Just kidding. I'm glad to see this is finally happening.
Nothing's happening, so...
Nothing's happening because I was never told it was happening, so if a happening happens and you don't know that it happened, did it happen, you know?
Right on.
Um, hey, enjoy my lucky table.
I'm Brandy.
Okay.
You know what?
Can we just forget about this date, or not-date, and...
Maybe start over and go get a drink at the bar as friends?
Drinking to forget?
That's my sweet spot.
Let's do that.
Okay.
These clothes are so uncomfortable.
Glad to get it off. In there.
You ready to drink with a friend?
I am, Jess.
Yes.
Let's do this.
Why isn't the crosswalk here?
Just let it out.
Just let it out.
This is where people want to cross, sir.
We don't need our table.
We're sitting at the bar. Not a date.
Your table's all yours ... not on a date.
I think we're doing too much brainstorming and not enough good old-fashioned remembering.
What's the worst thing that you've ever experienced on a date?
♪ I will be your father figure
♪ put your tiny hand in mine
♪ I will be your preacher teacher ♪
♪ Anything you have in mind

Outside Dave, my friend Winston here holds in his hands the lyrics to sir George Michael's
"Father Figure."
I'm familiar.
What's it gonna take for you to lose the shirt and go ruin a date for us?
We're willing to pay you handsomely.
Four million U.S. dollars and a trip to wine country.
I don't have $4 million.
All right, give him that.
I'll tell you what.
25 minutes of TV time and two home-cooked sandwiches.
One home-cooked sandwich.
Deal.
Yeah, deal.
Okay, Outside Dave.
Make yourself at home here on the couch, and I'll get started on those sandwiches...
To the laboratory!
Diversion!
Two urinals?
I'm rich!
You both have jobs.
Get another charger.
I love those guys, but they're idiots.
They are idiots.
They are so dumb.
To their credit, they don't go around randomly grabbing each other's boobs.
That we know of.
Randomly? Oh, no way.
You put it out there, Jess.
What?
Yes, you do.
I do not put it out there.
"Hey, Nick, will you help me open this jar?"
What?
Yes.
I can't open the jar.
"How do you restart the Internet?"
That's just me suffering through life.
You have to stop, because it's ridiculously hot.
Okay?
It's... hard for me to deal with,
'cause it's too hot.
All right, fine.
Then you have to stop gargling your beer.
That's a turn-on?
It's hot.
That is so weird, that that's a turn-on.
You're like...
Might as well be in, like, a...
like a hose, spraying you down.
You are out of your mind.
Hey.
Do you want to get some dinner?
Like a...
like a date?
Yeah. Let's...
Okay.
Yes! Let's do it!
We're going on a date!
Yes!
Yes!
Come on, guys.
Guys, so sorry. Curveball.
We need the table back.
We are on a date.
We are on a date.
Amazing.
Hey, Marc, could you clear the table but leave the breadsticks?
Actually, don't clear the table,
'cause that looks good.
Could you clear the fish?
I don't want to be too forward, but...
whatever baby wants, baby gets.
Daddy's buying.
Well, look, you keep buying my drinks, I'll put out no matter what you say.
Ooh.
I guess the good ones
aren't all married or gay.
How many have we had?
Ooh!
Hey, Russell!
Nice to see you!
Date's going really well.
That's... that's great news.
Really, really nice to see you guys.
Yeah.
You two are...
really something.
"Really something."
What does that mean?
Hmm.
You know, we're having a great date.
Right?
Who cares what he thinks?
Who cares what he says?
I don't... agree.
Hey! Hey, Russell!
Hey!
Oh, God. Where's my car?
Hey, you said we were
"really something..." and we want to know what that means. - What does that mean?
Yeah.
This may come as a shock, but I have no opinion about you two.
Did you valet? God, that is classy.
You know what? You can't just tell two people that they're
"really something"
and just walk away.
Fine. You-you want to know what I meant?
Yes! - You live together and you had three dates tonight.
What's that?
I think you guys don't really know what you are to each other. Right?
Well, you're wrong. No, you're wrong. Yeah.
You are wrong, because we know what we are...
We do know... yeah. We know what we are.
Okay, this'll be fun.
Tell you what. Why don't you write it down?
Seriously.
Write down what you think this is.
Is this a relationship, a one-night stand, above the waist only?
No wrong answers.
You had two pens on you this whole time?
Well, sure.
That's the move right there.
You better believe it.
This is so much better than the gutter!
I'm calling the Police, I'm calling the D.A., I'm calling somebody.
Mmm, smells like ladies in here.
Damn it. My battery's d*ad.
Yeah, mine, too. Where is the charger?
Schmidt, you put the charger back in the bathroom?
I'm sorry, okay? I thought it was the neutralest room.
Three, two, one...zero!
Let's just go, Brandy.
Wait. No, no, no, no.
Don't go. Yeah, I got it, too. Me, too.
I got this, I got this.
There it is.
Okay. Figured it out.
Good. Great. - Great.
Okay.
Y-you know what? This wasn't such a good idea.
Maybe just forget I thought of it.
We're just gonna go. All right?
Yeah. Yeah.
It's best that way.
What did you write?
What did you write?
Russell, Russell, hey.
Russell, we have to get to the bottom of this.
Okay, move it, move it.
Excuse me, sir.
The crosswalk... geez.
Sorry.
Oh, my gosh.
Hair sauce!
Hair sauce? Oh, my God.
Mmm, feels like mud.
If he even looks at my pomade caddy, I will turn every hobo in the city against him.
I will poison every pie on every windowsill.
He doesn't steal pies from windowsills.
He is a real-life homeless person.
We need to call the cops.
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't. You know why?
Yeah, your phone's d*ad.
Because of you, Schmidt.
You want to know why I'd rather hang out with Nick?
Shh. What is that?
Time to cut the grass.
He's using my four-in-one groomer.
I'm going in there.
No! Schmidt! Absolutely not!
I'm going in there, man.
You hear that? Because that... that is not the fourth use.
There's no sanctioned fifth use!
Hey, Schmidt! Schmidt!
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
He's using it for a fifth use!
Nick is gonna be home soon.
Okay? And then everything will be fine.
Nick will know what to do.
There's no time.
I'm going to the roof.
What are you... Schmidt, why are you going up...
Oh, my gosh, it's full of bugs.
Nick, I need to know how you feel.
What did you write on that card?
Well, what did you write on your card?
Let's say it at the same time, Okay.
on the count of three.
One, two, three...
Okay.
From now on, no funny business.
We do middle school dance rules.
Three feet on the floor, no body hugs.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
Great.
You got it.
Wonderful.
Really?
I...
They've got a great squish to 'em.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
Can't argue with you.
Wow, you can see my skin.
Oh, good lord.
Hot damn!
You got this.
You got this. Whoa.
What are you doing?
Stop moving.
Get off of me!
Hey, Schmidt!
He's got my leg!
Outside Dave, man, what's happening in there?
What are you d...
Schmidt!
Please! No!
He's real homeless!
No! Get off!
Come on. Come on!
If you're hurting him, I swear... oh, my...
It's shorts weather.
Everybody's gonna want to dance with you.
Well, you're going against the grain, you animal!
Is he shaving your legs?
Winston! Thank goodness! Catch me.
I got...
I was about to catch you, and then you just fell.
You just saved my life.
Anything, man, as long as you're okay.
You're okay?
Well, I don't know.
You break that whole thing down, there was...
A homeless man was just shaving my leg.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
Winston and Schmidt.
Winston and Schmidt.
All right!
Okay.
Yeah.
All right, man.
How long have the two of you been the best of friends?
Longer than we ever knew.
I will say it's hard to have a moment with you when there's a homeless dude dropping a deuce in our urinal.
We never actually ate, so...
Yeah, I know.
I'm getting a snack. I'm going to bed.
Can I have some of these?
Sure.
Jess, I can help you.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't even n... I don't even...
I don't even want...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna go to bed now.
Okay.
Don't.
I have to go to sleep.
I'll walk with you.

Yeah, but, I mean, he loved me more than he loved you.

It's not! It's not!
Hey, Uncle Nicky. Hey, man.

Sorry about that. Your brother's being a douche.

Oh, God...
You've been a douche all day.
I mean, why?
I know. I know.
You been... you been crying a bunch, buddy?
No.
He'll get your shoulder all wet, too.
Hey, look, don't do the hair-pull. It's so intimate.
NICK: You okay? JAMIE: I'm not okay!
Jamie, here's what I need you to do: Grab a bunch of kids and teach them how to build a snowman outside.
I can't do that! I already did it already!

This is getting very personal. May...
Maybe none of us should go to the funeral.
The early buzz on this thing is that it's gonna be a real drag.
So what still needs to get done? We need to, uh, get the groceries, uh, plan the funeral, call the paper...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say "plan the funeral"?
That's why you're here, Nicky.
You take care of everything.
I got the napkins!
Oh, that's so hot.
Great, Jamie.
Is Nick taking care of people?
Yeah, with Pop-Pop coming and going, Nick had to step up and be the man of the family.
Pretty much takes care of all of them.

Hmm.

Jamie, I'm begging you to shut up.
Your father always wanted to have a funeral just like Elvis had, so that's what we're gonna give him.
A funeral like Elvis had?
That means...
12 white limos and an Elvis impersonator...

So tell me what needs to get done, and I'll just do it.
Oh, the eulogy.
You...

You should do it. Do a good poem. Do one of your good ones.
BOBBY: Come on, man. You got to.
Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll, uh...
That's my boy.
He takes care of everything.
Hey.
Hey, Jess.
It's like a whole secret life for you.
You're not even looking at the numbers.
Aunt Ruthie used to call this the Iron Jew.
Wow.
(Chuckles)
Are you having time to process this?
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out the level of Elvis impersonator we can afford.
Uh-huh.
And I think a white one's out of reach.
Is there anything I could do to help?
The eulogy.
Sorry?
Oh, that would be really helpful 'cause that's been getting in my way a little bit.
I didn't really know your dad except...
the one hour that I committed fraud with him.
That's all there is to know, really.
I think that's, you know, one task I think maybe is better if you...
Look, I've got to figure out an Elvis theme.
You know, Elvis-themed flowers and food and music all in a day.
I just... You asked if there was anything you could do, and there is.
Okay.
Yay! Thank you.
I'll do it.
Yeah.
Oh, you are the best.
Hey, Nick.
Yeah.
For Elvis-themed music, what about Elvis?
I'm really... I'm so slammed right now.
I can't hear, like, new stuff.
WINSTON: Looking good, man. This was Walt's best suit.
Look at all these buttons, Winston.
I look like a remote control.
It looks good.
I can't mourn in this.
I don't even know how to use these buttons.
Hey, look, we're not mourning, okay?
This is a celebration, you know? That's what funerals are about...
Winston, I just can't go to the funeral, okay?
I don't want to go!
What the hell is the problem?
Look, I really want to support Nick. I do.
I want to support his family.
I want to be there for him, but...
I'm scared of death.
Uh... wow. Uh...
Schmidt, you know, death is natural, you know?
It's a natural part of life. Everybody's scared of death.
Death, Winston.
(Whispering):
Death. Death.
And let me ask you something, Winston:
What's with this open casket thing?
All of a sudden, I-I got to walk in and I got to see the carcass?
That's crazy.
What if... what if his eyes open?
What if his eyes open, and then he comes and haunts all of us? Why do... Why...
Literally, why are the buttons on here?
Because they're not holding anything together, yet I don't know which buttons are buttoned.
How do you get this thing off, Winston?!
I don't understand this middle-class button system!
Get it off of me!
(Panting)
So I don't think I'm gonna go to the funeral, man.
I think I'm gonna hang back.
So, um, I'm helping Nick with the eulogy.
I'll give you the goods on Walt, Glasses Face.
My pop had a table at every diner in the city.
He had silverware from the finest hotels in the area.
He had a gold chain as thick as floss.
But, like, thick floss.
Wait, Walt's got that chain?
Yeah, he got that chain. That's his chain.
That was my dad's chain.
No, it was Walt's signature piece.
No, he got that from the Seiko watch deal.
No, he got it from the dishwasher arrangement.
No, he didn't. JAMIE: Yes, he did.
My dad took a dart in the eye for that.
I don't care what your dad took a dart in the eye for.
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Can we refocus? JAMIE: I can't!
Because he's accusing my father of thievery! - Hey!
Can we just talk about Walt? JAMIE: Yeah, so what's the deal with you and Nick? Are you guys, uh...
Could you...
could you stop doing that with your eyebrows?
Please stop doing... Stop.
They're doing it. They're doing it.
Yeah.
No.
Whoever denied it supplied it.
Now, this would be the casket.
(Sighs)
And now I'm d*ad.
So approach me and don't be afraid.
Just promise not to move, all right?
That's what I'm afraid of most.
Are you k... are you kidding me?
Also, you can't breathe.
Schmidt, I need to breathe, okay?
Because I'm coaching you, and also for regular life reasons.
Now, just calm down, find a joyful memory and let it lift you to the sky.
(Exhales)
(Sighs)
You left us too soon, you beautiful black butterfly.
Start over.
You know, when we first met, I thought that we would be rivals.
For Nick's attention, for who wore Easter colors best.
And then rivalry became friendship.
(Chuckles)
We've laughed, we've swum.
You cut my toenails.
Are you the brother that I never had?
No.
You're the brother that I've always had.
That was beautiful.
(Shouts) What are you doing, man?!
You moved! Whoa! What the hell?
Of course I moved! I'm not a real d*ad person!
You ghoul!
Why do I do this for you?
Forget it, man. I'm never going to this thing.
You just made it worse.
What's wrong with you?
$2,000?
What if it wasn't six feet under?
How much for three feet?
I've gone through half a pack of ciggie gum here.
You want some of my weed?
Where are we on the food?
We-we got to have Elvis food.
Ma, I'm making calls right now.
It's got to be perfect.
It's gonna be perfect. You just got to let me do it. - If the food isn't Elvis-themed, does it matter that much?
You got a problem with Elvis?
I don't... (Stammers) - No, she didn't say that. I'm gonna have to call you back.
No, she didn't say that. She didn't say that about Elvis. - I was just suggesting that maybe the Elvis theme doesn't matter as much...
You don't think Elvis is important?
She knows Elvis is important, Ma!
Elvis is everything!
I know. He's the King. He's the King.
I'm sorry, Bonnie. He's the King.
Jess.
Nick...
I'm here to help, but I can't write this eulogy. - Wait, what?
Do you want some of my weed? NICK: I asked you to do one thing.
I need you to write the eulogy.
But I didn't know Walt.
Nobody wants to hear what I have to say about my dad.
It doesn't matter what you say. You just... you h...
you have to say good-bye to him.
I'm not asking you to do too much.
Just write my father's eulogy.
I can't handle this!
JESS: Nick. BOBBY: My dad's chain!
JESS: Nick. BOBBY: I want that chain!
JAMIE: Hey, Nick! Nick! He popped me right in my cherry!
That's not what that means, Jamie!
JAMIE: Then what does it mean?! JESS: Nick!
Where are you going?
(Door shuts)
I forgot my jacket. It's really cold outside!
JESS:
Nick, wait!
JAMIE: Ow!
(Organ playing)
Hey.
Hey.
When's the last time you saw Nick?
Is he not here?
What are you guys talking about?
Schmidt, if you want to hear what we're saying, come over here.
Don't shout across the room.
It's bad luck to see the body before the funeral.
No, that's, like, a wedding thing, Schmidt.
Shh.
I think I said something to Nick.
I think this is my fault.
Hey, everybody! I brought Elvis!
NICK: Funeral saved. WINSTON: What?
Hey, happy funeral, Jess.
What happened?
What happened is I found this guy at the bar and he fits into the costume, so for 20 bucks, he's gonna be Elvis.
I thought you wanted me to k*ll Elvis for 20 bucks.
Then why would I give you the outfit, Brendan?
The element of surprise?
(Chuckling): Yeah.
The mirror effect?
He's gonna be perfect.
Mmm.
Whose birthday is it?
No, it's my dad's funeral.
I'm gonna go find cake.
How much have you had to drink?
One dozen beers. And I wrote...
I did what you asked me to do, Jessica.
I wrote the, uh, gigleography.
The what?
The gigleography.
A "gigleography"?
Urology.
Elegy? Eulogish.
You wrote the eulogy.
That's what I've been saying the whole time ... it's right here.
"Walt Miller. Am I right?"
Am I right? Am I right?
That's terrible.
Googaliogy!
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna sober up Nick and... and Elvis.
You, go buy us some time.
All right, Schmidt, stop asking people if they can smell the body. That is rude. - I'll try.
It's inappropriate and it's offensive, okay?
Okay, but I just...
All right? It's what I...it's what I'm thinking.
I got this. Shh. I got this.
Just don't say anything, okay? Come on.
Hi...
Uh... the chain.
Some... someone should stop...
'Cause he's taking the chain.
Hey, hey, quit it, man.
Don't do that.
Hey, b*at it, Cali.
Long Island, son.
I don't care.
Get off of it, man.
Just stop it. Stop it.
You touching me? You touching me?
Yeah, I'm touching you.
You don't touch me.
I don't want to go near that.
You don't touch me!
Quit it.
Do you want to go?
(Stammers)
Come on, do it. Come on, come on.
Here we go.
Get away from Walt's chain, man!
I'm just saying...
I... n-no! N-n-n-n-no!
Please, no, no, no, no! No!
Desecration!
Shut up.
(Shouts)
Shut up.
There's no desecration.
Don't interrupt me.
That's my dad's chain, and I'm taking it.
Shut your mouth.
What's wrong with you?
(Whispering):
Bobby, shut up.
Dude, he's d*ad. What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Ooh!
What are you doing?
I'm not afraid.
Not afraid of what? I'm not afraid.
I can do this.
I can do this all day.
Come on, don't do that.
All day, son.
Come on, don't-don't put your head in there.
Don't put your head in there, all right?
All day.
Dude, that's my uncle. SCHMIDT: Come get your chain, Boston!
What? All day!
All day! All day!
All day!
I don't need it.
I don't want it.
What's up!
I know you told me to write it, but I couldn't.
I didn't have anything to say.
You're mad at me.
You've got the mad face.
I'm not mad at you, Nick.
I'm not mad at you.
I have your back.
No matter what, no matter how stupid it gets, and...
you and I both know it can get really, really stupid.
I am the stupidest of all the stupid boys.
No.
I'm gonna be there, and I'm gonna hold your hand, and I wanted to tell you that last night, but you ran away.
Yeah.
(Loud grunt)
(Grumbles, sighs)
I want to meet your mom.
JESS:
Oh, my God.
Hey, Elvis!
What are we going to do, Winnie?
Everyone's waiting.
Mrs. Miller, how about I just go up there and I say a few words?
Keep it light, keep it happy.
Right.
Don't mention the felony thing.
Or Paraguay, or the storage space.
Hey, y'all.
Ah...
Now, some of y'all know me.
I am Winston.
And I look at today as a celebration.
So let's have a party. MAN: That's right.
You know, because a party is what Walt would have...
(Clearing throat)
(Choking up):
A party is...
a party, uh...
(Sobs)
Walt would have wanted us to have a party. WOMAN: Oh, dear.
(Winston grunts)
(Groans)
(Quietly):
I can do this.
I can do this, I can do this.
(Wails)
(Wailing sobs)
Oh, Walt!
I can't do this no more, Walt!
(Winston wails)
(Wailing continues in distance)
Hey. You done with this?
Hey! What's going on?
(Gasps)
(Groans)
This is Elvis?
No...
This funeral's going down the toilet.
I promised Walter it'd be beautiful and full of life.
I promised.
I'm sending everyone home.
Wait. Bonnie.
Are you tapping me on the shoulder, girlie?
Let me make this totally clear.
I don't want you here.
I don't know you.
I don't know your people.
You tap me twice?
I... please wait for Nick.
It's important.
Then why is he not here?
No eulogy? No Elvis?
I'd rather not have a funeral if it's not gonna honor my husband.
(Brendan groaning)
(Mumbles):
And I'm out.
(Clears throat)
I want to thank you for coming, but it's, uh, over now, so...
(Crowd murmuring)
JESS (Imitating Elvis):
Stop the funeral!
Everybody sit down.
This is the King.
What the hell?
I think you mean...
"What the heaven?"
Mama.
It's Elvis.

Thank you, Jess.
You're welcome, Mama.
Oh...
(Sighs)
(Exhales)
I used to always tell my dad that I hated Elvis just to piss him off.
And he would get really mad the way Walt could get really mad.
And, uh, he would turn it up loud just to spite me and sing all the Elvis songs.
He was very good at gambling.
(Chuckles)
He had a great mustache.
(Sobs)
Hey, man.
What?
And he was so mean to cabbies in such a cool way.
And he never was scared.
(Sniffles)
How did he do that?
(Sighs)
I don't know if Walt was...
a good guy or a bad guy in the whole scheme of things, you know.
But he was my dad, and I'm sure gonna miss him.

BOBBY: You owe me a gold chain, or at least the price of a gold chain.
Or maybe just a giant lobster. It's all about the gesture, and I will get my gesture.
My face touched the mustache of a carcass today, Bobby.
I'm not afraid of you.
I got some advice for you:
Stay out of Boston.
What, you gonna keep me out of the whole city?
I work TSA at Logan.
I'll put a g*n in your luggage.
Why do you got to bring w*apon into it, Bobby?
Hey, wh-where do you think you're going with that hat?
Bonnie, I just really wanted something to remember him by.
Uh-huh. Empty your pockets.
Okay, look, all I got is this fishing wire and a Wrigley ticket stub with a button, and then there's the...
there's the leg to his favorite chair, and there's the...
Come.
You keep it all.
Hey, Bonnie.
Oh, sorry.
Mm-hmm.
I almost tapped you.
(Laughing): You scare me.
(Laughs)
Pretty fun weekend all in, though, right?
I packed you a snack for the trip.
Oh.
Cheese puffs.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Come here.
Oh...
Ooh.
JAMIE: Oh, hey, Nick?
Yeah?
How far away you are from getting married?
I don't know.
'Cause, uh, you know, DeAnn and I were thinking about getting married, so...
Jamie, you know, brothers don't have to get married in order.
DeAnn, we're doing this!
Hey, I couldn't find the, uh, cat.
I looked all over, but I just decided to clean out the litter box.
I... owe you an apology.
What are you talking about?
We all depended on you so much, and you were just a kid.
Don't do this, Ma.
I'm just saying.
You're going through enough.
I'm glad you have someone who takes care of you.
I love you, Ma.
Visit more.
So I don't have to talk to your brother all the time.
(Chuckles)
She said yes!

Schmidt, that is melon-flavored liquor.
It's 4 proof, okay? That is safe to drink while you're pregnant.
Melon b*lls.
Schmidt, no matter how much you get drunk, Cece's still gonna be engaged.
Cece?
Now, I know you're down about it.
I'm not down about Cece.
This is, this is a mess. - Listen, there are plenty of things to be down about:
The air pollution in China, the deficit,
The Hobbit wasn't very good. If I want to see dwarves in a real-time dinner scene, I would've gone to Koreatown. Booyah! Ball me.
Ball you?
Ball me!
What are you...
How do you get these toppy things off, Nick?
Oh, Schmidt... You look like a lab rat.
Okay, you know what?
I'm adding that to your bill.
What the hell is this?
What?! You're giving us a check?
No more free drinks.
I didn't even know you had these here.
Take all of my money and then get out of my room.
You guys, come on.
Show a little respect. This is my job.
Nick, I saw you pee in the register.
Yeah, once.
You think I was sober for that?
You once put a sign out that said
"Take a Drink, Leave a Drink."
Okay, it's the only job I have, and I'm trying to be... good.
Okay? It's about time I got a little responsibility.
Responsibility?
I thought of a new promotion ... it's like Ladies' Night but it's the opposite:
It's Guys' Night.
The new manager loved the idea, and if it goes well ...
Maybe there's a promotion;
I can start moving up in the world.
What?
I want him.
I want him... bad.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
What is this?
I think Nick being ambitious and driven about the bar is making me...
want him more. Is that, like, a thing?
No. No woman's ever been attracted to power and success.
It's just like...
I thought it was one kiss and then it was over.
Hey, sorry, I'm just putting a load on.
Got a shift at the bar.
You know that there's a separate compartment to put the soap in?
I didn't know that.
Little soap house.
Anyway, I'm getting this mess cleaned up.
I gotta say, it feels really good.
Do any of you guys know where the iron is?
Get out!
What? I want to iron my button-down.
Get out, Nick!
What is happening right now?
Get out!
Why are you being so mean to me?
Get out!
What is going on with you?
There's a new manager; That's why I'm making you guys pay.
And you actually care about what he thinks?
Hey, Shane.
Hey.
Hey, guys. This is Shane. This is my new manager.
Oh, got it.
I'm really excited to have her here.
We're really getting this place in order. We're, uh...
Makes a lot more sense now.
God, I can't stop thinking about the other night.
Hope you gave that bar an extra wipe-down.
Yeah.
You're just like the opposite of everyone I went to business school with.
I mean, look at you. You're just... You're so real. - Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He's incredibly real.
As real as they get.
Yeah, the realest.
Shut up, both of you.
You're a mess.
Yeah. - I got dirt on my face after we made out.
God, I loved it. Get back to work.
You got it.
Get back to work!
I'm joking. No, but seriously, Yeah. Joke. Seriously, get back to work. Yeah.
Get back to work. Yeah.
I know this isn't gonna end well, but the whole middle part's gonna be awesome.
Good for you.
What?
Schmidt, stop drinking that.
I'm gonna take care of this.
If I feel down, I come here.
I love this place, man. You know, the sound of bubbles, soothing synth music.
If this place doesn't take your mind off of Cece, then I don't know, man.
Look at that.
So beautiful.
And exotic.
Perfect curves.
Giant almond eyes.
Caramel-colored stripes.
Sumptuous lips.
Are you talking about the fish?
Excuse me. You, sir, that works here.
What is this fish ... the one that floats like an angel?
How much for this one?
Ah, that is the lovely but elusive California lionfish.
It's perfect. I must have it.
S-Sadly, sir, you can't.
What do you mean I can't?
It's... illegal, sir.
This fish is protected by the great state of California.
Gimme it!
No...?
What are you doing? Why can't I have the things that I want?
Sorry about that.
Don't look at the fish, kids.
You can't have any of them!
None of them are for sale!
Love is a lie. It is.
Calm down!
Love is a lie. Love is a lie.
We're leaving. We're leaving.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Schmidt, no. Absolutely not.
No! I don't trust fish.
They breathe water ... that's crazy.
Yeah, he's got a whole thing going.
Schmidt ... an aquarium?!
When did you become a Bond villain that couldn't afford not to live with roommates?
This is where I will keep my lionfish.
Your lionfish?
A rare beauty.
The result of generations of interracial fish breeding.
Just undulating in that water with that wry smile.
Perfect, round fish breasts.
Pull it together.
What is this hat?
They say it'll be impossible for me to have it.
But I'll get it. She will be mine, and...
we will create a life together.
We're not talking about fish here, are we? - No.
Clearly talking about Cece.
Yes.
Yeah, 'cause he said
"fish breasts."
He said "fish breasts."
Yeah.
I mean, fish don't have boobs.
Hmm?
Hey, Jess.
That's my name. What's yours?
Just kidding. I know what it is. It's Nick.
You okay?
Yeah.
You haven't stopped moving
since we've been talking.
Hmm?
It's a nice-looking dress. You look good in it.
Oh, God. Okay.
Jess! Jess, wait!
Jess... Jess, would you please wait?
Hey, I was wondering, can I get a ride to the hardware store?
I want to throw a punching bag up at the bar for Guys' Night, but my car's not working, so can I get a ride?
No. Mm-mm. No.
Come on, can I please have a ride?
Wait, hold on. Don't move. Hold on.
You got an eyelash.
Why do you smell so good?
It's 'cause I did laundry.
Ah. I smell like a baby in a damn meadow.
Look at this. My underwear.
What? What?
-They're blue now. I think it's 'cause I put colors in the whites. - Uh-huh.
I'm still figuring it out, but I'm really excited about laundry.
Good job. - Hey, how do you put your underwear back in?
Just... I feel like it's too big to get back in now.
It's tricky to get it in.
Fine!
Thank you.
Do you mind if we stop along the way? I'm thinking of getting a salad 'cause I want to eat healthier.
Oh! God! Nick!
I'm thinking of taking a vitamin today.
Oh, God! Shut up!
It's good.
Yeah.
Yank that chain.
Yank it.
I feel like Russell Crowe in every movie he's ever done.
All right, Nick. Um, we have to go.
We just got here.
We have tons of stuff we need to get. - Fine.
Let me see what we have left.
A whole bunch of stuff.
Long-shafted... drive drill?
New nut wrench?
Our old nut wrench is bad.
Quick-hardening... caulk.
You don't want to wait forever for that caulk to harden.
Lube for... drill shaft.
And we ... also, can we get a box of gummy sharks?
Just remember... you caught him pleasuring himself to a mail-order steak catalogue.
Hey, Jess, I need the cart!
Look what I found!
Look at this big ol' pipe.
Check it out, Schmidt ... I got you a clownfish.
I don't want some janky freshwater bitch fish, Winston.
I want a lionfish.
Let's just cut through the crap, okay, Schmidt? We both know what you really want is Cece.
Cece the woman?
Yeah.
You can't put a woman in a fish t*nk, Winston.
That doesn't make any sense.
Look, Winston, if there was one thing that stood between you and happiness, don't you think I would be there to help you get it?
No matter how stupid it was?
You're right, Schmidt.
If I was doing something stupid, you definitely would be involved.
Yeah, you're damn right I would be.
And I would probably be there to make it even stupider.
Now, I'm going to walk out that door, and I'm gonna pursue the object of my dreams.
And if you don't want to join me, then I'm gonna carry that weight alone.
I'm in.
Let's get you a lionfish. Where do we start?
We're gonna start at the source.
The ocean.
That's an even better idea.
Hey, Jess.
I got some hot soup.
I feel good...
Jessy feel good...
Mmm.
I like to say words with my mouth.
Well, your jaw is super bruised, so you need to get some rest. But you have some fun pain meds.
Right?
I like you.
Yeah, I like you, too, Jess.
Yeah... and I like, your little bubble belly.
Oh, thank you.
bl*ws up like a... bubble.
Yeah, that's what it does.
I want to have sex with you!
Okay.
I want to have sex with you.
Whoa, do you know what you're saying right now, Jess?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I want to have sex with you.
Sexy time for you, says me.
You are a beautiful white man, Nick Miller.
Okay.
Read all about it.
Yeah.
I'm Judy Garland.
Yeah, so it's the pills.
This is nonsense.
Whoa! Jess, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no...
Heck, no... no...
Don't do this right now.
I'm Judy Garland.
Hey, Judy, let's get you to bed, doll.
Whoa, whoa! You are way too drugged-up for this... okay...
This little piggy went to the market.
That little piggy can't be touched by you right now. - This little piggy went... ... this little piggy went to market!
It's hot! I put my hand in the hot soup!
Ow! You... aah!
Hey, Nick!
Will you be a doll and get me some mustard?
That is not flattering on you.
You're an incredibly lovely man.
Are you calling my phone?
Yeah, I'm calling it right now, Winston.
I can't find it.
Are you kidding me?
Damn it, Winston!
It took me 20 minutes to fit this thing over your hips.
Whoa, okay. Hey! Hey!
Careful! Hey! What are you...
Why is your waist so weird?
That's my ass cheek! Sch-Schmidt!
I'm getting your phone.
That kind of tickles.
Hey! Stop saying "That's my ass cheek" and stop touching his butt!
Look at that shiner.
Not cool!
Somebody messes with my boy, that means we mean "bid-ness"!
We doing this? Let's do this!
Are we not... are we not doing it? It doesn't feel like you guys want to do it.
Let's just say hypothetically that a girl says something to you while she's on painkillers.
Mm-hmm.
And that girl says that she might want to have sexual intercourse with you.
Please tell me we're not talking about Jess.
And you had no idea that's how she felt.
Like, no idea. You thought the door was closed.
In fact, you thought that door was so closed that you went out to another door, but had I known that the first door was open, that's the door I wanted to walk through.
Wait, okay, wait...
I would've walked through that door.
Do you see how I'm in a tough spot?
Can we stop calling it
"walking through a door"?
Because for me, I feel like it's more like sliding past a drape.
Okay, if a girl on painkillers says that she wants to have sex with you, Mm-hmm.
is that the drugs or is that real?
And if so, how do I end it with Shane before Jess finds out?
I-I-I meant the door.
Nick, Jess...
All right, good talking, guys.
Good stuff. Yeah, I love that.
Hey, guys.
What happened to your eye?
You smashed me in the face, remember?
Right here.
That's funny.
Seriously, what happened?
Is your jaw okay? I bit my face.
Oh, you know what?
I can't even feel it.
The doctor's got me so goofy on these painkillers, it's like it never happened.
It's like it never happened.
But I sure got a chin shiner.
Yeah, you do.
Right?
So, I'll see you at Guys' Night.
Uh, no, no, no, you...
I don't...
I think you should rest.
Yeah, girl, you gotta protect that face.
Yeah, hey, for real, you should stay home and you should rest, Jess.
That's so sweet.
Thanks, guys.
What are doing out here?
This is crazy.
We've been standing in the ocean for two hours trying to steal an illegal fish.
I don't know why you want that damn fish so bad.
But what I do know is that it's gonna make you happy.
And that's all I care about.
Remember, I'm the one who shaved your shoulders after you got that scoop-neck sweater.
I appreciate it.
I'd do the same to find whatever it is that makes you happy.
You want to lose that last 55 pounds, I'll help you do that.
I don't got 50 pounds to lose.
It's very evident in this outfit.
Right there. I see something.
Lionfish!
Son of a...
What the...?
Jellyfish!
What?
Jellyfish!
Whoa, Schmidt.
Jellyfish!
What happened?
It got me, it got me!
What do I do?
What do I do?
It got me, Winston!
It burns!
Okay!
Burns!
So what do I do?
I need you to pee on my face.
What?
You need to pee on my face.
I can't.
It will sterilize the wound. Please do it, Winston.
I can not pee on your face.
I thought you were with me to the end.
I just peed in the ocean, so I'm all out.
You peed in the ocean?
Yeah, look...
Disgusting!
Okay, look, look, I know this is a dumb question, but will number two help?
What?
Free beers, Gorilla Bowl of nachos.
Gonna be two dozen dollars, boys.
Didn't realize we could make a $22 profit on nachos.
Guys' Night is genius.
Right?
Hey, um, look, uh, I think you're great, I just, uh, I can't keep...
I can't keep running to get cheese every time somebody orders nachos.
I love how worked up you get over cheese.
Get down there. Run.
Ooh...
who do I have to do around here to get a bucket of nachos?
Right here. Right here. How you doing?
I wasn't serious.
Wendell. Hi.
Gentlemen... There's a really literal vibe around here.
What are you doing here?
This morning you said you weren't coming, Jess.
I actually don't remember this morning at all.
But I would never miss this. I'm so proud of you. - Free beers!
Free beer.
You guys went through those!
Wait a minute...
More free beers.
Guys' Night is men drink for free?
Well, it's Guys' Night.
Oh.
You know...
I...
it's not a really good idea.
You know, because women won't show up, and...
You know?
He's our little idea man.
Hey...
So full of ideas.
She just slap your ass?
Sure. She's like a...
she's my boss and like a coach.
We're a team here.
We all slap each other's butts all the time.
Right here! Keep up the good work!
Why don't you go get us some ice, Big Bob?
Just slap my butt, Big Bob.
Show me some butt love.
f*re me off!
Some butt love?
Take a slice of that.
Oh, you got right up in there.
Hey, hey...
Oh, Shane, Shane, Shane...
Wait...
Is she...?
No.
Uh, yeah.
Are you...?
No. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're sleeping together.
So what?
We're all sleeping together.
Big Bob is...
I'm sorry, Jess.
Why... I mean, why are you sorry?
You're a free man.
Just... you're just... you know...
getting some t*nk on it.
Did you really just say that to me in my own bar?
Nick, who is this?
Yeah, Nick, who am I?
Shane, this is Jess.
She's my, uh...
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hmm... my room... friend.
I'm your "room friend," Nick?
Jess, don't...
I'm sleeping with Nick, too.
You don't have to do this, Bob.
I have to go.
Big Bob, that was really sweet.
Thank you, Bob!
Jess, wait!
Hey, hey.
What are you doing here?
He left me a voicemail from the ambulance.
He was rambling a lot, but I brought him this.
Whoa, where'd you get that?
You know, one of the perks of being a model.
You get to meet a lot of sketchy people.
The guy who got me this also said he could get me a box of dolphin steaks or a mostly white baby.
Good to know.
How's he doing?
Uh, hey, listen, I think it might be good for him if you just gave him some space.
Space?
Cece, you're getting married.
It's k*lling him.
Okay.
Yeah.
Um, just tell him I came...
Mm-hmm.
...by, or... or not.
Uh-huh.
He's waking up. You should go.
Okay.
You know... roommate.
Winston.
Hmm?
I just realized something.
It was never about a fish.
It was a metaphor.
It was about Cece.
Don't feel bad about not seeing it.
Look, man, it was subtle as hell.
Oh, my God, is that a lionfish?
Where'd that come from?
The...
The lion... the lionfish?
You. That came from you.
When the paramedics came, you...
you had it in your hand.
They were like, "Whoa, you can't get one of these."
And I was like,
"He caught it in a..." You did it.
Hello, fish Cece.
Gonna put you back in the sea.
I'm sorry, what? Look, Winston, I don't know if it was the jellyfish's venom or the paramedic's urine, but it made me realize...she's not mine to keep.
She belongs out there.
In the great, wide open ocean.
Uh, Schmidt, that don't go to the ocean.
What are you, the city planner?
Hi.
Well, I've got some explaining to do.
Shut up.
I'm really happy her name is Shane.
Mm... mm-hmm.
Who's next?
Cody?
Tex? The sheriff?
Mm.
Hey, Jess...
last night, when you were on pills...you said you want me.
Shut up.
You put your hand in my pocket.
No, I didn't...
You said, "This little piggy wants to go to the market."
Shut up, Nick.
It's something you were just saying, that's fine, that's cool, we'll move on and not talk about it, but it is something that I've thought a lot about.
But you were never clear about that, so that there were other options.
And this little piggy ran around to different markets, but he didn't know.
What are you talking about?
Do you want to have sex with me, yes or no?
Yes!
No! Yes! I mean, I did.
But that was before I knew that you were... you were doing all that for your boss, so you sleep with her.
Fine, forget-forget the boss.
Okay.
Well, I just, you know, I thought it was...
it was nice to see you actually trying at something.
So...
That's why you were more attracted to me?
Wait a second.
I thought it was attractive that you were trying.
That's why?
You're a frickin'
gold digger, Jess.
What?!
I think that's what you just said.
If I were a gold digger, do you think I'd be interested in you?
I would be the worst gold digger in the world.
You're a friggin' gold digger.
No, I'm not, Nick.
I'm so disappointed in you.
Shut up!
I'm not a gold digger.
Then prove it.
Ow! My jaw.
What?
Then move your damn head.
Then kiss me like a man!
Damn it!
What's wrong with your hand?
I burnt it in your damn soup. Is that what you wanted...
Well, who burns their hand in soup?
I do!
You're a mess!
You are so annoying with your little shorts.
Why are you so angry all the time?
I told you, shut up.
Shut up and take off your clothes right now.
And I mean it, take off your clothes.
You're just chaotic. Everywhere you go.
Stop talking!
Wherever you go! You are ...
-This is not the time to talk, that is the stupidest thing...
Oh...
I'm gonna grab some paper towels.
An aquarium the size of a sixth grader just broke, and you're grabbing paper towels?
Yes, I'm getting paper towels.
What are you thinking?!
Okay, you know what?
I'm out. - You can't clean this up with paper towels.
I'm not...
You don't want to clean it up.
No, that's not what it is.
Well, you know what?
If you're not cleaning it up, I do not want to be told...
I'm not cleaning it up.
...what to do, by you, right this second!
I'm not... just 'cause I'm a woman?
That's it! I'm out!
Please.
You piss me off!
This is a bad idea.
I know you're going out into the ocean lionfish, but...
I ever see you again, then...
well...
And should you meet a charming...
physically fit, what ... I don't know, whatever kind of fish gefilte fish come from...
Treat him well.
Be careful.
You gotta be kidding me!
-Oh, sh**t.
Stay alive!
Stay alive!
Cece!
This month marks Nick and my ten year anniversary of living together.
Our "tin" anniversary.
Ten years? You guys are like Bert and Ernie.
I got dibs on Bert.
Dibs on Ernie.
Nice.
Cool, man. All right.
Yeah, man.
Now, obviously, we're going to have an anniversary party.
You guys are invited.
I'm not sure if I'm coming to that, man.
Remember the "wood" anniversary?
Ah!
You cut me!
Well, happy anniversary!
I gotta get a tourniquet.
Hold some more wood for me.
Yeah!
Well, it wasn't as bad as paper.
Happy anniversary!
Paper!
Party time, man.
Did you know that the chemical symbol for tin is SN?
Schmidt and Nick.
What?
Is no one else's mind bl*wn by this?
That's it, our theme is TinFinity.
TinFinity. That's actually really good, Schmidt.
Yeah, it is.
I really don't think two men who live together for ten years need a party.
Why must you always be like this?
Because you never let me participate in the planning.
I would love for you to participate.
Gah! That was a trick. I was trying to get out of it.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪
They're celebrating
ten years of living together?
Why are we friends with these guys, Jess?
I...
What happened?
It's so weird to think that Nick is the last person I kissed.
Actually, Schmidt's the last person I kissed.
Okay, what?
It was nothing. Nick was watching.
What is happening in this loft?
Ooh, girls chatting.
Hey, Nick.
I wish I knew what was going on inside Nick's head.
He's this, like, grumpy mystery.
Jess, are these open for anybody?
Yep.
Right on, thank you.
He can't communicate a feeling to save his life.
But why can't I stop thinking about his mouth on my mouth?
Hey, Jess, do I have frosting on my lips?
Look at my mouth ... do I have frosting on it?
Wh-Why are you asking me this?
My mouth feels moist and weird.
Do I have anything on it?
Get out of here! Ugh! Aw...
Okay, you know what?
You need what I needed. You need a new guy, all right?
Dating Shivrang helped me get past all the weird stuff with Schmidt.
I need the Anti-Nick.
Yeah.
I need a real man, who can express his feelings, and I need a different mouth on my mouth.
To erase that mouth.
No, you actually
don't need to wash raw denim.
Haven't washed my pants in 18 months.
Also, I'm bisexual.
Microchips be gettin' small.
They be, like, blueberry size.
So you could put 'em in your cereal, girl.
I don't get your thing.
It's prescription.
Damn it.
What happened to the guys in this bar?
They open up a bus station next door?
Where are the real men?
I can't talk right now.
I'm writing a strongly-worded e-mail to my florist.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, look at the door, don't look at the door, look right now, don't look, one at a time, look, but don't look. Guys, one at a time.
Don't look now.
Look. No, you're both looking.
I don't know what to do.
I'm confused.
Look right now at the door. Go.
Oh...
that is a strapping young man.
That is Jax McTavish.
He plays safety for San Francisco.
Why's he with Winston?
Winston looks so cool.
What up, guys?
Oh, "What's up, guys."
You're just gonna walk over and say, "What's up, guys?"
Winston, does he think you're Omar Epps?
You guys talking about Jax?
Look, I interviewed him at the radio station, and we just h*t it off.
It's not a big deal, you know, unless you think hanging out with a pro baller is a big deal.
His hands are so big and warm.
I want to fall asleep in them, like Thumbelina.
How about, uh, introducing me?
Yeah, okay. You and Jax?
Yeah.
Jess and Jax McTavish.
Great bit, Jess.
What a dumb idea.
Do it.
No.
You can't handle that kind of thunder.
Hell, no.
Jax and I are just becoming friends.
I'm going over there.
Jess, no, Jess.
Guys...
Hey, Jess, let me show you something. Hmm?
It's right here.
Hi, I'm Jess. I'm Winston's roommate.
How you doing?
I'm Jax.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Jess, stop it, stop it.
Cool, so I hear you play for San Francisco. - I do.
7.8 tackles, man, I can't believe you didn't go to the Pro Bowl.
Here's my question:
What's a "point-eight" tackle?
Did you know I'm a teacher?
What would you teach me?
Nick... the theme is
"masculine garden party."
Look at that ... I made a graph.
I thought you said I was gonna help you plan it.
Nick, we both know that you're not very good with party chores.
You sent out the invitations, right?
Me?!
I sent them out?
Okay, I'm older now. I am wiser.
I want to help plan my own party.
Okay, fine, I will give you balloons...
Oh, sweet, balloons are...and Porta Potties. Porta Potties?!
That sounds like a job for babies.
Does that look like a job for babies?
Oh, so this is a big job?
I thought you were being disrespectful. - No!
Oh. - Where do you think people are gonna go to the bathroom?
I never thought of that.
And you are now in charge of that, and if you dig a hole in a- in, in a dirt field, I'm gonna k*ll you.
I don't want the responsibility.
You can do this, man.
What, what are your chores?
Well, Porta Potties.
Porta Potties.
What's ... now, what is the first chore that I gave you?
I have absolutely no memory.
Balloons!
I'm having an anxiety att*ck.
Yes, Ma, yes, now, look, I-have to go.
It's two men celebrating living together for ten years.
Uh, no, they're not.
No, I can tell you for a fact that they're not.
Okay, okay, I'm hanging up.
So, good news.
Um, my mom spoke to your mom last night, and they've given us their blessings.
So that means...
Well, now that the moms approve, when do you want to do this thing?
Is that a... that a proposal?
Oh, are, are you upset? I'm sorry, I...
It's just, with arranged marriage, there isn't a lot of romance.
No, no, no, I'm s ... I'm sorry, actually.
I think I'm just a little taken aback by how quick this all has been.
I barely know you, and...
I used to just think that if I was being proposed to, I would notice it was happening.
But we're doing this thing?
Maybe you could just stop saying "doing this thing."
Yup.
Really did it.
Beautiful job, thank you so much, what a...
This is amazing ... everything's tin, you guys, everything.
Hey, man.
Rented out the whole park, so take your soccer someplace else.
Give us our ball back, you douche.
Hey, yeah, sure, no, I'll give you your ball back. Great.
Pure tin, pure tin.
Take your football back to Europe.
Really? - Who's the douche now, you douche "B"?
I couldn't stop you from inviting Jax to the party, but I can stop it from going any further.
I will not lose Jax as a friend, okay?
I might not have any game, but, oh, my goodness, can I take game away.
I'm getting that mouth on my mouth, and don't you try to stop me, you...
Look, clearly I have the upper hand when it comes to Jax.
Do you? - Oh, I do, because I know all about sports.
Jess, you know nothing about sports.
Oh, what am I going to do? I guess I'll just have to use my eyes, hair, boobs, legs, and adorable personality.
Fool.
I got, like, three of those things.
These are amazing.
You also got tablecloths?
I feel so fancy.
How much did you spend on this, Schmidt?
Ah, Nicholas, I have what's called an income, you know.
Well, you're not the only one who spent a little bit of money on this.
Okay. - Check this out, Schmidt, you're gonna freak out.
Hey, I'm presenting, I'm presenting it.
And that ain't no rental.
Get up here.
This is owned and operated by Mr. Nick Miller.
Little help from Sid.
You bought a Porta Potti?
This one has warm and cold water, real soap dispensers, a fan.
Too much.
What's that? That's garbage.
Garbage ... that's what the nursing home said about my mattress. I'll take it.
For 60 bucks, and they threw in something called
"septic enzymes," which I don't know what that is, but you're not supposed to get it in your eyes, for sure.
I'm a small business owner.
Why on earth would you buy a...?
You know what? Forget about it, I'm proud of you.
Thank you, man. - I gave you a chore and you came through.
Yeah, now, look, now we have two.
What do you mean we have two ... two of what?
Two bathrooms.
Yours and El Baño Presidente.
That's a Porta Potti?
Yeah, luxury toilet.
I thought that was the visitor's center.
Well...
That's enormous.
Why did you get that, Schmidt?
What, did you think I was gonna screw up?
No, come on, man, no.
You know how our relationship works.
I'm over-responsible, you're under-responsible.
Here's the good news ... now people have a backup to use...
No, I want everyone to use this, I want it to be the main potty.
Oh, n-no, I don't think that should be the main anything.
I think people would be better off if they just made a caca in their hand.
I don't think so;
Mine's better than that.
I'm sure you k*lled it on balloons.
Well... if you let me explain what happened with the balloons...
Who needs balloons?
I didn't want balloons anyway.
This isn't a little girl's birthday party.
This is a celebration of friendship.
Then, as a friend...
Yeah.
I want you to get rid of that.
I want everybody using mine.
You spit on the...
You brought a dirt dungeon to our TinFinity.
All right, well, we'll see.
I'm proud of you;
You did good.
I'm proud of you. You bought a spaceship.
Hey, man, you watch Homeland?
No? I'm in the first season, second episode.
Don't spoil anything.
Hey, flag on the play.
Too many men on the field.
Winston, get out.
Jax, over here on the bench with me.
Come on, let me show you some stuff.
Okay.
Go, go, Jess, go.
Oh, boy.
You want me? Come and get me.
I'm gonna get you... you can't get by me.
You're down.
Why would you do that?
Winston, we're on the same team.
What are you doing?
You did it!
Touchdown!
Man.
N-N-No!
Why?
What's going on, Sid?
Did you tell 'em that ours works?
Hey, guys, this is available, no line.
That Porta Potti looks weird, Nick.
What?
It looks a little, looks a little weird.
You look a little weird, Sanders.
Why don't you wipe your butt with a little strawberry crepe, you little whiner?
I don't really do well with bathroom pressure.
Robby, don't dog me like this.
I'm gonna give you your space.
No, 'cause they're all following you, Robby, they're all...
Get in there.
I don't have to go anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
So that's not full of pee?
No.
I saw you drinking those sodas.
No, no, no, it's good.
How about now?
Stop, stop, you're gonna make me...
I don't have to go, I don't have to go.
Get in there, dude, or get out of this party.
Wrong choice.
Nick, what are you doing?
I bought a Porta Potti, Jess.
What, why?
Yeah.
I'm a small business owner...
You own a Porta Potti?
Yeah, but nobody's using it.
This is not about a Porta Potti.
It is about a Porta Potti.
I don't want to talk about this.
You know, it's been really nice hanging out with Jax because he likes to talk about his feelings.
Give me a break, Jess. Is that really what you want ...
a man who talks about his feelings all the time?
No, right?
Do you want me to use your Porta Potti?
Yeah, but don't just do it for me; Do it 'cause you want to.
Mm, I'm definitely doing it for you.
And just a tip...
Yeah?
If you want people to use your toilet, don't camp out in front of it.
Do me a favor, if you're going to go in.
Mm-hmm. - Really sell it, 'cause I want girls to see it.
Okay. - You know what I mean? Just, like, make a show of it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye, Jess, thank you Ooh, just my style!
Nicely vintage.
Can't wait to get inside!
Sure wish I had a good book.
Can't wait.
Oh, this is horrible!
I got it; You told me like, ten times.
Okay, but I'm just saying, I don't know what that one does.
Look, the instant the big speech begins, you initiate toast sequence.
You got that, Red?
Look, don't-don't mess this up.
Tippy go bye-bye, you mess this up.
Tippy go bye-bye.
Okay.
Okay, great.
Bite me, you wang.
What did you say, man?
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey.
You remember Shivrang?
Shivrang, what is up, my man?
Welcome to America.
Listen, just a little heads up, we're serving cow-meat tacos tonight, so...
You mean beef.
Cow meat, Shivrang.
I'm not crazy.
It is beef, right?
Hey, can I just say I like you a lot?
I like you, too.
A lot?
'Cause I said "A lot."
I-I knew I felt this way, the moment I met you.
Yes, a guy who can tell me exactly how he feels.
That's what I want.
That is what I want.
It's just...
You, uh...
You make me...
Are you okay?
I-I like you a lot.
Yeah, I-I...
Yeah...
I'm fine, I mean...
You know what else I like?
I like beer.
I drink beer.
'Cause I'm a man, and I play football.
You want some beer? I'm gonna get a beer.
Hey, there you are.
Hey, Schmidty.
. It's almost toast time, and I made... - Okay.
...made up a few cards. You know, just jotted down a few notes and b*llet points for you.
I was gonna do my own toast.
I know what I want to say about you.
At least take a look at them.
I worked really hard on these.
"I'm nothing without you."
"Thank you for supporting me
"during that thing, financially and..."
This is a full speech.
Feel free to make it your own.
Why is it that you think you're better than me, Schmidt?
What? What are you talking about?
Why do you think you're better than me?
Our friendship didn't used to be this way.
You know, back in college, we were equals.
You get any last night?
No. You?
Hell, yeah.
Really?
No.
We're equals.
Equals.
And then you got that juicer, which I was excited about.
You were at a dangerous fat level, but somehow you got skinny, and I became this idiot that you need to take care of.
Don't resent me for getting my life together.
Oh, your life's together?
Yeah.
You're throwing a party to celebrate living with your college roommate for ten years.
Yeah.
What are we doing here?
What are we celebrating?
What do you mean,
"what are we celebrating?"
We're celebrating TinFinity!
Ten years, two hearts, one home!
Loyalty and great conversation.
It's right here on the cards!
Okay, that ain't right.
Hey, Winston.
Aha.
I see you've come to gloat.
Is Jax known for being intense?
Yeah, Jess, he's supposed to be intense.
He's a professional athlete.
You know, he doesn't run.
He sprints.
He doesn't jump. He leaps.
And he doesn't like, Jess. He loves.
Hmm.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, look, I'm sorry about...
No, no, no, no, don't be... don't be sorry. It's...
The truth is...
I just got out of a relationship that sort of crushed me.
And everybody thinks that pro football players are big and strong, and I am.
It's true. Look.
Whoa!
This is nothing for me.
I can have 20 of you.
Never put me down.
But that means...
when I fall, I fall hard.
And yes, sometimes I cry.
I cry, too. I cry all the time.
I cry in my bedroom, in the bathroom, in the hallway, in the elevator.
This morning... I woke up crying.
I have this feeling...
it's like I've known you forever.
I have this feeling, too.
Like, I want to French you.
I really want to French you.
Ex-Excuse me. Can I... Can I have your attention, please?
Uh, excuse me. Could I please have your attention?
Um... Oh. Whoa.
Hello. I don't know, um, any of you, but I'm Shivrang. Hello.

Hi. Uh, I'd like to say something, too.
That's Jax McTavish.
I know.
Um, I'd like to report a missing item.
My heart.
It was stolen by that little heart thief right there.
I'm... I'm innocent. I didn't... I was framed.
I just want to say in front of God and all these people at this gorgeous party that I'm in love with you.
Mm... no. No.
And I know it's early...
Nah.
...but I think I met the girl that... I'm gonna marry.
Who...? Who?
I'm gonna marry you!
We are not on the same page.
I'm gonna marry you.
I'm gonna put a baby in you.
We're gonna have dogs and cats.
I met my third wife!
Schmidty? Schmidty?
Schmidty? Hey.
Schmidt...
Stop it!
You okay, buddy?
Yeah. No, I'm-I'm fine.
It's just, I'm really annoyed about the lighting cues.
Also, our girl-to-guy ratio is taking a real nosedive.
I mean, we're, like, two bro groups away from being a total wiener fest.
It's just really disappointing when things don't work out the way you thought they would, you know?
I do.
Hey, why don't we get out of here for a bit?
Get away from this party stress.
You mean, like, take a trip together.
No, just, like, walk 40 yards away.
Don't think we need a trip or anything like that, pal.
Jess?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, my God!
So excited for you. Let me see it.
Yeah.
Oh. So beautiful.
Mm-hmm.
Is this good? This is good, right?
It's good.
I mean, it's-it's what I wanted.
Yes! Yay!
I'm getting married!
So, what are you... what are you doing in here?
I'm hiding.
Oh, yeah, that guy.
He seemed to, uh, really like you when he gave that speech. - Yeah.
He might not be the one.
So you still thinking about Nick?
No. Shut up. No.
All right.
Look at that, man. You did get a balloon.
Yeah, I got a kick-ass hot air balloon.
But it turns out, you need propane to get it up in the air.
You didn't know that?
How would I know?
You didn't want to do any research?
How could I do any research? I was dealing with the Porta Potti.
It's actually kind of nice.
It's peaceful.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry about Cece, man.
I know it sounds kind of cheesy, but I always thought that I was gonna be the man to bone Cece for the rest of her life.
I think we all did, buddy.
To answer your question from before, this is what we were celebrating.
Yeah, that's right.
This is what we're celebrating.
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.
Right? You're my best friend, man.
Please.
Ten years of living together Upsetting, but kind of great, man.
Here's to it.
Yes.
Not having roommates is for real losers, you know that?
Mm-hmm.
Equals.
You said it, man.
Oh, you are such a Nancy boy.
What is in that, man?
Liquor!
♪ If not for you... ♪
♪ Babe, I couldn't find the door... ♪
Mm. You pick out a song for our first dance?
Yes, I did.
I didn't expect you to dance to it, but you know, I was going to dance for you.
Yeah. Come on, it's too close quarters for that, Schmidt.
That is beautiful. Pass the hooch.
Nick's been hogging it all.
Mmm. Here, have a sip.
My mouth's been on it. It's not a big deal.
It's just my mouth!
I... I... It's okay. I'm all right.
Come on, have a sip!
You put your mouth all over it!
You just said that. You put your mouth all over it, and I don't want to think about your mouth!
You okay? I just...
Yup, I'm fine.
What are you doing? What are you doing, Jess?
I just don't understand why we only have...
I mean, I feel like I should have my own bottle.
Because we were all gonna share...
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going!
Where are you going?!
We're pretty awesome wingmen for each other.
Right.
Because we're both the guy the girls want to sleep with, and we're both the other guy, too.
Neither one of us are Tom Cruise or the other one.
We're both Iceman.
Yeah. Equals!
Equals!
You get a lot of girls?
Um, I don't know. Yeah...
Yeah. Me, too.
I feel like you probably have a lot of game with the ladies. - I know what they want sexually, and I'm not afraid to give it to them.
I get that from you. I get that vibe, man.
What about you?
I feel like I put off a similar vibe, but kind of more on the down-low, you know what I mean?
Yeah!
Equals!
Equals!
I like how things aren't weird between us.
Right? 'Cause if somebody walked in here and saw us, they'd be, like, "Look at those two totally normal roommates.
I bet they never sucked face."
But we did. You sucked my face.
I sucked your face.
You did.
Who cares?
You totally sucked my face.
Sorry that I touched your hand there.
It was accidental. Like, who acc...?
Yeah. I mean, which is cool,
'cause that's the thing. It's, like, we're just roommates.
Who cares? We're just cool.
I totally agree. Yes.
You know what I mean?
Let's reward ourselves,
'cause we're doing so well.
Table for two, fanciest restaurant in town.
Yeah, and then we could have sex.
Just joking, I was just jok ... I was just joking.
Yeah, no, I know it was a joke.
Spot. There's-There's a parking spot.
I just finished rinsing out the Dumpster, and while I was buffing the backside, I found this ...
4D.
So, who gets the spot?
Me.
You know what? I never get anything.
I would like it.
I need a win.
Give me the spot, or I'll k*ll you all!
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
I park under an overpass.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
We all have crappy parking.
Guys, why don't we just all share the spot?
We'll each get it for a day and a half every week, and then we split Sunday into six-hour shifts.
Does it say "Share stuff"
in the Constitution of America?
No, it does not. Nicholas, what does it say?
Don't share stuff.
No one deserves that spot more than I do.
You know? 'Cause Lord knows, I've done my fair... share of...
spotworthy things.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. Daisy travels so much, and I work at night, so, you know, our sex window is... like...
I've lived in this loft as long, if not longer, than anyone.
I have the crummiest room, I'm on 24-hour grout watch.
I pay the lion's share of the utilities, do I not?
I refuse to pay for the wiffi.
It's WiFi.
I didn't even have to tell you guys about the spot.
Why did I tell you guys about the spot? Oh, damn it!
I'm the dumbest boy in school!
As the only woman in the loft...
Don't play the lady card.
I will play the lady card.
Race card.
Lazy drunk card.
Deserves-the-spot card.
Do I not, every day, have to deal with Outside Dave?
Dave? I have to use my car now, Dave.
I work so hard, I just want some sleep!
Dave, I'm gonna go get some coffee.
Um, can I get you anything?
2% latte.
He throws dentures at me, he doesn't like cookies.
Because I believe so strongly in women's equality, I refuse to give you preferential treatment.
Well, that's really cool, Schmidt. I really...
Wait a minute.
Oh.
Sex window.
Now, if you all will excuse me, I am about to go and park my car on her parking spot.
Ew. Ew!
As if there was anything more important than this.
Get out.
I still want the spot, though. Obviously not getting the spot.
And then there were three.
That's right. Just the way I want it.
Come on! It's a good job, guys.
Yes! How do you two care about stuff so much?
Well, you know what this means, Jessica, don't you?
Nicholas Miller is now a swing vote.
What? No!
He's right, 'cause we're both voting for ourselves, so that makes you the decider.
You two are on your own. I'm out.
You can't escape destiny.
She comes for us all, that relentless bitch.
That's right. Destiny's a lady.
Destiny might be a lady, but victory has a penis.
Direct quote ... Scott Caan.
Yup.
Hey.
I found one of your hoodies, and I borrowed it.
You want to know what I'm wearing underneath this shirt?
Yeah, sure.
An invisible shirt.
I'm confused, Jess.
These are so long. Oh.
I wouldn't put that in your mouth.
Do you chew on this?
I do.
Mmm. You do, huh?
It's crunchy.
Oh.
You get h*t in the head or something?
Hmm?
Are you flirting with me to get the spot?
How dare you accuse me of that.
The parking spot is yours.
Really?
Yeah.
Thanks, Nick. That's so cool of you.
Sometimes I can be a gentleman, believe it or not.
Cool.
Cool. All right.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get in here. Yeah, we can...
Let's hug this out.
Purple nurple!
Thank you.
I don't know why I did that. I'll get ice.
Why did you do that?
Oh, finally. What took you so long?
I said 2:45, not 3:08.
I couldn't follow your directions.
I'm telling you, girl, this complex is like a maze.
Every building in this place looks exactly the same.
And for future reference, I'm more of a left-right kind of guy, not so much a north-south kind of guy.
Put on a condom.
Hmm... I don't, uh...
You forgot a condom?
You got a grocery bag?
No.
Tin foil?
No.
Hand sanitizer?
No.
You got a shower cap and a twist tie?
You didn't bring the one thing we need to have sex?
What about a baseball cap that's really small?
Are you serious?
Um, I got quick reflexes.
Mm, I'm gonna take care of this, okay?
Okay, well, look, do not waste my time.
I will be back faster than you can say,
"Damn, Winston, I took care of myself already."
Don't-don't say that, though.
Do not... Wait for me. Wait...
Who wants an ice-cold Heisler, all dressed up in a frosty mug?
Sure. I like beer.
I know you haven't officially decided on the spot yet, but I just wanted to say, thanks, man.
What for, Schmidt?
We both know that you're gonna give the spot to me, but I love that you're keeping up the charade.
Spot's going to Jess.
Jess?
Jess.
Give me the beer back.
I'm trying to be a gentleman.
Hey, Schmidt. Hey, Nick.
Oh.
How you doing?
Good. How are you?
Good.
What the hell?
Hmm?
What... the hell?
I'm checking my e-mails.
Oh. Okay.
Think that I'm blind? Think I can't smell it?
You think I can't hear it?
The stench of filth and lust is all over this room.
Smells like freaking Tijuana.
What... happened here?
Nothing.
Hardly anything.
Hardly anything?!
You know I'm not good at this, Jess.
Shut up. Okay, fine.
We kissed. Eh.
It was nothing. So? Uh, moving on.
Don't be weird about this, Schmidt.
Remember... I mean, it was like a dare, basically.
Yeah.
Mazel... tov to the both of you.
Well, I don't know what "Mazel tov" means, but it doesn't sound good.
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry about that.
Emergency. Emergency. Sorry about that.
I need a condom.
That'll be $8.75.
All right.
What the hell? What the...?
Damn it, took Daisy's pants.
Look, I don't have any money right now, but, you know, I have somebody waiting for me, so if you could just, you know?
Next.
Wait. No. No, no, no, no.
Uh, look, what about that box of condoms right there, man?
They're practically open, right?
How about you just slide one out and throw a brother a loosie?
Next.
Come on.
Hey, everybody.
What's up?
My name is Winston Bishop, and I am in desperate need... of a condom.
Okay, that's it.
Now hear me out.
Okay? Okay.
Come on. Sorry, folks.
Hey, Schmidt?
Hello, Schmidt? You okay?
Who? Me?
Yeah.
Yeah, look, guys, I'm fine.
Look, I admit, at first I was thrown, but I'm fine.
Are you seriously doing this?!
I can't believe this! This is so dumb!
I'm sorry.
I'm just... I'm trying to process this whole thing.
Nick, you're my best friend, and you should have told me.
And Jess, what do you think? Mono is just some sort of joke?
Nothing has changed.
Like same old, same old.
Except for the fact that, uh, pre-kiss Jess didn't have a parking spot.
Post-kiss Jess does.
Sounds... like... change.
I won the spot fair and square, Schmidt.
Did you, though?
I wouldn't say fair and square.
All right. Fine.
I used my body. Is that what you want to hear?
I shook what the good people of Oregon gave me, and I got a parking space.
Let me tell you something, Nicholas Miller.
You know, had Winston kissed me, you're the first person I would have told!
I know you would have told me if Winston kissed you.
But I guess your loyalty lies elsewhere.
I can't handle this!
Fine. Schmidt, congratulations.
The spot is yours.
Okay. Really.
It's him.
What?! Nick Miller, you weakling.
I can't have people thinking my decision wasn't above board.
This city can't have another scandal!
Wise choice.
Thanks.
He's been manipulating you the whole time.
Look at him.
I don't think...
Look at his smi ... he's smiling evilly.
You know what, Jess? Stop.
You're manipulating me, he's manipulating me, and I'm getting confused.
I am the decider of us three!
I decide!
Let the decider decide!
I am not the suggester!
I'm not having a good time with this game.
Give my regards to Outside Dave.
Stay away from my space...
or you'll have this to deal with.
S...
Where are your nipples, man?
I'll never tell.
You're either gonna break your finger, or you're gonna break that button.
I'm not going back in there. It's too weird.
You're the one making it weird, Nick.
You want weird? I'll give you weird.
Weird, weird, weird.
Fine. Weirder, weirder, weirder.
Weird, weird, weird.
Uh, weird, right, ugh.
Weird.
Weird. Weird.
Weird, weirder, weird.
Weird, weird.
Weird, weird.
Weird.
Weird! Weird. Weird!
What are we doing?!
I don't know! You started it!
Is this how it's gonna be? Is it?
What are we talking about, Jess?
You think things like this aren't gonna come up all the time?
We need a long-term solution.
I'll give you a long-term solution.
I'm taking the spot!
Oh, my God.
What is all the commotion?
He's taking the spot!
He can't do that!
k*ll him, k*ll him ... you said you'd k*ll him!
Now k*ll him! Now's your chance!
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
First car in the spot gets it.
Aah!
Aw, damn it!
You middled me again?!
I'm not to be middled; It's in my contract.
sh**t!
Excuse me.
Aah!
Hey, five bucks if you help me fold this nicely.
I'm not going above six, so don't negotiate with me.
Aah!
Go, go, sorry, go.
Oh, I'm sorry, I ... okay, sorry, go.
Move it, you wacky bitch!
It won't start.
Help me push it!
Get behind it.
Back in the box!
Aw, cats.
Hey, hey, buddy.
What?
Mine.
The laws of parking require a vehicle.
This is my vehicle.
This is my vehicle.
Don't.
Don't you do it, Schmidt.
I'm not afraid.
Schmidt, no.
You just h*t me.
Damn right I did.
You're sitting right in the middle of the spot.
You h*t me with your car over a parking spot, Schmidt.
Get out of the spot!
Jess.
Move or I will h*t you. I want that spot.
No.
Have you lost your mind?
Not a joke, move, move.
No.
What are you doing, Jess?
Move, move.
Jess, stop it.
What are you doing? Stop the car, you lunatic. She's insane.
No ... oh!
O-h!
No, no!
What is she doing?
What is going on?
Can't believe I'm going down like this.
You're not in the space!
Okay, all right, mine, mine, I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving either.
I have a purse full of hard candy and an empty bladder.
I'm here all night, folks.
I'm here all night.
I'm here all night.
I'm here all night.
I ... that's what I said.
I'm really happy you gave me another sh*t.
Yeah, so am I.
You know, you, you can't judge someone based on their friends.
No, and I feel like, if you gave them another chance, you'd really like them.
They are down to earth and chill, no drama.
Yeah?
Hey, Cece, it's Winston!
You got a rubber?!
I need a rubber.
He said "rhubarb," that's how he pronounces "rhubarb"
It's so weird.
Nah, nah, I-I need a condom for my penis!
What are you doing?
Okay, we're not close enough for this.
Alright, we have spent very little time together.
You are the only person that I know in this neighborhood.
Don't you dare come in my house.
Hey, man, hey.
Hey.
I'm Winston, good to see you again.
Shivrang, Hi.
You got a condom on you?
Oh, no, no, look that's not, We're, um...
Her mother and my mother...
I'm a chemical engineer.
Winston, Look, Shivrang, man to man, I know you have a condom in your wallet, but my question to you is: Do you actually think you' gonna get lucky with a a sexy lady like that?
You know, I feel like I'm getting lucky by just being here.
Be honest with me.
Ok, fine, I've got a condom.
Aha!
Winston.
Is he going to need that condom tonight?
Oh, God.
I'm gonna punch you in the face.
Shall I give you a minute to think about it?
'Cause I can wait.
I'm gonna wring your damn neck.
This is awful, like, really...
Okay, okay. Get out.
This is worse than last time.
Honestly, physically removing you now.
I'm going.
Out of my house.
It's a sour ball, not a bank safe.
Just open the candy.
Are you hungry?
Yes, I'm starving.
Why don't you go upstairs to the kitchen?
It's full of food.
Just give me the damn candy.
Go get it.
Wait, no, no, no.
Aah.
Okay, I have, like, a s*ab pain, it's ...
and it's, and it's like right here.
It's my pishy.
I, I have to pish.
I think we should take a break.
Leave and you're out.
Drown in your own urine.
I got to find a condom.
I need a condom!
But I still want the spot.
Come on, come on, come on, Nick, come on.
Okay.
Condom, condom, condom.
Damn it.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Here we go... here we go.
I mean, she's either having crazy amounts of sex or she does not know how to use these things.
Oh, just focus, man, bring it in.
Absorb it.
Yeah.
Did you just pee inside your body?
Yes.
This is your fault, Nick.
You compromised the whole loft.
We had an agreement.
When Jessica Day signed that lease, you, me, and Coach all took a no-nail oath.
No-nail oath?
I didn't break the no-nail oath.
Your mouth nailed her mouth.
For the record, no one nailed my mouth.
That's important to me.
Also, we didn't do anything wrong.
Do you know nothing about men?
Yeah, I know nothing about men.
That's why I'm wearing a short skirt and wool tights.
A woman cannot be in close quarters with three men and kiss one of them.
What fuels men?
Competition and sex.
That's why the United Nations was formed, that's why girls aren't allowed on pirate ships, and that is why there is a no-nail oath in apartment 4D, and deep down inside, Nick knows that I'm right.
Mm-hmm, back me up here, Nick.
I just want a piece of candy.
Are you serious? You didn't give me the spot and now you won't back me up?
You coward.
Why should he?
Because he ... because...
Because, what, you kissed, and now he owes you some sort of emotional support and loyalty?
Reason number two for the no-nail oath ...
bitches be crazy.
Isn't that right, Nick?
I found garbage that has chocolate on it.
Daisy, I'm back.
Daisy.
Hey, Daisy, I'm here! Where you at?!
I don't have my phone, and all these buildings look alike, and I...
Hey, Daisy!
You know Daisy?
Shut up.
No? All right, okay, cool.
Now, I walked around with "yum"
on my butt all day.
I deserve sex ... protected sex.
Daisy...!
Schmidt's right.
I thought we could go back to the way things were, but we can't.
You nailed my mouth...
and you nailed it good and hard and strong.
Now things have changed.
Okay, but they don't have to have changed.
It's just different, Nick, it is.
That kiss was the dumbest mistake I have ever made ...
dumber than Caroline, dumber than law school, dumber than when I thought it was pronounced
"Brock Omabrama."
What?
I thought his name was pronounced
"Brock Oma..."
It's not...
If I could go back in time and take back the kiss, I would.
I would take it back, I regret it.
Congratulations, you're the proud owner of a new parking spot.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Jess, wait.
You realize, every second that you don't run after her, you become more and more of a buttwad, don't you?
Did you pee yourself?
That I did, that I did.
Jess.
Hi.
Hey, look...
Why you holding a box of fish sticks?
Because I'm going to go scare the feral cats away that live in my current parking spot, Nick.
I'm going to throw fish sticks at them while singing "Memory," and don't you dare criticize me.
I don't regret kissing you.
I regret what it did, I regret that it made things weird.
We are roommates, you know, we got to figure this out, Jess.
A no-nail oath?
You thought I was going to sleep with one of you, like I just couldn't help it?
It was me, Jess, I couldn't help it.
You dropped your fish sticks.
Shut up, Nick.
Ay, ay, ay.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
We're having a conversation.
Will you please get out of here?
Yeah, well, that's the problem, isn't it?
Because I live here, too, and I'm gonna be here when all of this goes to crap.
Next time you guys have your dirty little thoughts about each other, you better be thinking about me, too, because I ain't going nowhere.
You are literally sitting in a puddle of your own pee.
The apartment 4D no-nail oath right here:
"We, the undersigned,
"Agree never to nail our roommate Jessica Day
"unless the sex can be parlayed into a business that provides for all parties involved."
What?
I didn't read the fine print.
"If one of the undersigned nails said female, well, then all must nail her."
What?!
I didn't know there was fine print.
What, what?!
I didn't know there was fine...
Let me be very clear here ... I am a strong, self-sufficient woman, and I will not be nailing you, Schmidt, or Nick or Schmidt.
Notice I said that twice because I don't feel it's sinking in.
There will be no nails or screws or hammers in this building area generally, the whole thing.
What, do you think that I want to do this?
Believe me, pass.
I just don't want my home turning into a den of sexual tension and lies.
Now, do you want things to go back to normal or not?
Yes.
Yes, I do, but I...
Then, I just have to kiss you.
This is just one of those things ... let's just do it...
No, I-I...get past it, we move on.
I think that's a bad idea.
Nick, you're into this, right?
I don't know, might help.
Are you serious?
I don't know.
Okay, fine, just get over here and do it and do it fast.
I'll be a hero.
Bring it on.
Mmm...
Aah.
Ooh.
No.
No.
Mistake.
It was really a mistake.
A big mi ... I made it weirder.
Is everyone in the world having sex but me?!
Old people, foreigners, nerds.
Everyone's banging.
Schmidt and Jess?!
Everyone is out there getting and giving except for old Winnie.
Look at me ...
a man who has absolutely nothing.
I left my phone, my wallet, and my dignity at Daisy's house.
I even left my pants there ... look at this.
Yum.
Yum.
I need a win, damn it, I need a win.
You need a win, pal.
Yeah.
It's a little tight in here.
Are you sure this isn't too tight?
Okay, um...
Uh-uh, this ain't gonna work.
This ain't gonna work for me.
Uh, I'm stuck.
Guys, hey, guys.
Hey, where y'all...?
Guys... guys...
Guys!
Hello?
(Whispers):
Oh, my God!
(Sighs)
(Snoring)
Oh, you kissed her! You idiot!
You...
(Groans)
(High-pitched gasp)
No, no, no.
(Muffled shrieking)
I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't. No, no, no.
I wasn't doing anything,
I wasn't doing anything, I...
(Whispering):
Do not walk away from me.
Do not. You are not.
You're doing it. Nick?
- Shamone.
- He did.
(Sighs)
(Yawning)
(Both yawning loudly)
Oh.
Ugh, my God.
Oh, I just woke up.
I've been sleeping
for hours and hours.
Nice. Me, too.
Let's see here.
Oh, sweet. Ten e-mails.
Hey, Sam, um...
I have to tell
you something.
How do you always look
so beautiful in the morning?
Sometimes I can't
even look at you.
I can't even--
I got to look away.
I can't even look
at you right now.
Wait, but I got to.
Now I got to look away.
I just can't resist.
Oh, geez.
(Laughs)
What were you gonna say?
Nothing.
It was nothing.
Jess?
Nick kissed me.
Wha...?!
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
(Whistles)
(Groans):
Oh, man. Okay.
I had the best sex of
my life last night.
Winston, I'm glad you're here.
We need to talk.
Yeah. Daisy said I was
pretty good.
You hear that?
Pretty good!
This is important.
And I ain't even use my hands.
You didn't use your hands?
Well, just I did a lot
of side stuff.
Okay, Winston,
you're k*lling me.
I really need to talk to you,
and now after hearing that,
I can barely look at you.
Well, I got
my mojo back, baby!
I'm the Mojo Man!
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, we're not gonna be
getting to my thing, are we?
(Whispers):
Mo-Mo-Mojo Man.
I got to tell Sam.
I can't tell Sam!
I didn't even do anything wrong!
Nick kissed me!
I didn't even kiss him back!
Okay, fine!
I kissed him back!
Is that what
you want me to say?
I literally
haven't said a word
for, like, over an hour.
(Groans)
And now he won't
even talk to me,
'cause I saw him this morning
and he just panic
moonwalked away from me.
- He what?
- He does that sometimes.
Man. Terrorism.
And then... ha!
Nick just... He just...
Kisses you.
Stupid Nick Miller. (Grunts)
How was it? Was it...?
I was like Scarlett O'Hara
in my freaking curtain dress...
How did he do it?
- He just, like, grabbed me.
- Uh-huh.
- And he just took me.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, he was a man
and I was a woman.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It was firm, but tender.
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah, I mean,
I saw thorough space and time
for a minute,
but that's not the point.
Oh, man!
Are you okay?
I miss sex!
I've been on dates set up by
my mother for the past month.
- Mm.
- I mean, what are you gonna do?
(Groans)
I mean, do you...
like Nick?
Ah! Bah!
Mm-hmm.
(Laughs)
Nah! Neh?
(Giggles):
Nick?
(Laughs)
No.
(Chuckles)
I don't like Nick.
- Mm-hmm.
- I like Sam, 'cause
Sam's the kind of guy
who fixes things
that you didn't even know
were broken.
And Nick is the
type of guy
who breaks things... that are...
He breaks things!
Look at that.
It's for my grandma.
Wow, that's... oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you-- Nick!
- No, let me just...
- Nick, Nick, what are you...?
- Okay, here, it's fine.
- No!
Nick, what are you...?
I think those
belong back on it.
He is not getting in the way
of me and Sam.
He is not ruining this.
- Mm.
- So mad at him.
I can't even be around him.
Can I just spend
the day with you?
Oh.
Well, um...
Okay, I didn't tell you this
before, actually, but, uh...
SCHMIDT:
Cece is going to
an Indian marriage
convention today
to find herself
a brown husband.
Now, little
does she know
that I have signed up
for the same convention.
Gentlemen, there is
nothing that says
white men need not apply.
You look like
the fortune teller in Big.
Wait a second,
is it in the loft?
Yes, Nick.
The West Coast's premiere
Indian singles event,
where     eligible
Rajput Indians get together
to see if they should get
arranged-married to each other,
is in our loft.
So if it's not,
then I'm coming with.
I'm in, Schmidty.
You finally got company.
- I'm coming. Let's do it.
- The Mojo Man is in, too.
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
Okay, neither of you are coming.
I've been studying up
for a full week.
I can actually speak
conversational Hindi.
If that conversation is:
"Hello." "Hello."
"Samosa?"
"Yes, please, Samosa."
"More towels?"
"Do you know where
the white person's
toilet is?"
After that,
it gets very confusing.
Can you drive in that dress?
You're right, I can't.
- All right, you're driving. Let's go.
- Yeah!
Hi, I'm-I'm checking in.
My name's Cecilia Parikh.
This is my best friend.
She's just, she's just
here to watch.
All must participate.
We've had a lot of
trouble with watchers.
You participate
or you go home.
All right, you know what?
What the hell.
You're going to have to
fill out a questionnaire.
Information,
education, resume.
(Chuckles)
Done.
Thank you.
(Gasps)
What the hell are
you guys doing here?
You look like a character
from The Love Guru.
Aw, thank you.
Hello.
I'd like to check in
with my two friends here.
Look, we are not Indian,
but you cannot turn us away,
because I read the Website
vigorously, kumari.
- Oh, God.
- That means "miss."
My friend right there?
Yeah, he's a vakeel.
That means "lawyer."
I dropped out
of ka-heel school.
SCHMIDT:
It's vakeel, man.
What are you doing here?
Oh, no. I just-- uh, yeah...
Oh!
Nick, you're
embarrassing me.
WINSTON: Nick,
what are you doing?
WINSTON:
Nick, Nick.
N-N-N-Nick, what
are you doing?
Stop moonwalking, man.
(Groans)
Man, you have been
weird all morning.
Hey, look, I kissed Jess.
Say what you're gonna say.
(Groans):
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Whoo!
I thought that's
what you were gonna say.
I don't want a new roommate.
Look, don't...
She's not moving out.
I'm not talking about her.
Hell no, not her!
I'm talking about you.
When this thing bl*ws
up in your face--
and it will blow up
in your face, Nick--
you're the one moving out.
You think I like
living with you?
You have centipedes
living under your bed!
- Those weren't centipedes.
- You've named your testicles,
- and they're both named Sharon.
- Yeah, so what?
I can't believe you kissed Jess!
Man, what were you thinking?
Look, man, I wasn't
thinking anything.
Nick, just apologize and
make it right, all right?
All right.
That's what I'm gonna do.
(Groans)
Oh, Sharon!
- Get! Just...
- Get...?
Get over here now.
Wait. What?
You told me you had moved on.
Only people who haven't moved
on say things like that.
I'm a squirrel.
You're my nut.
Winter's coming. I'm gonna
store you in my cheek, girl.
Please leave.
You and I not being together
does not make sense to me.
I miss your body
and the things I
used to do to it.
- Schmidt.
- I'm talking about sex.
Today is about me finding
someone within my own culture
that I can build my life with.
It's about more than sex.
Our sex was about
more than sex.
It was about
history and memory
and thousands of years
of colonial suffering
all being released in one
moment of pure ecstasy.
Then why did the sex
always end with you yelling,
"Blammo, that happened"?
Blammo.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh, you can walk
normally now, I see.
I'm sorry I kissed you.
Well, oh, wow.
That was unexpected.
Thanks, Nick.
- You know what, it was a mistake.
- I feel better.
- 'Cause, yeah, I was feeling awkward.
- Yeah, good.
(Chuckles):
Right.
You were acting
a little bit weird,
but honestly, for me,
it was, like, a nothing kiss.
You know, it was like
kissing a cousin.
It was so nonsexual
and nothing.
Well... I think it
meant something.
You know, to you,
'cause you kissed me.
Mm-mm.
I think you can admit it
meant something to you, Nick.
Oh, no, I-I'm telling you,
it meant nothing to me.
- I think it did.
- No, no.
I do things
I don't mean all the time.
Like this. You see this?
Bottle of water.
Why did I do that?
I don't know.
It doesn't mean anything.
I think you can admit that
it meant something to you.
- Hey, Jessica, it didn't.
- Hmm.
It was a drinking game,
and I was finishing the game.
Yeah, but it happened
after the game
when it meant something.
- Oh, so it meant something to you?
- What?
- It meant something to you.
- No, don't...
If you think some
stupid, terrible kiss...
- You're thinking about
it right now!      - No!
- I'm calling Sam and...
- Oh, you're calling Sam right now?
He's gonna come here
and pick me up,
- and, uh, we're leaving.
- Oh, you are?
Why are you running away?
Because it meant something?
We're not going anywhere.
Meant nothing, Nick!
HOST (Over speaker): Please look
at the numbers on your name tags
and go to the table
with the corresponding numbers.
These are your groupings.
People with similar resumes
and education backgrounds
have been grouped together.
,   , thir...
Table   !
We're at the same table!
- So this is rock bottom.
- I mean, call me crazy,
but I think we're all
getting married tonight.
- Yeah, um...   - The money table
right here, Table   !
Hi, excuse me, I think
that there's been
just a little bit of a
mistake with the tables.
Over   , no advanced degrees,
part-time employment:
Table   .
No, see, actually, I'm-I'm
a professional model.
I'm not famous
or anything,
but I was in Lil
Wayne's last video.
I was the girl he was throwing
strawberries at in slow motion.
(Chuckles)
Definitely Table   .
(Sighs)
Excuse me?
Uh, I didn't get
assigned a table.
Now, I know exactly
what this is about...
But I did assign you a seat.
This one. Lap number one.
Okay, so this is not
a racial thing?
Not yet, it isn't.
Ah.
I see what's
happening here.
You're feeling my mojo.
You look like a jumpy cat,
and I like that.
Ooh, I like that.
(Gasps)
Like oversized
blueberries.
(Clicks tongue)
(Sighs)
Mojo off. Mojo off.
Schmidt, Table Seven,
Table Seven.
- What're you doing? You're at Table Seven, too?
- Hmm? I'm at Table Seven.
(Sighs)
What?
Well, you should feel complimented.
I feel slightly insulted.
- What?
- No offense.
A lot of offense taken.
Well, I'm just saying...
- A lot.
- Jess!
- Hi!
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Um, okay.
Yeah, I checked in.
Uh, they gave me my table.
- Okay.
- This is a weird date.
I always thought
we'd go bowling before we went
to an Indian marriage
convention.
- What table are you at?
- Uh, Table One, I think.
Table One?! It's almost like
you save lives or something.
Oh, wait, you do.
Let's start the icebreakers.
This exercise shows
how physically compatible
two people can be.
Ow! My hand!
What?
Stupid man.
Nice.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
Three, two, ow.
- Ow! No, no. Let's...
- Up?
- No, you go down.
- All right. I go down?
Kind of just got
to get in a little closer.
JESS:
Okay, I'm trying.
Seriously.
Hey, dummy.
Stop pointing your finger at me.
That's so annoying.
Why are you drinking my beer?
You point that finger at me
one more time, I'm...
Why don't you just admit that
that kiss meant something to you?
- No, no!   - I could tell it meant
something, so admit it
or I'll do this all day.
I'll do it all day.
HOST:
Next challenge: Make a table
out of nothing
but newspaper and tape.
Women look to your left,
men to the right.
These are your partners.
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.
First table that can hold
a phone book wins.
All right, so we have
to make a table.
Okay.
- Give me the tape.
- No.
I'll tell you what's not
made out of newspaper,
that tight little
ass of yours.
Jess, you liked kissing me!
It's fine to say that.
No, I didn't.
I'm not on my knee asking you
to marry me; It was a nice kiss.
You were like a dog and my mouth
was like a bowl full of
dog... milk!
It was like a damn fairy tale,
that kiss!
It was the best kiss
of your life.
- Are you serious, Nick?
- And you have to take
a little responsibility,
tarting around in that
- little soft pink robe, not expecting
to get kissed.   - Tarting around?
I'm a man, Jessica!
- What?
- Pink robes are my catnip.
And we have a winning couple!
BOTH:
We are not a couple!
- We're not a couple.
- And this is a very bad table.
- Terrible table.
- And stop clapping, everybody.
- This is awful.
- Look. It won't hold anything.
Be prepared to laugh!
No, I mean,
this is, like...
NICK:
I got it, I got it.
Here, put it down.
Just-- okay.
Very weak table.
Break!
It's a strong table.
Strong table, strong couple.
Come on. Jump up, yeah.
Jump up! Jump up! Jump up!
- Whoa! Come on.
- Wow.
- Wow, yeah. It's real, man.
- Come on.
That's an impressive table!
Congratulations on winning the
table-building competition, baby.
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything, so...
- I didn't think it meant anything.
- Yeah, no, just--
- Nick just drives me crazy.
- It's like-- you know?
- Yeah, I mean, I never...
- Well, yeah, that's just...
- That's what I was saying.
Is there something
I should know here?
No. 'Cause...
(Bell dings)
HOST:
Men, switch seats!
No. Sam, stop.
'Cause...
No, I want to talk to you.
- Sam, I...
- Do you like field hockey?
I... Yeah. Yeah.
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie. Pass.
So, when did you decide
to become a model?
Oh. Didn't really
think about it at all.
Someone just said they'd pay me
for being pretty, so...
- I like your hat.
- Shh.
- It's my favorite color.
- Shh...
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.
So how many children
do you want?
Well, I have to start soon, so
I guess I'll just jump right in.
So, do you think through
any of your decisions
or do you always just
do whatever you want?
Hey! M. Night Shyamalan.
I got a twist ending
for you: Shut up.
- What do you want, Table Seven?
- Schmidt, just talk to your girl.
- Hi!
- You better watch it, buddy.
'Cause I will, I will
Cal-cut-a-bitch up in here.
- I will Cal-cut-a-bitch.
- Schmidt!
Don't worry, Ben Affleck.
I'm not desperate.
I don't date below Table Six.
(Bell dings)
HOST:
Time's up. Switch places.
Sam...
That was not nice.
He crossed a line.
Schmidt, you said
you would leave me alone.
- You said you would leave...
- He crossed a line.
You said you would
leave me alone.
(Chuckles)
Funny seeing you here.
Hey.
You have to go.
Yeah, you have to go over there.
Okay. Bye-bye.
Go now. Hi.
Um, Sam, I do have
something to tell you.
You know why we're at Table   ?
'Cause we're both bad at life,
but we have model good looks.
It's 'cause we don't
think things through.
You didn't think it through
when you kissed Jess.
She told me. It's like we just
make these impulsive decisions,
and all we end up doing
is hurting other people.
I can't believe this.
No. No, Sam...
Sam? Wait.
Sam, wait.
I'm really sorry.
I said I wanted
to commit to this.
I thought you understood
what that meant.
JESS:
I do. I did.
Hey, hey.
Sam, listen.
JESS: What?
- Sam, hear me out.
I kissed her, okay?
She didn't kiss me.
It didn't mean anything to her.
Thank you.
(Grunts)
Oh, my God!
(Groans) I'm sorry, Nick.
It's the training.
He's in such terrible shape!
You could've k*lled him.
(High-pitched): I'm gonna
kick your ass, man.
SAM: Jess, it may
not have meant something
to you, but it meant
something to me.
Is there another doctor
in the house?!
With this crowd, I'm sure.
I'm done. So...
Good-bye, Jess.
No. Sam.
Ice it,    hours.
And keep it elevated.
- He even exits cool.
- Oh, God.
Anu? I got
something for you.
Now, this is Freddy.
As you can see,
he has the exact
same build as me,
all right?
And he is totally available.
Ain't that right, Freddy?
That is what I call
an arranged bang.
(Makes expl*si*n noise)
Freddy, are you scared of being
confined in small spaces?
Oh, you'll do just fine.
Now, just remember,
wherever you are,
the Mojo Man is there.
(Sighs)
Damn it, Schmidt.
I'm taking this.
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hold up!
You know, when I
came here today,
I thought India was
a pretty cool country.
You guys are obviously smart.
You l-looked at the roof
of a bus and you said,
"That's not just a roof,
that's more seating."
Kal Penn, he's a genius.
Thank you for him.
But what I didn't know
is that you're a country
full of blind idiots.
- Oh, God.
- Because in your midst
walks a brown angel.
That woman. Right there.
I may be an idiot,
but I'm smart enough
to know what I lost.
You people could've had it all.
And you shoved her over there
at a table with Nick.
Get your crap together, India.
Schmidt...
out!
(Crowd murmuring)
Hello. I didn't
see you over here.
I would love to...
(Men murmuring)
Sorry I didn't
see you earlier.
SCHMIDT: Okay.
They're all-- okay.
You don't all have
to run over there at once.
I mean, she... she's not
that great, you guys.
I mean, she's
kind of old.
You should see her areolas--
one's like a helicopter pad,
the other one's
like a, you know, like...
like a tick bite.
It's freaky. Very disorienting.
♪ It feels
like a perfect night ♪
NICK: Is this making
you feel better at all?
♪ At midnight, to fall
in love with strangers ♪
♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪
♪ Yeah, we're happy,
free, confused ♪
♪ And lonely at the same time ♪
I just wanted to listen
to Taylor Swift alone!
♪ Oh, yeah ♪
How's that?
You know when you get dumped and
you're, like, racking your brain
for what was it
that I did wrong?
Well, this is a really
unique situation
in that I don't have to do that.
Well, what happened?
(Music stops)
I'm sorry. I know what--
I know that it's my fault.
I didn't mean
it like...
(Sighs)
Jess, can I say something
- that'll potentially not
help this situation?  - No.
I've never been
a home-wrecker.
And I liked it.
I mean, Sam was
thr*at by me.
(Chuckles)
I mean, I see that as a victory.
But in-in more important...
uh, ways, a huge, huge,
devastating loss.
For you.
Should I call Cece?
This feels like Cece territory.
This isn't Nick territory.
This is, uh...
Look, Jess...
I'm sorry, okay,
that I kissed you.
But I shouldn't have done it,
because it was obviously
a mistake,
and now you're crying and...
I won't do it again.
Well...
(Sniffles)
maybe it was a little bit broken
to begin with.
- What happened?
- He just...
He always wanted
to fist bump in the morning.
- And you didn't like that?
- I hated it. What are... what...
- I feel like you're forgiving me.
- No.
- I felt like before I said that
you were though. - Nope. Nope.
Now you remembered you're
still mad at me. No? Okay.
- All right, good night, Nick. Night.
- Okay, good night, Jess.
Hey, Jess.
Too soon?
Yeah, too soon!
Well, hey, good night.
And I'm sorry about everything.
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
(Chuckles)
- That was...
- Yeah. That was...
- a little bit weird.
- So weird.
Let's not ever do that again.
- Yeah.
- Do it again. Okay.
- Good night. Night, Miller!
- Good night.
Good night, Sergeant.
I'm glad everything's
back to normal around here.
Thank you for
what you said up there.
- You know, I got a lot
of phone numbers. - Good.
I think I'm gonna go
on a lot of dates.
- I think that's a great thing.
Good.   - Yeah.
The plan hasn't changed;
I am still marrying an Indian guy.
- No, yeah, that's fine.
- Okay?
But you went home with a Jew in
a turban, so I'm just saying.
Just take this off.
Come on. Let's go.
(Sighs)
God, I have missed this.
(Moaning)
Turban on? Turban off?
I'm gonna hate myself
for saying this, but...
turban on.
- Turban on it is.
- Uh-uh
Taking that
magic carpet ride.
- Yeah? No?
- Shut up! Whoo!
Ah!
Look how handsome I look.
That is a woman's coat.
This coat has clean lines... and pockets that don't quit.
And it has room for your hips.
And when I wear it, I feel hot to trot.
You're wearing a dress.
Yeah, don't say "hot to trot."
My coat makes me say things like that.
First of all, Nick, it is not your coat.
True, it was delivered to the wrong address.
But then tell me, why does it fit like a damn glove?
What is happening to you, man?
I don't know if I can give up looking this damn good ...
It's someone else's woman's coat.
Nothing?
I mean, nothing? Damn it!
I've been trying to get something going with myself for a full hour.
It's like a taffy pull on a hot summer's day.
Eww! You have the door open, Schmidt.
I'm over myself ... I just don't do it for me anymore.
I even bought myself a sexy pair of underpants to spice things up ... didn't happen.
I just laid there.
You know what? That's it.
Tonight, I start having sex again.
Now, are you two gonna join me?
Not while I'm here, please.
Is that the way you wanted to say that?
I'm in, Schmidty! I am in!
I'm gonna have sex tonight.
Yeah!
Yeah!
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess.
I like this feeling, you guys. I'm liking the vibe that we got going here. There's definitely gonna be some sex-having tonight.
Oh, yeah...
Damn it, there needs to be.
You know I haven't had sex since Labor Day?
I know what the problem is ... I want it too bad.
So, what's your name?
Winst... W-W-W... yeah.
You just need a confidence boost.
Good news ... I'm lousy with the stuff I got your back tonight.
And you, London Fog, you're looking hot to trot, baby.
Any chance you're gonna take that coat off?
This jacket? No way.
I'm keeping the jacket on.
Take the jacket off.
No, I'm keeping the jacket on.
No, it's fine.
Band of brothers.
Band of brothers, yeah!
The club's up... Dance, dummy.
Hey, guys. Guess what?
Sam has the late shift and Cece's on a date with some Indian guy, so world's best wing-woman reporting for duty.
Jess, you can't come.
What?
Look, I actually want to get girls tonight.
You're my cooler.
What?
All I do is help you get laid, Nick.
Maureen, did you have one very special long-time love?
Yes.
You should be with him.
I'm not your cooler.
It's not you.
It's the way that you behave.
And the things that you say.
And the look on your face.
And...
It is you.
It's just you ... you're the cooler.
I'm sorry, but you can't come with us tonight.
I get it. Um...
I just... I have, um, a lot of things I have to do.
More important stuff to do here.
I have to clean out my closet and...
Oh, yeah. - I have an ice cream maker to try out.
That's better than going to a stupid club.
It's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be great. - Shut up.
Get out of here, girl, you're missing nothing.
It's gonna get so crazy.
Come on, buddy, get in there.
Get crunk with us, bro.
Yeah-ha-ha! Yeah!
I can't believe you got us kicked out of the discotheque, Nick.
I didn't even do anything.
Damn it, Nick, take the coat off, all right? It freaks girls out.
Well, maybe they're freaked out
'cause you're not wearing a trench coat.
Yeah? Have you ever thought of that?
Okay, guys, please ...
no more friendly f*re.
All right.
Okay.
Ooh, Schmidty type.
That's a Schmidty type right there.
That's me. Yeah, yeah. Schmidty time...
I feel good. Yeah. Schmidty time.
Schmidt! Hey, dude!
What?!
What about band of brothers?
Your friendship means nothing to me.
Every man for himself.
Hey, uh...
Hey.
I was, uh...
Most... M-M...
Okay... Yeah, can you...
In the beginning...
Tap out, man. Tap out.
What happened to building my confidence, Schmidty?
You went in too soon. Get out of here.
Go.
Go.
Hey.
What's happening?
Hi.
Wow, that was embarrassing.
Yeah...
Well..
You can relax.
I'm taken.
You were very beautiful from across the bar.
I'm sorry. I'm Schmidt.
I'm sorry... we were talking, Schmidt.
What a ten, what a beautiful woman.
He works here.
As a bartender.
Yeah, I do.
February clean-out.
What do you think, Nick?
I'm bored!
No bottoms, no bottoms.
Bottoms on top!
Robot can't find clothes to fit right.
Robot can't find clothes.
I do it for Kenya.
Silver?!
Damn you, Zimbabwe.
Hello?
Hello?
Nice coat you got there.
Well, I just actually wear it 'cause it gives me confidence.
That's kind of sad.
You know what's really sad is that he stole the jacket.
It's not technically stealing.
He's still reeling from being dumped.
Aw.
He's attached to it.
Like a little bitch "bwanky."
It's not like a blanky, dude.
It looks like a "bwanky."
It's not like my "bwanky."
The only reason I'm out tonight is to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
That's not true. I'm not gonna...
Shut up, Schmidt.
I mean, I could take care of you, if you wanted.
You can what?
I love sad guys and you seem sadder than most.
I think your plan sounds okay.
When you go home at night, do you look in the mirror and just think,
"I am the worst"?
Actually yes, I do.
Yeah?
Yeah, a lot of the times.
You hate yourself?
I definitely don't like myself.
It's right on the line of hate.
What the hell is this?
I don't know how to talk to women.
Reason being, I feel like you all think that I just want one thing from you.
Mm-hmm.
I want the one thing.
But a bunch of other th... can a man just want all the things?
I mean, damn.
I like a challenge.
And you are one big challenge.
I'm Daisy.
Winston.
Sam, it's Jess.
Please come get me.
I'm probably fine, but I also might be d*ad.
Good-bye.
It's Cece, leave a message.
Cece, it's Jess ... call me back, I'm alone in the loft.
I think there's something out...
There's something sexy about a man who just needs me to make him feel better.
I honestly need you to make me feel better.
Nicholas, your phone's ringing.
Not now, Schmidt!
Hey, Jess. It's Jess.
Schmidt, stop.
You should really talk to her.
Unbelievable. I am so sad.
Nicholas, you have a phone call.
Don't do this, Schmidt, please don't.
You are the dumbest...
Would you wait one second?
I'm just... I just have to do this.
I'll be sad in a second.
Yep.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sad.
Okay.
Uh, what is going on?
There's something at the door and you have to come home.
Cooler, Jess ... you are being a cooler right now.
Seriously, I think it might be g*ng related.
I've always been worried about my blue curtains...
Crips.
The Cri... Jess, I'm done!
Nick, I need you.
Yeah, so this is the place.
I'm really glad you're here.
The bedrooms are that way...
What are you doing, pal?
Never leave me alone again.
I'd like to introduce you to our roommate Jess.
Welcome to our home.
Jess, this loft has old pipes ...
I've told you that a million times, but you never listen during pipe talk.
Well, pipe talk's boring.
What is this?
What is what...?
You drew my face on a melon?
What else was I supposed to draw your face on?
Nothing. Don't draw my face.
Okay.
Jess, for some reason, that girl out there, she is sexually aroused by other people's misery.
Do you understand the position that puts me in?
It puts you in a really good position?
It really does. And then what happens?
Okay, I understand how, in this instance, I might have cooled things off for you.
Thank you for admitting that.
I am prepared to fix it.
'Cause, son, I'm gonna get you laid.
Okay, it's not how it is and never call me "son"
and don't talk like that.
The game is True American
Clinton rules.
Pick your interns.
I don't understand the game.
Uh, you're gonna be my intern.
It's okay, it's stripping.
It's not just stripping, it's sexy.
Okay, so what exactly are the rules?
The floor is lava, doves versus hawks.
The couch is the Mason-Dixon line.
We're not doing cabinets ... no cabinets.
No cabinet.
No cabinets.
One, two, three, four, JFK!
FDR!
Go, go ... that's the lava!
Down, down in the tunnel.
No.
I'm the President, you're the Vice President.
Joe Biden!
It's Abu n*zi!
Where?
No, no, no, no! Spin, spin, spin, spin!
Fly! Do the chicken dance!
No, no counter clock-wise?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Holly, you're in the Amber Waves of Grain.
You have to lose your jacket.
I...
Take off your jacket; She's right.
Those are the rules.
Is there, like, a printout of the rules I can see, or...?
No!
No!
I thought this was like music...
Howard Dean Scream.
Yeah!
God...
I am sorry I was crying so much.
God, that film, it just... it just reminded me how much I want to have kids, you know?
Was that just a really weird thing to say on a first date?
No.
Are you sure? It felt a bit weird.
Oh, my best friend has texted me, like, 12 times.
I get it ... you're just trying to get out of the date.
No, no, no ... no, this is real.
It's the kids thing. I knew it.
Some psycho keeps scratching at her door and then running away.
She's pretty sure it's the Calabasas Scratcher.
I mean, is that a thing?
What?
I don't keep up with local news.
I don't know, it's fine.
You don't have to lie to me.
I get it.
You can come with me.
Okay? Then you'll see.
Well, all right.
She's just like this.
Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!
Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!
Gettysburg, Bull Run.
Oh, no, oh, no, I think I fell ... oh, no.
In the course of human events, you must...
Surrender your shirt!
Fine, I'll take off my shirt.
He did it on purpose ... he did it to impress her!
U.S.A.
I am not...
I am not a crook!
I am not a crook!
What do you mean, man?
I took my shirt off! Wait! It's part of the game, you guys!
Up, up, up. I'm up! Oh, wow!
This footstool really reminds me of my ex.
Liar! Holly, Holly, look at these ... these are my abs.
Hard to believe that I used to be a great big fat person.
Oh, fat makes me so sad.
Yeah, it makes me sad, too.
I'm chubby... I'm a fat guy.
You look great, man.
I'm a fat boy.
Feel where the fat used to be?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's been replaced with phantom fat.
I still feel it jiggle.
Hey, Schmidt, your butt just violated the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act1
Westward Ho, son! Westward Ho.
Bye-bye, Schmidt.
Damn it.
Come on, all you got to do is talk to her, what's the big deal?
Okay, mm...
You're at the bar ... I'm Holly.
Boy, am I thirsty.
I was wondering if, like...
if you want... if you want, per chance, like...
"Per chance," really?
Hm? No, it's, uh...
You're a swell kind of gal.
Getting worse.
You come on out to the bar.
Hey, girl, what your name is?
Oh, my God.
What that thing do?
Oh, my God.
Out of all the gals in this...
God... what... you walked into mine.
Please.
Um...
Yeah, take a sip.
Okay, look, I think you're amazing.
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Yes, yes, I will.
Now give me that.
This coat is an unfair advantage ... take it off.
I love the coat.
Take the coat off!
Hey, Schmidt!
Hey, hey! No!
Order! Order!
All right, there's only one way to solve this.
Two of us have to go behind the Iron Curtain, which is that door there, and kiss.
And there has to be a "clear and present thr*at of tongue."
This is why I voted for you.
Holly, you ready for this?
Definitely against the president's order.
Ready?
Let's do the count.
The two, three or four.
So when we do this, do two.
Okay. Not three, not one, not four ... two.
A one or a three. Anything but a two.
Just not a two. Two. Do you hear me? Two. Not four.
One, two, three.
What are you doing? You said not to do a two!
I made it so clear!
No...!
No...!
...brought the change in!
Mulligan! Mulligan!
Holly, wait for me! I'm very sad!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Open the door! Open the door!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
I can see how in this second instance I might be considered a cooler...
if you want to label me.
You think?
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Okay, we kissed. Let us out. Sent you a picture.
That ain't no kiss, man!
Come on, Inspector Gadget, inspect those tonsils.
Just give Jess a tender, sensual kiss, and we will let you right out.
Shut up, Schmidt!
Schmidt, stay out of this!
Please stop yelling at me!
You know that I'm ten percent more emotionally fragile than Nick right now.
No, no, don't! No, please!
Don't! Don't!
Do you mind if I tell you a story?
Is it sad?
Holly, he's really happy!
He's got a 401K and a six-pack!
Well, it's the tale of an uber successful marketing executive's journey...
I'm hairy and chubby!
...into heartbreak.
Mm-hmm.
Her name was Cecelia.
No!
Come on, come on. Holly, wait!
Ugh! What is the big deal?
Let's just suck it up and French a little.
Okay, fine, but don't say
"Let's suck it up and French a little."
Okay, fine. Let's do this.
What were you doing?!
Well, I thought you're sitting on the ground.
No. I... Okay.
Uh!
Okay, Jess, hey, this is not a big deal.
Okay, not a big deal. Let's just do it.
Fine. Let's just do it.
Okay. Great, yeah.
Let's just do it.
Okay, cool.
Why are you licking your lips?
Should I not? Do you want dry lips? - No.
Then I'm just licking 'em to make 'em better.
Okay.
Fine.
Do it.
I'm doing it.
Fine, then do it.
Are you a tongue-er?
Am I a tongue-er?
I don't want to put my tongue in your mouth, if you don't like it.
Just kiss me!
Okay, all right, great.
That's what I'm gonna do.
All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two... I'm actually not gonna do a count.
Okay.
That's not my style when I kiss.
I don't count down before...
Okay.
I don't think so.
Okay.
Ready?
Yep.
I'm sorry. You can't do that.
What did I do?
Your face.
My face?
Yeah, you can't do that with your face.
Okay, I'll do something different with my face.
Okay, all right, great.
Wait ... you can't kiss with your teeth!
Okay, I can't ... no, I can't do this.
Well, you can't try to kiss me like a Joker and expect...
Okay, you're... let me out of here!
Let me out! Sometimes, I hear her name when the wind bl*ws.
Please!
Open the door! Cece.
You know, I left something behind in the desert that day:
My faith and true love...
and my future biracial child.
You, you kind of lost me there.
Not really doing it for me.
It's more depressing than sad.
It's not depress...
It's depressing.
It's sort of depressing.
No, no, no, it's not depressing.
It's not really doing it for me.
I'm gonna tell you why it's not depressing.
Because she is still in love with me.
I'm over it completely.
Having said that, it's so hard to move on.
Do-do you know what I mean?
Yes.
Can you help me move on, Holly?
You need help moving.
Can you heal my pain?
I can heal your pain.
Can you ple...
I can heal you.
Yeah, you can heal my...
Hey, Jess? Where's Jess? Jess, where are you? I came as fast as I can.
Cece, open the door!
Cece, don't worry! I'm just trapped I need to k*ll Schmidt!
Until I kiss Nick!
What?
You're the... She's the Cece?
Right there, in the flesh.
You are obsessed!
Cece, honey, you have to move on, okay?
You can't love somebody forever.
I'm sorry. You love that small shiny man?
No!
What do you mean, small, man?
None of this is true.
No, because I'm on a date.
Should we make out to make him jealous or something?
Are you lying to me? I really hate being lied to.
I would never lie to you. I haven't lied to you this whole time we've been in this loft ... that's a fact.
Cece, uh...
Hey.
...please tell me, in front of Holly, how much you still love me.
I'm sorry. Is this why we came here?
Please, I don't really know what that accent is. - English.
I speak English. That didn't sound like English.
It will be my final request, I promise, so both of us can move on.
'Cause I, you know, I'd really like to move on. - I get it.
I'd like to move on all night long with Holly.
Okay, I get it.
I'm only gonna say this one more time.
I always have and always will...
love you.
All right, all right, you know, this is the most elaborate way to get out of dating me that I've ever experienced, so...
Winny, it's Nicky.
Open the door, man!
I guess the game's over.
I thought we were working together.
I was gonna start on your confidence and work my way up to your facial hair.
What's your fiancé
gonna say about that?
Oh, this? I just wear it so guys don't h*t on me in bars.
Okay.
I'm single.
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.
Okay, I'm waiting.
Um, so...
Still waiting.
Don't say anything!
She sounds weird! Just let us out!
Just open the door.
Yeah.
C minus. You kiss like a damn bitch.
Oh, you're messing with me; Okay.
Little bit.
Nick, I'm gonna admit it.
I might be your cooler.
I chalk it up to bad timing.
Well, thank you for admitting that.
But to be fair, you are your own cooler
70% of the time.
Some basic grooming, Nick, and you'd be smoking hot.
I'd be smoking hot?
You'd be smoking hot.
You do want to kiss me, then.
All bets are off if you take a shower.
That is very nice of you.
Jess, are you okay? I got your message!
What's happening?
Sam, I'm so sorry. Yeah... here, I'll help you up. I'll help you up.
It was a false alarm.
All right.
What are you doing back there?
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Okay, let's just do this already.
Just kiss me.
No, I'm not gonna kiss you.
Kiss me!
Jess, stop!
God! Miller, just kiss me already!
No, not like this!
That, that...
What? What does that mean?
No, I didn't...
Nothing. I just, I didn't mean it like that.
I just, we can't like that because that's not... Do you know, like...?
It's very, like, you don't...
That's not what it...
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
If you'll excuse me.
Nick, what are you doing?
What are you do...?
I'm fine.
Nick!
I just have to move this, right here ... my back. Aah!
Okay, this makes sense.
What are you doing?!
I just need a little air...
What are you doing?!
This is what I needed. This is... Ah-ha-ha!
Nick, you don't have to kiss me!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Help! Help me!
I made a very bad mistake!
Nick, no! No!
Help me open this window! Help!
Don't jump!
Hold it right there!
You scared me half to death out there.
Are you not getting enough attention?
I'm fine! I am fine!
You wouldn't let me out.
I was partly joking!
Nick, we will talk about this in the morning.
Yes, we will. But first...
I'm gonna go do stuff with a girl.
Yeah!
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're okay.
I'm fine. I'm just, I got...
Hey, Nick, if you ever feel the urge to jump again, you call me.
Thank you.
I am genuinely afraid of her.
I wish you didn't do that.
Close the door.
Thank you.
That was freakin' hilarious!
I mean, Jess, he jumped out on a ledge instead of kissing you.
Can you believe that?
I'm an idiot.
Well, he's missing out.
You want to go to bed?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Nick!
The scratching's back.
All right, all right.
Jess, I'll take care of it.
Relax.
There's nobody there.
Admiral! Brian!
Admiral Hornbeck! Brian, down!
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Sometimes he gets out... Is that my coat?
What...?
I thought my package was delivered here.
It's her coat.
I was knocking and knocking.
Are you sleeping in it?!
I think he might have been.
Why?!
'Cause it's a fantastic coat.
It gives me confidence.
Man, that is a woman's coat.
What are you doing?
All right, well, this is not the...
Give her the coat, Nick.
I love this coat.
So much weird crap happens in this apartment.
He's really sorry.
God!
Well, I guess the old Nick is back, huh?
Yeah. I'm gonna miss Trench Coat Nick.
He was pretty great.
I might miss him.
I liked him.
He had guts.
It was a woman's coat.
Good night, Nick.
Good night.
I meant something like that.
Oh, uh, hey, babe, do you mind if I, uh, put this somewhere else?
It's kind of, it's kind of creeping me out when I'm trying to go to sleep.
Yeah, that's fine.
Cool.
That's fine.
Whew.
Oh, Cece. Are you two kids back together?
She wishes.
No, plumbing's out ... severe clogging.
I'm sorry I asked.
This is what happens.
Four models with protein deficiencies, sharing a shower.
They shed like a... like a four-dollar Christmas sweater.
Guys, guess what?
I just made a breakthrough with a student.
Yeah, it's true.
Don't, please.
Uh, Jess?
You know we love you, we all support you...
♪ I'm breaking through with students. ♪
...but when you do things like this, I'm sorry... bowl.
Okay.
It's just not satisfying.
I think it is.
Okay.
You said you had a breakthrough.
It's just a whole new world teaching adults.
This week, I gave them an assignment.
I said write whatever you want just load it up with descriptive imagery.
My fluffy pillow, my yellowy fluffy pillow, next to my dog, my hairy dog, my beloved hairy dog, while I diddle myself.
Excellent.
He was a merman.
He was the last of his kind, and he needed a mother for his mer-child.
He was not a mer-gentleman.
Can't wait to hear more.
I just can't connect with them and I don't know why.
Look, Jess, you can't teach people how to write.
Not true.
I say that as a writer.
Also not true.
A writing class is for somebody who doesn't think lyrically in terms of, like, poetic words that just... are strung...
You said you had a breakthrough.
So I have this student whose name is Edgar and he was not getting it.
And then today he turned in this amazing story.
Nick, actually, you should read this.
Writers don't read ... we write.
Jessica Day calls it
"A must read."
Look at that font.
What is this amateur hour?
At least use Palatino.
Good evening, everyone.
Or should I say morning?
Hey, Winston.
Do you guys have any agave?
We might have some pressed lentil syrup in the mixin's cabinet.
Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.
Okay, uh...
Okay, you know what?
Hey, look...
I just felt the side, the side anyway, so it's...
I didn't mean to...
It's fine, it's...
Other way, now.
I will fight you, Jack.
No, not again.
Not... no!
No!
Jump out the way, Jessica?
What the hell is wrong with you just waving that thing around like an idiot?
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess.
The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey here Guys, listen to this.
"By day, I'm a plumber.
By night, I'm a stalker."
You read it.
"I sit in the bushes wearing a gimp costume, stalking my prey."
He's the first person I got to use first person narrative.
♪ I'm an amazing teacher.
Very engaging, keep going.
I'm hooked.
Okay, "My prey is a deer.
"Her eyes are big, too big.
"Before she can blink those big eyes,
"I'm s*ab her.
"I s*ab and s*ab.
I love s*ab."
Sounds like he likes s*ab.
"After all the s*ab..."
It's repetitive, but...
"...I wash my hands in her dark red blood"?!
Listen to that detail.
This man is psychotic.
It's fiction.
There's no such thing as a gimp costume.
No, gimp costume's a real thing.
That's a real thing.
You've seen me in one before.
I just don't think you should be in a room with this creep, twice a week.
It is not safe.
Are you worried about me, Miller?
Yeah, I'm a little worried about you.
And if you won't do anything about it, then I'm taking into my own hands.
I'm doing a little investigation.
Investigating? Please.
You're just gonna Google his name.
I am way beyond that.
You're typing his name into Google.
We can all see the screen. See the screen, dude.
This is a private investigation!
Are you... I wanted to talk to you about the...
regrettable contact between Cece's...
her-her down there and my, uh...
my parts.
You practically shish-kebabbed her.
Is this something I should apologize for?
Just let it go, man.
You pogo'd her.
I'm sorry, what did you say, "pogo"?
I didn't, um...
I heard
"Pogo" ... what is that?
Look, Winston, fine.
It's what we call what you did this morning, okay?
It's a short... it's a shorthand.
Why do you have a shorthand, Schmidt, because it happens so often?
You pogo'd me once.
You pogo'd Jess twice.
Hey, it's not sexual.
Nick's never been pogo'd directly.
You did get his pizza one time... which, by the way, is a whole nother debate ... how did you not feel that?
Let me get this straight ...
you guys sit around and talk about this?
Your penis actually changed the channel, uh, when we were watching the Bears game once.
You don't think me, Nick and Jess talk about you behind your back?
Because we do.
You have more pogos than anyone.
You are completely misusing the word pogo.
You are the pogo king.
Pogo king.
Pogo king?
So I wanted to talk about your creative imagery assignments.
Wow, guys.
I really felt like I was buried under a giant, gleaming, powdery avalanche of adjectives.
Don't mean to interrupt, I just hear you're the best teacher of adults?
Oh, no.
I wonder if there's room for one more? - No!
How you guys doing? I'm Julius Pepperwood.
Not now, okay?
I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.
I'm here to learn how to write short fiction.
Oh, okay, Julius, just...
take a seat and, um, keep small.
I'm from Chicago.
Thin-crust pizza? No, thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
So, for a fun follow-up...
Sorry, I'm late.
No, problem, Edgar.
We're just going over our descriptive imagery.
I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you. Mr. Pepperwood?
I'm gonna move closer, if you don't mind.
No, you don't have to go... stay over there.
How you doing, pal?
I'm Julius Pepperwood.
Edgar.
What are you doing? If you don't mind me asking, why are you late today, Edgar?
Uh, traffic, it really k*lled me.
It k*lled you?
Mr. Pepperwood.
Would you say that it s*ab you?
Say that again?
How about glasses on or off?
Teach, if I keep them on, am I a bad boy?
Hey.
All right, honey, I'll take them off.
Whoa, that's a whole different lens to see that blue dress.
No.
Okay, let's refocus.
Um, let's talk about the, um, four classifications of conflict.
We talked about it last week.
It's in the workbook, um...
Anybody want to help me?
Four classifications of conflict?
Anybody? Anybody...
So, no one has signed up for office hours and I just want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.
- Adios.
Anything at all.
What are you doing?
Nothing, man, you look good in your Dockers.
What? Nothing happened. I'm Julius Pepperwood.
Let it go.
Whoops.
Why did you do that?
The wind.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's good. Oh, everything's fine, bro.
What's happening right now?
Sorry, Edgar, um, I really loved your story.
Um, I wanted to give you some notes ... is there any time you could come in... to office hours?
Yeah, that be really cool.
I'm really excited.
Um, I'm available anytime, so...
I'll check my calendar.
Yup.
Can't get service around here.
Wednesday I got to go to the bird store.
Uh, what about Wednesday afternoon?
He's my uncle.
Hey, Winston, I'm glad you're home.
I know what my pogo is.
It's that I dance kind of like a sea snake.
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.
What are you talk... I know this it, man.
Is it that I barge into people's showers?
It's my caterpillar eyebrows ... well, look.
They're gone.
Nick, you've gone way too far! Way too far.
Well, if you're here for Edgar's notebook, you're too late.
Where's the notebook?
Nick!
What's my one rule?
It's to not steal your yarn.
Don't steal my yarn, man.
It's my one thing.
But look at what was inside of his notebook.
Okay, he was doodling in class, Nick.
w*apon, dripping with blood?
That is not a doodle.
What are you, the doodle police?
There's no doodle police, are there?
Really?
I can't believe you still don't believe me.
Jessica...
Exhibit D.
He did this.
I'm going to Edgar's house, I'm looking for more proof.
No, Nick, you're not spying on the one student that I have a connection with.
I have the address right here.
No.
Give me the...
No!
I have the address memorized.
Fine, then I'm coming, too.
To bail you out of jail when you get arrested for trespassing.
Fine, then you'll see that I was right. - Fine!
And you'll also see who gets there first.
Maybe we should take one car.
Just, like, for the environment.
Yeah, that makes sense ... we can drive together.
Fine!
Fine!
It's my mole, isn't it?
Well, consider it gone.
Game, set, pogo.
Chill out, man, it's not your mole.
Just tell me, this is the worst.
This is not the worst, Schmidt ... the worst is actually knowing.
Knowing that your friends sit around every single night talking about your pogo.
What's a pogo?
Those brows don't freak you out?
Nah, I've seen worse.
A pogo is what your friends talk about when you leave the room.
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?
Uh... sh...
You guys talk about my toenails?
Never... talk about your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.
I know my toenails are a little rugged.
Woodsy.
I mean, I have never wondered if you could shimmy up a palm tree.
But it's because I have a keratin surplus, I mean...
They're not that bad, look at these things.
Aah! Schmidt!
Ew!
It looks like an open Swiss Army Kn*fe.
Most of them are hard, but one of them is really, really soft.
I know, I know, I know ... we'll just talk about what my pogo is.
What's my pogo?
Is it the way I say "pan"?
Pan, pan, pan.
Look, Cece, this is more of just a loft thing.
Just thank your lucky stars that you don't have calcified mongrel toes!
Things sound like a dang ol' crab.
There it is.
If anything's gonna go down, we need a safe word.
Nothing's gonna go down unless we make it go down.
If Pepperwood taught me anything ...
There's no Pepperwood.
Never get caught without a safe word.
We're gonna go with "apricot."
That's way too normal. We need to, like, go with something weird, like "dragon slippers."
What?
I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.
Why do you use
"apricot" so much?
What am I supposed to call them ... "sweet tangy b*lls"?
Don't call them "sweet tangy b*lls," Jessica.
Well, that's why we can't use...
Nick... Nick...
Nick, oh!
Shh! Come on...
Nick..
Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.
You look ridiculous.
If we're hiding from people, why does it matter what I call you?
I got my eyes and you get my six.
No, no, what does this mean?
I'm pretty sure this...
This means "right turn bicycle."
No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...
" It means "right turn."
Nick, seriously ... use your words.
Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.
Okay, these are my words.
Oh!
Apricot, apricot, apricot.
Close your mouth, close your eyes.
Edgar lives with his mother. Of course he does.
So? A lot of normal people live with their mothers.
Like my Uncle Randy.
He can't go near parks.
He was cleared.
You've got to...
Apricot! Apricot!
Get over here now!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What's in that duffel bag?
He's the plumber from the story.
How did I not see this before?
What was I saying?
Oh, my God, you were right.
Yes, say that again, say that again. You were right, you were right, you were right about everything.
Don't ever forget you're saying it!
Oh, my God, I can't believe you were right.
I was a right about everything!
What the hell is in that duffel bag?
I don't know.
No, Nick.
Nick, you're gonna get us k*lled.
Let's get down.
Nick... Nick...
Shh.
♪ I'm so excited...
Oh, my... Jessica, turn it off.
Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.
What do I do?
You turn it... Here.
Turn it off. I don't know how to do this. - Okay.
Oh, my God. Get the hell out of here.
Jess, what are you doing?
That is ridiculous. There was plenty of room.
It seemed like a good idea.
Why would you go under a van?
Let's leave.
Keep still... You will not believe what just happened.
Nick was right.
I was right.
Oh, my God, what happened to your eyebrows?
You look like Audrey Hepburn.
Don't we own an industrial-size paper cutter?
Ugh!
Oh, whatever.
What the hell is that?
So close to the eating area!
Winston told me that you guys make fun of my gremlin toenails.
That you call them "clickety-
clacks" or "centaur boots."
What is wrong with you, Winston?
What is wrong with me? Besides my pogo.
I told him. It just kind of popped out.
You understand what that's like, right, Winston?
Okay, you know what? Don't act like we don't talk about you two behind your backs.
Because we do. You both have pogos, my friends.
Okay, let's take a deep breath and ask ourselves if this conversation is worth ruining our friendships over.
Tell me my pogo.
I need to know my pogo.
You guys need to tell me. I can take it. Lay it on me!
You know, it's kind of a loft thing. Is it my pies?
Are they too tart?
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?
My koala claws, now that's a pogo!
At least you can hide your pogo in a shoe.
They make shoes for your penis ... they're called pants!
Tell me my pogo.
Jessica, no.
Tell me my pogo!
You're a know-it-all!
Huge know-it-all.
The worst.
Oh, I'm the worst know-it-all in the world?
Please. Hate hyperbolic speak. Please.
Now you know your pogo, you truly know it all.
There I go being a smart-ass again.
I mean, that, that could be my pogo.
And then there was one.
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure that you guys have stuff you laugh at me behind my back.
We don't laugh about your pogo, Nick.
Yeah. We're worried about you.
You're worried about me?
We're worried that you're not gonna make it.
Make it to what?
Just in general.
'Cause you don't take care of yourself.
Sometimes I'll crumple up vitamins and I'll put them in your food.
We all take turns sneaking money into your pants pockets before we put them in the dryer.
Yeah? Well, I hope you're happy.
The pogos are out.
The loft dynamic is ruined.
But what if I talk like a baby?
You're still hot. That's all we're gonna talk about.
A tiny little baby!
Cut into these, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh...! A ladder...
That'll do.
Okay, okay.
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is... this is very bad.
Oh, no, oh, no ... no, no-
no-no-no-no ... oh, God, oh, God.

Hello.
Jess, he wants to k*ll you!
What...?
I am in his shed right now What?
And there are drawings on the wall of you, and bloody w*apon and googly eyes.
Googly eyes are actually kind of sexy, but that's beside...
Jess, I will not let you be in a room alone with this guy.
You're the deer in his story.
He wants to k*ll you.
You're the deer, you're the deer, you're the deer.
I'm at school and I'm doing office hours...
Get out now! Okay, I'll just, I'll just keep you on the line, and then I'll say the safe word, okay?
I'll just say it like... Apricots! Apricots!
Good. Yeah, yeah, that's what you say if you see Edgar.
Apricots! Really, apricots!
Oh, no. Okay, okay, stop it.
He's there. Okay.
I thought it was gonna be
"dragon slippers."
Is this a bad time or...?
No, no, no, no. I just have a deaf grocer.
Apricots! Apricots!
And butter.
I'm coming.
Oh! Ho-ho!
Welcome to office hours. Um...
I found my ending.
Yeah?
It's pretty risky. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get away with it.
Oh!
Remember when you told me to base my characters on people from my own life?
Well, I based one on you.
So flattered.
And then I realized that there was only one way for the story to end.
You need to die.
Apricot, apricot.
No! ♪ Hey...!
♪ Uh, uh-uh-uh...!
♪ Look at that notebook.
You said, "Great literature is surprising."
What's more surprising than k*lling your main character?

Imagine coming to the end of the book, and then just finding a lot more book.
Surprise.

Okay, but your drawings, they don't have any eyes.
Hate drawing eyes. It's weird.
He can't draw eyes.

Bitch.
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Hey, man.
Hey, take this as a compliment, pal.
Your stories are so real.
Well, it's because what you taught me.
You listened?
Well, of course I listened. You were a good teacher.
Until you thought I was a m*rder and you broke into my shed.
Aw! You were my favorite student until I thought you were a m*rder.
Ah...
Your son's a really great writer.
He's not my son.
Oh! Are you kidding?!
Really?!
Real nice, you two.
Come here, baby.
Mm! God, you smell like waffles.
I love it. Did you just make some waffles?
Want to eat me up?
Yes, I do.

Yes, do.
Okay.
Hey, Nick.
Hey.

Okay, did you...?
Great.
It's just what bacon needs, more fat.
And salt.
What's this?
Don't read that. I'm not finished...
"Julius Pepperwood:
Zombie Detective"?
All his m*rder victims are already d*ad, so they obviously don't need a detective. I'm working on it.
"The night was inky hot."
Don't do this.
"She strode into his office with a sense of purpose, place, another word here, question mark."
I'm looking for another
"P" word there.
"She had zombie legs that went on for miles.
"They were the kind of legs you could sink your teeth into.
"Pepperwood had two friends ... one, if you count his hat.
The other was his gal Friday, Jessica Night."
It's not you, Jess.
"She was small in stature, but not in spunk.
And a super annoying know-it-all."
Good evening.
Hello.
Oh, bacon.
Where the hell did you come from?
I came from my room.
No, I didn't hear the pitter-
patter of your disgusting feet.
I cut my toenails. Yeah, the soaking really worked.
Look at that. They're gorgeous now.
Went down a full shoe size.
Guys! f*re!
Whoa, whoa!
Oh, my God!
Everybody relax! Call a fireman!
You call the fireman!
I'm the fireman.
You can't put out a grease f*re with water!
You have to smother it!

You're so stupid!
Shut up!
Whoo! Oh!
Nice!
Yes!
Amazing, my man! Whoa. Whoa.
Honestly, I didn't know you were gonna put your arm around me.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, you put up your pup tent in front of the f*re.
It's involuntary.
It is a combination of adrenaline and great circulation.
And I'd appreciate it if you don't just hug me randomly!
That's weird and...!
You ever notice... when Winston runs, that he kinda farts while he's running? - Yes!

The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey here
All right, Nick, we believe in you, man.
Tell us, what's in the cup?
Ah, it's a hard one.
It's a mini carrot.
Onion and potato?
Dumbest boy in all the world.
How are you so bad at Feely-Cup?
You are awful at this game.
Sea glass? I'm overthinking it.
If his life depended on this, he would die.
Battery.
When are batteries squishy?
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding ... I know it's not a battery.
I'm kidding. Feel, Nick.
Nick, will you be paying for bonus time?
He can't;
He is all out of quarters.
Uh, Nick?
Your dad's here.
Very funny, Schmidty, but my concentration will not be broken.
Hey-ya, Nickels.
Come on, kid, bring it in.
Come on!
Hello, Mr. Miller. Welcome to our home.
Feely-Cup?
Oh, yeah.
Bring it on.
Watch this.
Tampon...
Wrapped in duct tape...
And dipped... in baking powder.
Is that what it is? Oh, it is.
Boom!
Next level Feely-Cup.
Hello, Mr. Miller.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
This is a pleasant surprise.
What brings you to Los Angeles, Dad?
Let me just, uh, clean up a little bit.
You know, I just thought I'd stop by.
I'll sleep in your bed, you can go on the couch.
Sounds like us.
Hey.
So, what does Mr. Miller do?
Businessman. - A what?
He's a con man.
He is a con man. - He is a damn business ... What are you talking about?
He's a con man.
He's a businessman.
Winston's obsessed with Walt.
That moustache first of all ... what?!
It's like the world's sexiest push broom.
A con man like,
"What's the play?"
The, uh, Ring-A-Doo Johnnycakes?
The, uh, Hollow Leg Swap-Em-Out?
Yes, exactly.
Fake trombones for a fake band.
Harold Hill!
Music Man?
No, he is not a con man, okay?
You know, he sometimes used to sell hats.
There you go, boys ... enjoy.
Thanks, Dad.
So many hats.
Okay, technically, they were misprints.
This says:
"Chica Go Bills."
Let's go, guys ... these hats suck.
"Chica Go Bills" is, uh, actually Spanish for "Young girl, go Bills."
Who's gonna mess with a guy who's wearing a hat that says,
"Young girl, go Bills?"
I mean, the answer is everybody.
They will, they mess with you.
Oh, my... Nick, please do not angry-fix the sink.
I'm not angry-fixing;
I'm fixing!
You want to know why I'm messed up?
Why I don't trust people?
Why I have anger issues?
Oh, yes, I do want to know.
Why I have the blood pressure of a hummingbird?
Do you think this is maybe about your dad?
And so Nickels comes
into my room screaming,
"Daddy, Daddy."
So I go,
"What's wrong?"
He says, "Daddy, I have a tick at the end of my tinkle."
Oh, my God!
This is not a story for everyone.
And sure enough, there is a tick at the end of his little penis.
Not a story for this moment.
That's how he got the nickname "Little Penis."
Oh, stop calling me that.
What are we gonna do with this guy?
I have no idea, Pop-Pop.
Don't call him Pop-Pop.
That's his nickname.
The nickname is longer than Walt.
But that's the nickname that I gave him. - Yeah, but it's really weird that you call my dad Pop-Pop.
I like Pop-Pop.
You don't get it. You don't get it.
Yeah, fine, just don't call him Pop-Pop, so...
I think it's time for another drink.
What do you say, gorgeous?
You want to give an old man a hand?
Sure.
I don't know, Nick.
A lot of charm coming from this end of the booth.
'Cause that's what he does.
He lures you in with his charm and his moustache and his perfect hair.
I feel like you need to talk to him about this.
Right, 'cause I'll just tell him how I feel, and everything will be okay
'cause that's really the way the world works.
Took the words right out of my mouth, Little Penis.
It's not a thing.
I love a good nickname.
Not... not gonna stick.
You know, when Nick is not working here, the service is abysmal.
I mean, how many times did I have to repeat the words, "Lemon Drop sh*t"?
Yeah, I think he was making fun of you.
For what?
Working hard and playing hard?
I guess the joke is on me.
Another Indian guy?
My mom set me up.
Oh, your mom.
That's cool.
Mm-hmm.
Have fun with your, your Devs...
and your... and your An-Anujs...
or your Deepaks.
Whatever Patel you're dating.
I'm-I'm not sweating it.
His name's Pavun, Pavun Shetty.
What?
As in, as in "Shetty Solutions"?
I think so. Why?
They only nailed the crowd-control logistics of b*mb's revamped open-air market.
I thought you weren't sweating it.
I'm not sweating it. Sweating it.
k*lling me with that Drop, dude.
You really seem to care about Little Nicky.
I mean, look at him.
He looks like Hilary Swank mixed with a sad, wet dog.
Do you think he's really angry at me?
I think you need to talk to him.
All I'm looking for is a second chance.
You don't happen to believe in second chances, do you, Blue Eyes?
Actually, I, um...
I'm a bit of a sucker for second chances.
They're my first favorite kind of chance.
Have you ever been to the racetrack?
Back at the tracks with my dad.
When Nick was a kid, he would come to the track with me all the time.
And if I got in trouble, he would get me out of it by doing the Sugar Ray.
Oh, the Sugar Ray.
What's a Sugar Ray?
It's when I pretend to be a diabetic kid so the man who is thr*at to b*at up my father would run off scared.
You see, we did have some good times, didn't we?
Now, come on, let's make a bet.
Here you go.
What's the catch?
What catch? There is no catch.
What possible catch can there be?
All I want you to do is make a bet.
All right, Pop, you want me to lose your money?
I'll be happy to.
Schmidt.
Robby?
Robby, what are, what are you doing here, man?
I'm spying on Cece.
Cece.
You know, I'm still in love with her, so...
this is pretty much your basic broken-hearted spying thing.
It's why I got this hat.
Aw, come on, Robby, you got to get over that.
Wait a second, are you spying on Cece, too?
No. What?
Are you still in love with Cece?
No, that's still...
Yes, I am.
It's k*lling me.
Me, too! Bring it in, man.
What are you two doing here?
Whoa, hey.
Cece?
Just nothing, we're just...
Yeah, you know.
Do you think that she saw me?
What? Of course she saw you.
Do you think she saw me?
Well, yeah, you don't have a hat on.
Nicky only had one dream when he was a kid ...
to own a family horse.
That is so surprising 'cause it just doesn't seem like...
Nick hates living things, so, like, it just doesn't really seem like in line with what I know about him.
All right, look...
I want to buy a horse.
Uh-huh.
For me and Nick to own together.
Oh!
I found this beautiful horse.
Gorgeous!
Right.
Me and you are gonna talk the guy down.
I don't know how to do that.
I'll take care of that.
Okay.
Hey-ya, Dusty.
Aw, ya gotta be kidding me!
How'd he find me?
Who was that?
Eh, don't worry about him.
What do you know about horses?
I know they're big.
Perfect.
This is a very sad case.
I mean...
My niece, she goes to veterinary school.
We're all very proud of her.
Top of my class.
So, what do you, uh, what do you think?
Terrible horse.
She's very sickly.
He. He... He.
He... He.
Oh!
I wish I had brought my stethoscope.
I'm seeing a lot of split ends.
The mane is totally the wrong cut for the shape of his face.
So you're saying that this horse, right now, the way it is, will never race again?
Damn it, Uncle Buck!
This horse will never race again!
Why did you fly me all the way out from Grenada if you weren't gonna listen to me?
Yes, con!
Shh, shh, shh!
Okay, there are people in life who you want to be unpredictable.
Your pothead neighbor, or Vice President Joe Biden.
And then there are people who you don't want to be unpredictable, like your dentist, or, I don't know, your father.
Look, Nick, my dad left when I was three.
Every single day, rain or shine, he just never came back.
I wish he'd been a little bit more unpredictable;
That's all I'm saying.
I hear you.
And yeah, sure, Walt may owe me a couple hundred bucks, but it's not a big deal.
My dad owes you money? How much?
Three, 400... like 1,100 bucks.
Oh, my God, he's with Jess.
He's gonna rip her off.
He's gonna rip her off.
I feel like Cece's making a big mistake with this Indian guy.
She should be with somebody like us.
Totally.
White Guy Power.
Okay, um...
Cool Guy Power.
Now you're talking, Robby.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
I mean, one billion Indian men is a daunting foe.
Suddenly I feel sympathy for Pakistan.
But it's like they say,
"How do you eat an elephant, Robby?"
With chopsticks.
What?
Slowly, with chopsticks.
That's ... no ... with chopsticks?!
In a taco.
What?
Elephant tacos.
Elephant tacos? Who eats elephant tacos?
That's not even a saying.
Oh.
One bite at a time, Robby.
One bite at a time.
Yes.
One bite at a time. This is what I'm thinking.
I use my superior powers of manipulation and persuasion to get Cece to take you back.
Once we've neutralized the sub-continental thr*at, I smite you.
What?
What?
You said you're gonna smite me?
Smite ... defeat gloriously for Cece's hand.
No, I know what it means.
But that's someday.
For now, let's scheme, my "broheem."
Okay... I just want to reiterate that I'm not on board with the smiting.
Whatever.
But I like the "broheem" thing a lot.
Let's concentrate on the broheem part.
Concentrate on... okay.
And smite later.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Cheers, broheem.
You got a great deal.
Good luck, Doc. - Thanks.
Dad!
Hi, boys.
Can I tell him?
I would rather keep it a secret.
Nick, your dream finally came true.
We got you a horse.
It's not my dream to own a horse.
What?
Did you use my friend to buy a horse?
What? No, I swore you wanted...?
Will you excuse me? I gotta take this call.
That is unbelievable, Dad.
He had this whole thing ... he was gonna name the horse "A Father's Love"
'cause you guys always wanted to have a horse together.
Tell me you didn't give him money.
Actually, actually, that's a funny story because I'm actually an investor in...
God!
God!
Walid, drop d*ad!
Damn, Pop-Pop.
Stop calling him Pop-Pop!
Now, listen, I already got people standing by to take the horse off our hands.
Horse semen in Dubai is gold.
No, you can't sell "A Father's Love."
There's more to "A Father's Love" than just semen.
Ew, poetic, but ew.
Dad.
Dusty, I see you and we're doing this right now.
No, no, no, no, no...!
Dusty!
We got your back, Pop-Pop.
Damn, Pop-Pop, man.
Give me that.
Okay, okay, okay!
Father, we got your back, Father.
Five hundred dollars?
You stole $500 from her to buy that horse?
I didn't steal anything from her.
She saw the opportunity for a business investment, and she took advantage of it. I mean...
Dad, she will believe anything.
That's not true, Nick.
My real name is Jamil.
It is?
No, my name is not Jamil!
Nick, that was not fair.
It is Nick, you know that!
You told me in confidence.
How could you think my name was Jamil?
Well, he's weird.
That's a good point.
Just wait for one hour.
You see, I go meet the buyer, I sell them our horse for a huge profit, and because these suckers think our horse is Big Brown's nephew, they'll overpay.
Blue Eyes gets her money back with interest.
Sounds like a great plan. We'll come with you.
And I'll watch you give Jess her money back.
Yeah!
Please, please, don't do this to me.
We're doing it. No, no, you...
You don't understand, you're not a sales guy, okay?
He... he starts to sweat.
Nick only sweats if there's lying involved.
And there's not lying involved, is there?
We're coming with, Dad.
Check this out.
We get seersucker suits...
Yeah.
And two more guys, and then we serenade her with a barbershop quartet.
Well, if we got ten more guys and a plan, we'd form an Ocean's Twelve.
I would be Brad Pitt, you'd be the crafty Asian fellow who does the, uh, who does the flippies.
Oh, I got a great idea.
We can name a star after her, all right?
I know this Web site, and we could put one that's right near the Robbies one through eight.
You have eight stars? - There's, like, a billion stars, they're really cheap.
But eight of them are yours?
That's only going to go up in value.
It's a horrible investment.
I know she's into that Gandhi crapola.
We could self-immolate.
I feel like we're so close.
Wait, Robby.
I got it.
Cool... Guy... Power!
Cool... Guy... Power!
Cool Guy Power! Cool Guy Power!
Cool ... hey.
Is this happening?
Yes.
Why are the two of you even together?
Are you wearing a traditional sari?
Yes.
I begged you to wear a sari.
I had all these sari-related sexual scenarios.
Shh!
"Monsoon Bedding."
"The Best Erotic Mari-bone Hotel."
Stop that.
"Slum-Doggy-Style Millionaire"
But, what, you're wearing the sari for who? Let me see this guy.
No! What... Schmidt! Robby!
You're wearing it for him...
Oh, my God.
Are you... you're having an orgy here? - Mm-mm.
This is a big Indian orgy?
Oh, for God sakes.
They're all wearing their clothes...
I'm telling you, it's an orgy.
Pavun and I can't go on a date until our families...
meet.
We saw you on a date earlier.
That wasn't a date.
I was meeting Pavun's uncle, Manish.
Manish.
That is Pavun.
Oh, that's Pavun. Oh, my God, look at this guy, he's gorgeous.
What are you talking about?
I don't have a chance here. Look at his features.
Look at your features, man.
You're just as gorgeous.
I mean, kind of.
You're kind, you always have gum...
and you've got so much pep.
You know what, You are confident, and you're punctual, and you came up with this awesome plan.
Yeah, we came up with this awesome plan.
Together. - You know what, screw it, I don't even care anymore.
White Guy Power!
That's "white guy."
All right, man.
Let's do it. All right. White Guy Power.
You got to quit it with that, man.
I'm telling you, it's a little r*cist.
Get out of here before I throw you out.
All right.
He is so organized, you know?
I am just... I'm learning a ton.
I'm ready for this. This is good.
This is really exciting.
This is my first middle of the night parking lot horse deal.
This is not gonna work, they're gonna...
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.
Gonna work fine.
Take control of this, please.
I got it, I got it. Yes.
We got it. We got it, Walt.
Hey, look, will you do me a favor, please?
Let me handle this. Just because my dad is in town, I'm not gonna put you in harm's way.
Yup. Okay.
Twist my arm.
I'll be the lookout.
Just keep your head down.
I've got this totally under control.
Hi-ya, fellas.
How you doing?
Eh, I'm good. You?
I'm good.
Just getting over a little cold.
Yeah, I get a little agita myself every once in a while.
Hey, what's going on, everybody? How you guys doing?
Nice to see you. This is my dad; I'm Nick.
Cool half-turtleneck.
How you doing, fellas?
Good.
Just getting over a little cold.
Good.
He makes the white?
This horse is more semen than he is horse.
That's disgusting.
Good. We want semen.
Well, you guys are gonna get semen.
You'll get a bunch of horse semen.
Wait until it's next to a lady horse.
Trust me.
What's the matter? Is sweat?
I don't see sweating. He's not sweating.
Why he sweating so much?
No, no, no, I don't sweat too much.
Why is... are you a cop?
Cop?
No, no, no, no!
Sweat like a cop.
Take off your clothes.
Why would I do that?
Aw, just take off your clothes.
Take it now. - He just wants to see that you're not wearing a wire.
I would like you to defend me here.
Now! Take it off!
Take it off.
No.
Now! Take it off!
Take off your clothes!
Take off your clothes!
Take off your belt!
Take off your belt.
Now, dance.
Turn around. Turn around.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, look, look, He's got no wire.
He's not... he's not a policeman, he's...
Guys, I'm not wearing a wire.
I'm not a cop.
I just sweat like this when I'm lying.
Lying?
Lying?
No.
Nobody is lying.
No...
You lying to me?
Tire iron! Tire iron!
You're lying!
What is he doing?
The... the gum!
The gum had sugar in it.
These guys are weird.
Weird.
Strange!
You're weird.
Now you have to talk to each other!
You've been conned.
God, I'm good.
That's not a con, Jess!
You're just driving away.
I was ready to get your friend's money back for her, okay?
But you insisted on coming here.
You know what?
You know what's funny about you?
Somehow, you have made this...
seem like my fault.
This isn't my fault!
I didn't invite you here!
Keep talking.
This is good for you guys.
Are you angry at me about something, Little Penis?
I have been mad at you for 30 years, Dad.
30 years?
I am not a successful adult.
I don't eat vegetables and/or take care of myself.
And it's because of you.
Well, okay, maybe I'll take a little bit of that h*t.
Look, it's not "taking a h*t."
It's just saying sorry.
I think you look cold. I'm gonna give you my pants.
I don't want your pants.
Come on, take the pants!
Dad, please don't do that.
You say I do nothing for you.
Let me give you my pants.
I don't want your pants!
Don't do this. Please don't do this.
Take my pants.
This is making it worse!
Dad, the...
This is ridiculous.
Okay.
All right, maybe, uh...
maybe I did make some mistakes along the line, okay?
We all make mistakes, Dad.
Hey, what do you say, tomorrow, we go to a game?
Any game, you pick it out.
I'm in.
You're welcome! Son of a...
This thing doesn't turn so well.
Do you think Cece and Pavun will make it?
I don't know.
Really can't say.
What I can say is that one arranged marriage did take place today.
The marriage of Schmidt and Robby.
Hell, yeah.
I only dread the day that we defeat all the Indians, and must face each other in a duel to the death.
Yeah.
Buzz k*ll.
We're like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
Except only one of us dies at the end of the movie.
It's gonna be you.
You're the one that's gonna die.
You want another beer?
Sure do, compadre.
Hey, Walt.
What are you doing?
I thought you were gonna go to a game with Nick today.
Going to get a bagel.
In Chicago.
No! No, I can't...
No. Um, I can't let you go.
This means too much to Nick.
You can't just say you're gonna do things and then not do them.
What was that?
What was what?
That.
What? What?
Damn, you're good.
Listen, Blue Eyes, do me a favor, will ya?
Will you tell him for me that I, uh...
You know, that I...
Just keep an eye on him for me, will ya?
Jess, if you're gonna mess with my sink, put some goggles on.
Your eyes are twice the size of normal eyes;
It's a bigger target.
Walt's gone.
I know how hard it was for you to talk to him, and I just...
some people, I just don't under... they just ... aah!
And I understand why you want to break pipes now.
Let's just drink a bunch and destroy the sink.
I don't need to break the pipes, Jess; I'm fine.
I mean, truth be told, I was happy to see him.
I thought if you talked to him that maybe...
No... Look, Jess...
people don't change.
If someone's broken, they just stay broken.
You're not broken.
I'm a little broken.
No, no, no... no.
Oh, yeah.
You should be so much worse.
Seriously, you could be picking up calls on a banana.
You could be, like,
"Hello?"
I don't know how you made it out.
But... you're good.
Well, look, there's a lot I don't tell you.
I haven't done laundry in five months.
I'm not wearing underwear.
I'm just wearing a big sock right now.
Really.
A big sock.
A very big sock.
I got it.
What do you think about this?
We get a three-person canoe, okay?
Then we got to her house and we rap on the door.
She answers the door, she sees the three-person canoe.
She realizes there's only two of us, and we say, "Ah, what a conundrum. Please join us."
How about this one? We get some night-vision goggles.
All right, that's all I got.
I don't... I don't know what else.
I mean, I would say Trojan horse, but...
In this economy? - I mean, we could always go on a hunger strike.
We enlist in the Navy, we quickly rise through the ranks, and then we can take her to the Naval Officer's Ball. - Feel like we're right there!
Just come, Nick. Why not?
Angie and I are not romantic weekend types.
Sounds like you need some fresh air in a cabin You're dating a stripper.
I'm dating a tall, handsome doctor.
We're both kind of living the dream.
We're not "dating."
What Angie and I have together is pure anarchy in like, a sexy, cool way.
Oh, yeah? - Look at what she did while I was sleeping.
Look at how cool that is.
She doodled on your armpit?
It's not a doodle, it's a tat.
Of poodle hair?
It's not poodle hair. It's like the, uh...
Anyway, no to the cabin.
All right.
And why do you want us to come on your romantic weekend anyhow?
I thought it was just supposed to be you and the doctor.
Okay, I'm a little nervous.
I just need backup.
I want this weekend to be fun and perfect and lovely, and I want him to look at me at the end and go,
"Jess, that was the best weekend I ever had."
I'm glad you're keeping your expectations at a reasonable level.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Roast marshmallows, Yeah.
Make a f*re, Oh, yeah.
And sleep on a bear rug.
You in?
Ooh, no.
Jess, I'm sorry. We're not going this weekend.
All right.
But it's free.
You say free?
Yep.
Yeah, we're 100% in.
I'll go pack now.
Okay.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
==special thanks to err0001==
Oh, wait, wait, wait, keep this in mind, right?
Now, I have a spatula in my hand the entire time, and I'm looking her directly in the eye, and I say,
"You're damn right I want some cake."
Kind of weird.
Hey, what's up? Guys, this is Schmidt.
Hey.
Ready to go?
Yeah, no, let's do it.
It's nice meeting you all.
Hey, uh, Winston, who are those guys?
I don't know, I just met them on the way to the bathroom.
But you were so light and charming.
You were like Pixar Winston.
Yeah, we were just chilling, man, just having a conversation.
We can stay, if you want.
No, Schmidt, I don't want to stay.
I want to eat.
Come on, man.
White Nick, brown Cece.
I'd like to have a frank discussion about race.
Do you think that we're allowing Winston to be his blackest self?
I'm not gonna do this. - Okay, make sure Jess gets these, okay?
Guys, please, I'm being serious.
Okay, Schmidty, I know that you're being serious, but look, Winston has been black his entire life.
I think he knows how to handle it.
We were out the other night for drinks, and well, he encountered some members of his own, and you should have seen the way that he lit up.
I mean, he was like a glow stick.
This is terrible. - Whatever you were gonna do, please do not.
Just don't do it.
I want to create an environment within this loft where Winston feels free, where the gates are open. Let's let Winston turn on his-his black switch and let his black light shine.
This is perfect.
Yes, it is a weekend in the woods.
I'm just glad that we get to spend some time together.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah!
Oh, look, it's Jackie O.
Me? All right, thanks.
Yeah, you.
Sorry we're late. I had to stop and buy this bitch-ass a helmet.
Because he wouldn't stop being a bitch-ass.
The helmet we got at a rest stop, the shades are mine.
Yeah.
Free cabin! Whoo!
It's actually my boss's cabin.
That's great! Whoo!
Yeah! USA, USA!
Indian food, dinner? You down?
I thought maybe we'd eat at a place where you wanted to eat at tonight, Winston.
As a strong black man.
What?
What are you talking about?
Hey, man, I get it.
There are just some nights where I'm dying for my zadie's egg salad, pastrami piled a mile high, some matzo, kreplach...
Let's eat some soul food.
Schmidt, I want Indian, southern Indian.
Also, I got you something.
Jah rastafari. - Take this damn thing off my head.
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right.
Forget the hat. Just, I made a mistake.
I just...
Winston, tonight is about you.
I want to be the black friend that you never had.
I have black friends, Schmidt.
I want you to feel supported.
I want you to be able to do the things that you don't feel like I understand.
Okay. So that means you're gonna do whatever I say?
I mean, as long as it's gangster.
Or not. It doesn't have to be gangster.
Well, Schmidt, I want to say thank you for allowing me to be me and I look forward to sharing my people's culture with you tonight.
I've never played sexy Boggle before.
I'm gonna get into that later.
Ow-ooh!
Oops. Okay.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, we were just unpacking.
We could hear very clearly. Very clearly.
Hey, you got a high-pitched scream, man.
Yeah, I do.
So, you guys, we are playing best of 35, um, 'cause I thought you guys were gonna hang out with us.
Oh, Angie, this is my boss's cabin.
Oh! This is it!
Where were these when we were having sex?
That's how I feel. What?
Let's go sh**t things.
Yeah.
Okay.
Not scared.
Just be careful, please.
Good, yep.
Yeah!
All right, well...
That's all right.
Sam, are you having fun?
'Cause I really, really want you to have fun.
Course I am. I'm here with you.
Good.
You know?
Okay, good.
Drink hot cocoa.
It's not much fun without someone f*ring back.
You're amazing!
Wow!
That is not safe.
That is really reckless.
You want to sh**t g*n, don't you?
Go on.
Guys, guys! Save a b*llet!
Could be a little bit closer.
Got to be kidding me.
How do you keep missing?
Come on!
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
No g*n safety for us, right?
Want to sh**t?
No, no, no, do not give her a g*n. She cannot handle having a g*n, trust me.
All right, you know what, yeah, give me the boom stick.
The what? It's not called a boom stick. It's a r*fle. So...
What? Give me the r*fle.
Oh, right.
Whoa, yeah, you know what?
I feel powerful.
Whoa! Come on now!
Come on! Hey!
Okay, all right.
Nobody better...
Hey! Jess!
Hey!
Jess, thanks.
Are you nuts?
Here, all right, see that can?
Yep.
All right.
But I need like, a back story.
Like, why am I mad at the can?
That can is your ex-boyfriend, and, uh, he did not respect your space and, um, thought that your arts and crafts section of your house was ridiculous.
What?
And, right, done? Enough?
Yeah. No. Yeah.
Yeah. - Let me just square your hips right there.
All right, center your... there you go.
Now let me just move your hair.
It's so pretty, really curly.
Thanks.
Fantasy and nightmare colliding.
Take a deep breath.
Congrats.
We have no power.
Uh...
I'm just gonna...
Whoa! Jess, that's it. Let go of the r*fle.
I mean it; You're done. You're done.
Jess, I'm having a great time.
Oh, yeah, I'm so mad at you right now.
Guys, I think that this just turned into an adventure.
Look what I found in the owner's closet.
Yes!
Thank you so much.
You rule.
This is good stuff.
See, making the best of the night. Sweaters.
A little mothy.
Look what else I found in the owner's closet.- What?
Crème de menthe, guys.
Oh, get in here, girl.
Oh, body warmth.
Take a pull.
Ooh, yeah.
pass her over.
Ooh, that's...
Yeah.
That is not crème de menthe.
That is, uh, the green fairy right there.
It's absinthe.
Yeah, it's absinthe.
Absinthe?
Absinthe...
Nice.
Has k*lled so many of our most famous painters.
Last time I tried absinthe, I tried to put my car in my pocket.
Come on.
Let's get crazy.
Come on, babe.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Perfect weekend!
No, no!
No!
Whoa, too much.
Oh, guys.
I don't feel anything.
Well, those were just the best
ribs that I've ever had.
Ooh, you ain't lying, child.
Thanks for dinner, Schmidt.
You know, I really appreciate it, man.
I do feel supported.
So what's next?
There is this one thing that I miss.
I probably shouldn't say, man.
I can't.
No, come on.
It's us, man.
Schmidt, I could really go for some cr*ck.
What?
cr*ck cocaine?
I remember when I was a kid, me, my mom, and her mom, and well, her mom, and then her mom, and then of course her mom, and then my little cousin, Peanut, they'd all rush back to that flaming trash can where we'd sit around and harmonize and just... ♪ shoo-op. ♪
One of those nights I remember, well, we ran out of cr*ck.
I'd grab my scarf, and I would run on down to the liquor store where the thugs hang out, and I would try to get a good deal on some cr*ck.
Whoo! They never would give me a good price, man, but, uh, I tell you what, there's nothing like the... the feel of a f*re, a fresh-baked cookie, and that sweet, sweet taste of cr*ck in your lungs.
Okay.
Okay, Winston, yeah.
Sure, I mean, if...
If that is something that you want to do...
See, I knew you were gonna judge me.
I knew it.
No, Winston.
I knew you were gonna judge me and just...
Winston, listen to me.
Look...
if cr*ck cocaine is what you want then cr*ck cocaine is what we are going to get.
How do we do this?
Here's what we do, Schmidt. We go to the projects, okay?
We knock on some doors.
I'll wait in the car and take lookout while you do all the legwork.
Because as you say, you are in much better shape than I am.
You do have the body of a Smurf.
We could... We could just get frozen yogurt.
It's not a big deal.
Schmidt isn't about no frozen yogurt.
I want to go score some cr*ck cocaine.
Really?
We're gonna do this.
Look at them. This is a cabin, guys.
Getting wasted on a couple of sh*ts of absinthe.
Word games, word games, word games, word games, word games.
Doctor! I was saying...
I don't think I feel it.
I can't believe I'm the sober one.
That's actually never happened in my life.
Who wants to play Charades?
Me.
One syllable, one syllable.
Movie.
Gattaca.
Oh, I want to be them.
I have to run upstairs for a sec.
I have it on good authority my bed has disappeared.
I need to go check it out.
I got to head up there and take care of that.
Oh, you-you're gonna go upstairs?
Yeah, yeah.
Now?
Yeah.
Oh, ho-ho-ho, yeah.
Okay.
Have fun.
I will, I guess.
Up.
Doesn't sound good.
Oh, Jess.
That sounded terrible.
The absinthe has found a new host.
The toilet.
Oh...
I like Angie.
She's cool. It's kind of like riding a poorly maintained carnival ride.
I'm glad you get it.
I think she really likes you.
All right.
Jeth... I'm not... I'm-I'm with Jeth.
Hey, Nick, look, we switched.
And look... middle of the night...
What is the big deal?
I... why else did we all go to a cabin together?
To hike?
Guys, I'm still really feeling it.
I just can't believe you'd do that to Nick.
She didn't do anything to me.
We have an open relationship.
She can do whatever she wants. I don't care.
Enough. I'm tired of you acting like this cool guy with an "open relationship."
That is not you.
Yes, it is, Jess.
Why won't you just let me be me? This is me!
I'm sorry. I just don't believe you.
You're not this guy.
No, no, no, I'm not feeling good...
At least we don't pretend to be this perfect couple.
I do not pretend to be a perfect couple.
The only reason that we're here is 'cause you asked us to come,
'cause you didn't want to be alone with Dr. Sam.
'Cause then you'd have to be real with him.
Jess? Is that true?
Yes, but no... it's out of context.
It's out of context, Nick.
You think you know everything about me.
I'm a rock and roll guy.
You are the guy who asks me to light matches for you
'cause you're afraid your fingers are gonna get too hot.
I did that one time.
Multiple times.
I was on the back of a motorcycle earlier, and I wasn't even that scared.
You don't think I'm crazy?
No.
Would a sane man do this?
Oh!
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're doing it. You're doing a lot of it.
You need to just pace it a little bit...
Oh, whoa, that...
you're really doing it.
Whoa!
Well?
I suppose we could just get out and ask any of these street youths.
I'll let you get out the car first.
Go ahead, do your thing, man.
I don't want to ask the wrong person and end up with some sub-par cr*ck.
I want the fresh cr*ck, you know?
Not some cr*ck that's been laying around all day.
Ooh... I'm really starting to schvitz.
We don't have to do this. Man, we could just turn this car around, forget this ever happened, and get you some frozen yogurt.
I will not let you deny who you are any longer.
Not on my watch.
Schmidt...
Hey, psst!
Schmidt, no.
Yes. Skee-you!
Skee-you!
Schmidt!
You, dude.
Don't call that man to this car.
Hi, how are you this evening?
What do you guys need?
It's cool, just get in the car, man.
What cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
Schmidt, you did not invite this guy in this car.
He could be crazy, could have a g*n.
That's a r*cist thing to say, Winston, that he...
Stop it, Schmidt...
Just assuming that this man has a p*stol.
Hi, sir.
How are you this evening?
Um, the two of us are very interested in purchasing some cr*ck cocaine.
You guys cops?
What?
Okay, let me out.
Schmidt, Schmidt... I was just messing with you, man.
Okay? I was just trying to see how far your stupid white guilt would take you.
Have you ever done cr*ck?
Hell, no, I've never done cr*ck, man.
Why do you think I've done cr*ck? Because I'm black?
I thought you'd done cr*ck
'cause you told me the whole story about you doing cr*ck.
I though you guys just needed directions, okay?
Let me out!
Okay, sir, just calm down, all right?
Oh, please, man.
Be cool.- Fine, okay, look, you want it? You want it? Look!
Whoa! No!
Oh my God, no!
Look, my wallet.
No! No!
Take my wallet! Here's my wallet, okay?
sh**t the white dude! Just let me out...
sh**t him! No, don't sh**t me!
sh**t him, man! But that's...
That's your wallet.
That's your wallet.
Are you not robbing us?
You're not robbing me?
I don't want to rob you, man.
I thought you were gonna...
I totally misread the situation.
I thought you was robbing me.
Oh, no, man.
Oh, hey, man, I'm Schmidt.
Robert, man.
Robert. Nice to meet you.
Pleasure, man.
Robert, man, hey, man, nice to meet you, man.
What a nice smile he has. All right, guys.
I'm just...
Okay. Here, I'll... they're the child locks.
I don't even have kids, but...
You guys have a great night, okay?
You, too, man. Be safe.
Take care, Robert.
Take it easy, man. - You guys have a good night, man, all right.
That was insane.
I was terrified. That...
Oh, my goodness.
I judged...
God, Robert!
Robert...
I just... the wallet?
Oh, your wallet...
Oh, your wallet.
Just give him the wallet.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, it's kind of...
No, yeah, I get it.
I'd want my wallet back, too.
Thank you.
All right. Thanks, Robert.
I wouldn't thank him.
Whoa, man.
What a hilarious misunderstanding.
Schmidt, drive the damn car.
No, you're right.
You know, I feel so much better after throwing up into the f*re.
Uh, Sam, can you pass the bread?
Oh, sure thing.
No, I'll pass the bread, Angie.
Just keep your hands to yourself and let the bread come to you.
Why do you keep taking my bread?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you and the bread had an open relationship.
I said I was sorry. I thought this was an agreement.
I thought we were all cool with this. I don't...
Absinthe!
Fun dinner. Fun dinner.
I always have fun at the cabin.
You guys want to pick my brain?
You guys want to know what I'm thinking about?
I like dogs more than cats.
I like chipmunks more than squirrels.
I believe in UFOs.
I once had a bass teacher, when I was younger, who did the standing bass.
And he had a very weird smell, and I still think about it.
His name was Mr. Hilton.
I don't like the fact that you tried to kiss Sam.
Because I have feelings for you, Angie.
I'm... I had no idea, I'm sorry.
I know. We said it was open, but...
I'm proud of you for saying that.
Dr. Sam?
If you were a hat, you'd be a top hat.
But like a really big Monopoly one.
And I say that of the deepest compliments.
Appreciate it.
Winston, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.
What, help me realize that I'm black?
Schmidt, believe it or not, man, I've known that for a while now.
I just feel bad you're forced to live here with Jess and Nick.
Oh, wow.
I mean, they're h*nky as hell.
And look at our people. Look what we've given to this country.
Jazz...
The management of jazz musicians.
But, look, Schmidt, being black means whatever I want it to mean.
You know, the fact of the matter is I live in a loft with three people who happen to be white.
But believe you me, there is so much more that I find annoying about you that I haven't even gotten to race.
Now, I'm gonna get some frozen yogurt.
Would you like anything?
Yeah.
I'll have a vanilla chocolate swirl.
No.
What, no...
No. I'll have strawberry with jimmies.
Did you get that?
Hey.
How you doing?
Much better.
That alcohol got on top of me.
Oh... I'm a little embarrassed by that.
I'm sorry about Sam.
I... I thought it was cool.
Right. - And I try to ruin things as soon as they get good.
I'm working on it.
Believe it or not, I'm working on stuff, too.
You know, I just wish I was working on less stuff.
You know, I've been arrested three times.
Four times.
Four to five times.
I have tattoos of bands that I don't even like anymore.
By the way, you've been really cool about the "Jamiroquai"
tattoo on my butt.
I'm not asking you to change.
Just how about meet me in the middle a little bit?
What do you want me to do? Go to brunch?
Are we supposed to, like, read articles and then talk about them together?
Okay, I'm never going to be that kind of girl.
I just want to do something normal.
How about not drawing pubes on my armpit while I'm sleeping?
You think you could do something like that?
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause I would really like to keep this going.
Want to move your twin bed over here?
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Bird! Bird! Bird!
Bird!
Oh.
Help! Help!
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
No big, I got it! I'm on it.
Just a... it was a painting.
That's not really how I wanted the weekend to go.
I thought the worst thing that could happen was someone wouldn't like the cheese I brought.
I wanted it to be perfect.
Jess, when Nick said that you invited them because you were nervous...
No, don't worry about that.
Jess, we're not perfect.
Like the first time we slept together, like, I didn't even know your real name.
Kind of a pretty sassy detail.
Can we just concentrate on the fact that, like, I was tripping pretty hard on absinthe and I said, "No"?
To a stripper?
I mean, a stripper was like rubbing my leg...
That's weirdly...
the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
Got it.
I left a Post-it note on the transformer that said "Broken."
Is there any way that we could make it look like it was raccoon bites?
A few announcements.
Uh...
Angie left. Me.
What?
She took the motorcycle, and, uh, a few of my belongings, but I'm still wearing my underwear, so she comes up short-handed in that treasure hunt.
Seriously?
Oh, I'm so sorry, Nick.
I'm sorry, man.
It's fine; I'm a grown man.
I will need a ride home.
Yeah.
Obviously.
I would love to pitch in with gas, but I don't have any money, so I could pay in "Nick Bucks,"
fully redeemable for smiles and any one item from my bureau.
We'll hold you to that.
Thank you, Doctor.
Don't, I-I'm good.
I know you don't want to be hugged.
I don't want to be hugged.
And I respect that. So...
Okay. 'Cause I'm fine.
Jess, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I promise you, I'm good. Just...
Actually, this is very weird for me.
I'm not hugging you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I promise you I'm okay.
Stop making this a thing, because I'm not sad.
This is for the best.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
She didn't deserve you.
Whatever that means.
Thank you.
Okay, almost there.
Hey, let's go!
All right.
Hey, the potato salad's accidentally in the garbage.
Look at that.
You guys mind if I eat this in the back seat?
You can eat salad in my back seat anytime.
Didn't mean that to be sexual.
All right, guys.
It's a little bit gamey.
Okay.
I'll get the garbage, here.
Hold on, hold on.
The absinthe.
You almost screwed that up by accident.
Wow.
We're ready. You all right?
Yep, I'll be right with you guys.
That was a mistake! Whoo!
I am gonna poop weird tonight!
Yeah... Oooh, that was a mistake.
==special thanks to err0001==
You know, maybe I found out too early.
I was five years old when "Santa" gave me my own f*re truck and a teddy bear that smelled like my dad's cigarettes.
That's not Santa.
I just believe things and go on believing them.
If someone tells me a fat man's bringing me dolls every year, I just don't question it.
You would've been my nightmare.
We were on very strict instructions from Rabbi Schmulie not to say a word until the last Christian kid found out about Santa Claus.
Ruining Christmas, very bad for our brand.
Well, whether or not Santa's real, it's just nice to have something to believe in.
Did you just say
"Whether or not Santa's real"?
You don't believe in Santa Claus, do you? - No.
Do I wish Santa was real?
I mean, yeah.
Santa's not real, Winston.
Shut up, stupid! You're a dummy!
So... and... I don't even c...
Like, you're the... Okay, aw, here we go.
You know what, look who's talking. You're the same guy who only eats mayonnaise on game days.
That's how you makee the Chicago Bears win.
Hey, Winnie, were you a good boy this year?
Oh, really?
Stop, guys, stop!
Don't throw the cranberries!
Get him!
Stop!
I don't mess around!
No!
Truce! Truce! Truce!
Go for the eyes!
Truce! Truce!
One got stuck in my ear.
We got a cranberry in his ear.
How is that even possible?
Why don't you ask Santa Claus to take the cranberry out of your ear?
Huh?!
I said it got stuck in my ear!
Truce! Truce! Truce! Truce!

♪ It's Jess.
These pieces don't make a full berry.
There's definitely something still stuck in there.
Hey, would anybody mind giving me a ride to the airport tomorrow?
Full disclosure:
It's out of San Diego at 3:00 a.m.
So tonight's our last chance for a holiday hang-together?
A group hang on the Saturday before Christmas?
No, sorry, I can't tonight, Jess. Office party.
There are literally millions of parties. It's a puzzle as...
That's what you guys are talking about, right?
I mean, it's not like I can hear anything, because I got a cranberry stuck in my ear!
You're yelling.
Huh?
Slade and Sienna are having a house thing.
Oshiro-San is serving whale meat after midnight.
Huh? What y'all talking about?
Shut up.
Sadie is having a cookie-decorating party.
The gorilla twins are having a thump-thump.
Let's try to h*t all the parties we can.
Otherwise, I'm just gonna stay home and try not to call Sam.
What'd you say?
I'm gonna die alone.
And merry Christmas.
We have to hang out together.
I hate that idea.
I'll be designated driver.
I'm in.
Okay, yeah, let's do it.
The only we make this work is if we do the Irish good-bye.
We leave the parties without saying good-bye.
And I'm asking you guys as my friends to not be so damn awkward around my stripper girlfriend, just 'cause she's a stripper.
You are the most awkward.
You should probably stop calling her your "stripper girlfriend."
She's unpredictable and exciting, and I love that!
Ol' Nick Miller lives on the edge now. Vroom! Vroom!
And plus, we haven't had sex yet, and we might tonight.
I understood that!
Oh, yeah!
What'd you say, though?
♪ On the first day of Christmas ♪
♪ My true love gave to me a partridge... ♪
Merry Christmas!
Am I talking too loud?
Schmidt?
What?
A word?
What?
You haven't said one word to Cece since she got in the car.
I cannot believe that you invited her.
She's my best friend.
Hey, can I talk to you a little later?
Oh, were you hoping that I still had some soul left for you to crush?
I'm glad we're gonna be mature about this.
Whoa, what happened there?
Nothing. He told her that he loved her...
Okay, I just want to spend the night making it with some fatty in an elf costume.
Is that too much to ask for?
Instead I'm stuck here at this Lesbian cookie party.
It's all wreaths, no trees.
All right, Jess, you're on the clock;
You have five minutes in this party black hole.
Your friends are cool.
Yeah, no, no, I like them.
Yeah, they...
I live with them.
But being serious, it's been really fun.
I'm glad we're hanging out and spending time together and all that good stuff.
You know, to be completely honest, when I first met you, I didn't think that you could handle this.
Handle what? The fact that you're a stripper?
Me being... Yeah.
Are you kidding?
Me?
Yeah.
Is it good? You're sweating a little bit.
You know what, lady, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.
I've had tetanus thrice in my life.
Ew. - And look at what a badass cookie I made.
That's the kind of cookie Nick Miller makes.
Fine, look at my cookie.
What?
Yeah, but there are people here.
Are you not into having sex around people?
Who are you talking to?
Yeah? - I'm so open with sex, it's ridiculous.
You could at least take your coat off.
Oh, but I can't.
Pastel walls give me the chills.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, my God!
What?
What...
It's Sam! It's Sam! Put your coats on.
We're leaving.
Sam Sam? Where?
Yes, he's right over there.
He's talking to a woman whose sexuality I won't jump to conclusions about.
What a situation, huh, Jess?
Forced to spend time with someone who ruthlessly rejected you after you told him how much you cared about him.
Maybe...
Damn, he looks good.
Just wants everyone to get along.
Okay, if he wanted everybody to get along...
I'm seriously freaking out right now.
...then he wouldn't have acted like such a callous lady jerk.
Lady jerk?
Lady jerk.
I'm seriously freaking out right now.
Duck! He's gonna see you.
Ow. We have to get out of here, you guys. Where is everybody?
Yeah, man, see, when a cranberry gets lodged in the ear, it hurts. Look.
Psst, Winston.
Hey!
Do you guys know Sam's here?
Jess? - We're Irish good-bye-ing. Go! Go!
Go?
Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
All right, Schmidt, what's the address?
Get ready, last year
this party had acrobats
and caged snow leopards.
What?!
We're all here together. No drama.
Not bad, Schmidt.
Thank you.
Are they just gonna play computer music all night?
What are you talking about? That's a really respected deejay, who was also an actor on Boy Meets World.
Hey, Jess. Whoa, Sam.
What?!
No!
Why is this happening? No.
Please, I need to talk... Oh, God.
No. Oh, my...
Oh, I feel like a bird.
Aw, that's just sad.
How are you here?
Winston told me where the party was in exchange for an ear exam.
Winston told you what?!
What?
Jess, listen to me.
I want you back, Jess.
Oh.
Oh!
Are none of these doors?
Oh!
What, he just wants a relationship now, out of the blue?
You never just dreamed about him crawling back to you?
Anybody who's ever been dumped has dreamed about that special someone crawling their way back to them.
I mean, come on, right? It's the dump fantasy.
Let's workshop that term.
Of course I have.
We meet in a hospital, during wartime.
You can forgive a lot during wartime.
That is a fantasy, Jess.
Okay, people don't change.
They just think that they do.
He's a player. Think about it.
Why would a good-looking person ever become a doctor?
Jess?
Oh, my God! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go.
Door...
Jess?
Jess, uh, I don't know if you're in here.
I just wanted to tell you that...
I messed up.
You know, I-I went to that party to see you.
I knew you were gonna be there, 'cause I saw the comments on the Evite.
"Amazeballs, can't wait."
If you are here, I'm sorry if this sounds a little rehearsed.
This is the third room I've done this in.
Hey, what's he saying?
I want to hear...
Shut up, Winston.
Jess?
Jess?
Yep.
No.
You just think you can come back and I'm just gonna be waiting for you?
No, of course not. I mean...
I had to at least try.
You're too late.
I'm in love.
What?
With Winston.
What?
We've lain together.
No, yeah, I don't know how it happened.
It just got stuck up there so far, so quickly.
The relationship.
You know, sometimes when we're hanging out, it can get a little rough.
Oh, boy, does it.
Yeah.
All right. Well, I didn't know that, so...
What's going on? I feel like I'm missing something.
Snow time.
Hey, what are you doing? No, no, no.
Hey, everything is so expensive here, Angie.
Don't. Get off that thing.
Why don't you get on?
You know what?
Get in the sleigh, girl.
What happens in the sleigh?
What happens in the sleigh is I'll be your reindeer...
Uh-huh.
And take your toys up in the sky.
Sexy.
Ooh! Ho ho ho!
Here comes the chubby Santa boy!
Get in here.

We are... This is...

Oh, no!
No! This isn't...
This is my nightmare!
Merry Christmas!
Oh.
Hey. I know... I know you're trying to avoid me, but just take this gift I got you and I will walk away.
I don't celebrate Christmas, okay? Or as I like to call it, White Anglo-Saxon Winter Privilege Night.
I really want us to be friends.
Whenever you're ready.
Because I really do care about you.
Thank you so much for this.
'Cause this makes it so much better.
Here. This is for you.
What if you came home with me tonight?
You look like a hot elf.
Hold still.
Uh-huh.
Got it.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, man.
Now that I think about it, I mean, I'm not really surprised by you and... you know.
I mean, three guy roommates.
If I really am being honest with you, you were the only one that I was really thr*at by.
I mean, you got Metrosexual Jones and Sweatshirt Guy over there.
What are we talking about here?
Yeah, I would trade places with you in a heartbeat.
You know, except for the mustache.
Can I ask you something? How did you get her?
Oh...
Hmm.
Jess.
Yes. Yes, my love.
Honey, we both know we have been unhappy for far too long.
I am not just a vehicle you get to ride to Pleasure Town.
Be gone, h*nky!
This is for your own good.
Say good-bye to paradise, honey!
We were never going out.
Yeah, I got that.
I mean, Sam, what am I supposed to think?
So what? I'm just supposed to believe you when all of a sudden you come back to me, and you tell me you want to make it work?
I-I want to believe you, but I just feel so...
No!
No! Why do you think you can just kiss me?
I thought that was the right...
That's all this ever was to you.
That's not true, Jess.
No.
No. I'm always so gullible, and I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm done.
Oh, I mean, I get it.
I'm... I'm too late. I messed up.
Yeah, you did. You messed up.
Well, I'll leave you alone. Merry Christmas.
No!
I'm leaving you alone.
I know... I know you do this kind of thing all the time, but believe it or not, I don't.
What? What does that mean?
Look, I know for you, this kind of stuff is normal.
Oh.
Doing it in sleds.
And...
Oh, this is because I'm a stripper.
Yeah.
Are you laughing at me?
No.
I'm laughing into me.
Maybe you just can't handle this.
No. It's great.
You're a stripper for now. I'm a bartender for now.
For now?
We're not gonna be that for...
Okay, well, for now, I'm just gonna walk away.
For now, you can kiss my ass.

Ooh, hey. - Want to pitch on the new Double V campaign?
I'm all about the Double V ... what is that?
It's a new vodka, yeah.
Filled with vitamins ... Double V?
What do you think?
You know, I've never been considered to run an account before.
Wait a min... Wait, is this just is this because we used to... bingity-bangity?
No, of course not.
Take a look at the specs and come into my office tomorrow in your best suit, and, uh, blow me away with your take.
My best suit ... I can put on my best suit.
Okay.
Wasted project, Nick, huh?
Herringbone?!
How did you get in here?
To schmidt.
Sleeping his way to the top.
Cheers to me.
I hope you like it.
I poured that one for you.
Drink it up.
This is coming off weird ... it's creepy, right?
Go get her.
I can't do that.
I can't talk to thirsty.
Thirsty?
I don't know her name, so I call her Thirsty.
Thirsty Mendelson.
Oh, you made her Jewish?
I didn't make her Jewish.
Mendelson? She's not Jewish?
Well, Thirsty. - If her last name's Mendelson, she's Jewish.
Tell you what her first name is, too ... It's Rachel.
Get out of my head ... you're kind of ruining my thing right now.
What I have with thirsty is perfect.
She's surly like I'm surly, and she rolls her eyes at everybody like I roll my eyes at everybody.
She likes to drink in the afternoon.
And I like to drink in the afternoon.
Go talk to her.
No, I can't.
That breaks the first rule of bartending ... never cross the bar.
'Cause once you cross the bar, it gets messy.
Rudy just wants her $200 back.
Come on, neither of you has the right bra for this.
Excuse me, have you seen Rhonda?
Have you seen the ferret lady?
Why am I doing this?!
Never cross the bar.
Your rules have gotten you so far.
Classic Nick Miller.
You got it.
Jess.
You want to help me at the jukebox really quick?
Oh, my God, yes ... I've always wanted to do this with you.
Well, I was gonna go
"Raspberry Beret," but...
If we're gonna go Prince, I think we should go, like ...
Jess, I want to talk to you about your bathtub pitch.
I love baths ... I do.
Back in Latvia, we had a great tub.
But I tell you what ... there are parts of my butt only a tub can clean.
Ew, but okay!
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, so the guys don't know.
We're gonna split the 400 bucks for the tub.
Then we can hide it on the roof and install it in the middle of the night, and then we can just pretend like you did it without our permission.
Or we could just...
say that you wanted a tub, too.
How about we just keep this a Jess and Winston thing?
Hey, Cece, you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good;
Just broke up with Robby.
I'll make you a drink.
What ha... what happened?
Um, I told him I had to start getting serious about having kids and he said,
"Okay, that's cool."
But then that's all he said for the next eight hours, and he hasn't said anything to me since.
So terrible.
I just, I can't even...
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
I mean that's... but I mean...
There's... cool. It's cool.
'Cause you're single. You're single.
Really subtle stuff.
She's single now; technically, you're single... are you not single? - Schmidt!
I have to get serious about my future, otherwise my mom is going to set me up with a hundred sweet, gentle, painfully boring Indian guys.
Oh, my God, your mother.
I want to control your life.
That's how my parents met and they had a beautiful, healthy marriage.
I respect your parents ... I do.
I respect everything that ... look what they've created.
Look at that... look at your beauty, with your hair.
I'd eat it out of a bowl, your hair.
I'd put it in a bowl and I'd eat your hair.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Cece.
I-I know it's unexpected that I'm here.
It's because I wanted to tell you something.
You're my boo.
You're my boo and I'm... and I'm...
I been missing you.
I been missing you oh, so long.
You know what's weird? I don't find this weird anymore.
What's your problem, Nick ... how long you been standing there?
How much of that did you hear?
I'm in love, man.
I'm in love with Cece.
Everyone knows that, you dumb-ass.
You always have been.
I gotta tell her, man.
You should do that, Schmidty, that sounds great.
Do I have your blessing?
Do you have my blessing?
Yeah. I don't think you need my blessing, big guy.
Just kind of do your thing. - I would like your blessing. You're my best friend.
I want your blessing. - Schmidt, fine, you got my blessing, okay? Just...
What is this?
Give me a hug. Give me a hug. I need this.
Come on, please, give me, give me a hug, Nick.
Please, just give me a hug! I want ... Ow!
Good stuff.
Thank you, Nick.
Come on!
All right, looks good ... no leaks.
We did it.
Yeah, we did.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
It's flooding!
Do something!
No, no, no, no, no!
I've never wished I was d*ad more.
Schmidt's gonna freak out.
He once told me he spent $300
on a pocket square.
No!
Am I overreacting?
Eh, that's about right.
There you go... good as new.
So, I've, uh, handled this one-man job, any two-man jobs you want us to tackle?
I think we're good. Thanks, Remy.
You sure there's not something else that needs fixing?
Maybe in the... lady's bedroom?
Uh, yeah, I think we're done ... thank you, Remy.
I will return your ladder when I feel like it.
Thank you, bye.
He's so weird.
Um, okay, so, phase two.
Didn't Schmidt make us get renter's insurance when he almost tore down that rafter with the sex swing?
Jess, we fake a robbery.
We fake a robbery for the insurance.
That's a great idea.
We're a couple of meth-heads.
Oh, yeah.
Boom.
Got any meth?
Got any rings on your fingers?
I need them for meth.
Get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all.
Whoa! Do we have to steal my moustache trimmer?
This is worth three bowls of sweet, sweet meth.
This? This?
No.
No. This?
I just don't think the meth-heads would want anything in this room.
What about this?
A land line?
To me, it looks like a meth sandwich.
Don't hog all the meth, daddy.
Did you h*t this already?
No, did you?
No.
What are you doing?
You're smothering me, all right?
I'm done with this!
At least leave your wallet!
I'm out of here!
Would you like a whiskey?
What?
I said that because I know you like whiskey.
You're a whiskey girl, like me.
You're a whiskey girl?
I'm Nick.
I'm Angie.
Angie... Angie, Angie.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Go grab a bottle and get me drunk, idiot.
Well, I-I couldn't drink with you ... I work here.
Just kidding, I get drunk, like, all the time.
I've got a drinking thing.
You got it.
I also have all the access to pistachios if you want, like, a full...
I'll make my own mind up on that.
He took my doctor's appointment suit!
He took El Capitan!
Damn it!
The only thing he left was my summer suit with the lightning bolt on the back.
I keep that in my summer bin along with my summer condoms ... citrus-flavored, for a more refreshing summer experience.
That's a jar...
Jar for sure, yeah.
Look at this ... took my suits.
Left the... left the douche bag jar.
Typical meth-head.
Typical meth-head.
Yeah, it's a shame.
Good thing that I have a security camera in there.
I'm gonna download the footage and I.D. this S.O.B.
He's going down.
I respect the amount you drink ...
Oh, FYI these drinks aren't free.
Wow, well, joke's on you 'cause Mike left with all my money.
Oh, really!
Then how you gonna pay for the drinks?
Oh... probably with sex?
Sorry...
That is not pretty.
Well...
I was gonna let you have sex with Mike.
Oh...
What? It's good.
That was an old switcheroo.
I just want to say you two, uh...
What?
No, no, I don't want to say.
Come on, what?
I don't want to say. I don't feel like it's ...
The point is it's not my...
What are you afraid of?
You're thinking it. - I'm not afraid, but... He's kind of an ass ... damn it!
You think I should break up with Mike?
No, no, that is not my place to...
Well, you did; it is your place.
But I've been drinking with you, and I feel like you're luring me in... Dump his ass!
Damn it.
I can't believe you'd say that to me.
You should mind your own business.
So many years of footage.
This is from last May.
I was trying to add an extra ab muscle.
Jess, I can't take this...
This is when I was experimenting with faux hawks.
I can't, I can't, I can't take it, Jess.
You can.
You're gonna blow this.
My face is numb.
This is when I was lowering my bar sexually.
Why is my face numb?
Okay, I'm gonna say this once.
Tighten up.
Okay, yeah.
I can't believe this is happening.
It's such an important day.
What's happening today?
I just have to look good.
Okay? Not like some Ukrainian dentist.
Oh, my God.
Jess, I'm dying.
What's wrong with you.
I'm dying, Jess.
Jess, pretend you're not seeing this...
Schmidt, this isn't a good time.
Cece, please.
Just... just open the box.
You brought a pigeon into my house?
I couldn't find a dove. Come on, Beatty.
It's... it was supposed to fly out when you opened up the lid.
What are you doing?
I love you, Cece.
And I have been in love with you for so long.
I used to think it was just a heavy like, but...
it's love.
There it goes.
Is this real?
For you?
Yes.
Cece, I'm ready for a serious commitment.
I'm up for a huge promotion at work.
I'm ready to have kids with you, if that's what you want.
You want to have kids?
Let's go right now, let's go make a kid.
Take your top off.
Schmidt, my mother...
she's gonna hate you.
Okay? You're Jewish.
She hates Jews; I mean, she really hates them.
Everybody hates the Jews.
Your mom's in the majority.
I'll convert to Indianism.
Hindi... Hindi-is...eh?
Indiani-Indi... Indi-Buddhi-ism?
Schmidt, we have so much going against us.
Let's have dinner. Tonight.
Okay.
Cool. No, yeah, cool.
Just give me a second.
Ah... yes!
I'm sorry.
Wiston, are you out of your head?
Security camera.
What are you doing? Schmidt has a security camera.
Why did I think he didn't have a security camera?
Oh. You're a briefs man.
I was hoping I'd never find out.
Oh, my goodness, we should not have gone for that tub.
I just like bubbles so much...
Winston, I think you're having a panic att*ck.
Hmm?
Shut up, hey, Jess, no.
I'm, uh... this is just the willies.
The w... the what? The... the willies?
The willies, yeah. It's the same thing that happened when I took my driver's test.
Go ahead and start the car.
No! No!
A lot of people get panic att*cks.
The willies.
My dad used to get them all the time.
Like, every time he had to make a left turn.
It would take him two and a half hours to drive me to school.
We'd just drive all around Portland, making right turns.
Okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
It's really okay.
Are you going to tell anybody about my underwear?
Look, I really want to.
But I won't.
Where is he?
It's over, Mike.
Where's Nick?
Just stop... just stop it.
Hey. You Nick?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not Nick.
Nick has pinkeye! I'm Ricardo!
Let Nick go!
Ricardo? Ricardo? This is Nick, huh?
(Speaking fake Spanish)
You're a d*ad man!
I had it handled!
He was gonna k*ll you. I've seen him do it.
I know someone at work who can stitch him up. - Okay, let's get him stitched up right now. This is disgusting. - Okay.
I'm out there every night,
balling to the max, and you expect me to do what, just stop and chew up some cherry-flavored multi-V?
No, thanks.
I'll take my vitamins on the rocks. Double V.
Heart. Spirit. Body. Party.
You gotta get specific about this vodka.
Have you tried Double V?
No.
Let's open up this bitch.
Let's open up... okay.
Um... I kind of...
We're going to do every vitamin, in alphabetical order. Each sh*t that you do, makes me know you're going that extra mile.
Emma, I really... - Is there something more important than work?
What?
Okay.
But you said ...
No, I... no, no, no.
Let's-let's just... all right, we'll do it.
Don't feel weird, Winston.
Everybody has their weird thing.
Even me.
Look, I'm gonna tell you something about myself.
I am really claustrophobic.
Jess, I don't believe you.
No, seriously, watch.
You seem fine to me.
I seem fine, but if I close the door, it's gonna feel like I'm dying...
even more than a real death.
It just feels like death... plus more death.
Okay, this is silly. Just come on.
But I'm gonna be okay, because I know you're out there.
Mm-hmm.
And you can help me...
Oh, my God...
Okay...
Oh, my God. Let me out!
Jess, this is not... this is not funny, Jess.
Can you open up the door?
Jess?
It's closed!
Oh, my God, Jess, the door is stuck.
It's so hot in here!
Jess, the door is stuck!
Oh, my God! - Jess, come on, now, this is not funny.
Oh, my God... Oh, my God... Oh!
Jess, this is not... oh, my goodness, is it hot?
So you're not a nurse?
Who said I was a nurse?
Stitches ... you said somebody at work can do stitches.
Who does stitches at a strip club?
Someone need stitches?
Let me get my needle and my bifocals.
Be right back.
Okay, let's get you down right next to that dirty pole.
There? That? Okay, good.
Th... really nice place.
Uh, this is where you work.
You the ticket-taker?
No, I'm a stripper.
Yeah.
But what is it that you do here?
Stripper. - Because college is so expensive these days...
I'm a stripper.
But only topless.
Completely naked.
Mike, where's my taco?
What happened? What happened?
Uh, he remembered that he was married to you, so he tried to b*at the memory out of his brain with a brick.
Oh, he's married...
You stupid bitch!
Oh, not okay!
Ladies! Stop fighting!
Hey, hey! Stop this now!
Don't stop this! I'm super aroused!
I think I just became a dirt bag.
Why did I cross the bar?
I did it.
I'm here for dinner. I made it.
It's really late.
We got the account. I was with my boss, we got the account.
We did it.
You were with your boss?
What?
No. - The woman who made you sign a contract so she could have sex with you, your boss? - No.
No. Uh...
Yeah.
Yeah.
No... but nothing happened.
She just wanted me to taste the V.
That came out wrong.
Yeah.
I thought about...
I thought about the boss's boobs once.
They're still real nice, but I didn't have no connection to them emotionally, whatsoever.
Nothing.
Cece, I can pay for our baby's college now.
Literally anywhere they want to go.
UCLA, UMass... any of the U schools.
I love you so much.
You should probably...
Oh, not...
It's okay.
Cece, I'm gonna pee in my summer suit.
Hey, Mom, it's me.
I think I'm ready to have you set me up.
This is not a prank. Call me back.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, man.
I see.
If you guys have been playing hard to get, you don't have to.
I am totally ready to get mixed up in this choco-vanilla shake.
No.
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about here.
I'm just talking about...
Yes... I know, I know.
We got it, we got it, Remy.
...doing it with-with both of you.
We got it. Yeah.
Three...
This never happened.
Jess, I just want to say thank you.
You know, I thought I was the only crazy one, but it turns out you're nuts as well.
Oh, I'm straight-up bananas, Winston.
Next time that happens to you, just come to me, and I'll help you keep your pants on.
So what are we gonna do about Schmidt's suits?
I feel like there's a very obvious solution.
Oh, come on! Again?
Thank God. The meth-heads came back.
They brought your suits back
'cause they don't fit them.
They did the right thing,
'cause they're drug addicts, they're not monsters.
Right.
They actually got them dry-cleaned, um...
deluxe package, very pricey.
Why'd he tie you up?
They kept saying, like,
"Ah, I'm so hungry for more meth," you know?
"Let's get rid of these suits.
These clean... suits."
Jess and I want a tub.
We want candles and bubbles.
Oh, damn it, Schmidt, we want bubbles, man.
I want to cover everything up on my body with bubbles.
You know, and then just blow 'em off like this...
and laugh, like...
Get a tub, man. Let's get a tub; I don't care.
Hey.
You okay?
What's wrong?
I told Cece that I loved her.
Then I got drunk, and she called her mom, and...
She's going brown.
She wants to marry a brown man.
Schmidt...
Schmidt!
Hey, man.
Hey...
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold it right there.
Let it go, man.
Let it go.
Okay.
How'd you guys get out of your ties?
Hey...
Hey.
What can I get you to drink, Angie?
Oh, no, I don't...
I just want to... hang out.
I've got this rule.
Never cross the bar.
And I broke that rule, and...
Look, these 18 inches of oak are the only thing that separates me from guys like Sid over there.
No disrespect. I got your next round.
Well, I don't have any rules.
Don't do... don't...
No customers...behind the bar.
Oh, Sid, you gotta... You're k*lling me.
Sit down and drink your beer.
I'm a man with feelings.
Feelings that are bubbling up inside of me, and...they're about to explode.
I'd like for those feelings to explode on you.
You got this, dawg. Look at you, dawg.
Look at you!
Look at your face, dawg!
Look at your face!
You got this, son!
♪ Well, I love you ♪
♪ And I've never said those words ♪
♪ Well, I love you, from the bo... ♪
To my dear friends, Melissa and Sadie.
Aw.
Five years together.
That is awesome.
Hear, hear.
What is your secret?
I don't really think there is a secret. I think it's just about...
love, understanding, and...
two sets of boobs.
I love boobs. I love 'em.
I love... - Okay
...everything about 'em. - Yeah, I do, too.
All different kinds.
Yeah, that's my thing too.
I love them.
And the Curiosity Rover has touched down on the planet of Mars.
What's happening right now?
What's happening in there?
Schmidt's in there with his boss.
He's entertaining her.
Ew.
I don't care what he does.
I just don't understand why he has to narrate it!
Robot arm engaged!
It's just engaged now?
So he's saying everything up to this point has been foreplay?
Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous.
What are you gonna do for 20 minutes of foreplay?
Boring! Yawn!
Am I right, ladies?
So, I actually know what's about to happen next.
You will all want to cover your ears.
I found water!
No, I didn't do it in time.
Oh, he found...
Has anybody seen a movie in the last five months, and can you describe the plot in great detail and loudly?
Okay, you're dry.
Actually, I'm good. Thank you.
Come on. I spent six dollars on this wine.
I've been looking for the right time to tell you tonight, but Melissa and I are so excited because... Wow.
That is so upsetting.
What mission is this based on?!
I'm pregnant! We are pregnant!
Wha...?
Lesbian baby. Congratulations, you guys.

I feel so lucky, you know?
Like I really tucked this one in just under the wire.
What do you mean? You're so young.
As your friendly neighborhood gynecologist, you should know that by the time a lady hits 30, she loses about
90% of her eggs.
What? No, th-that can't be true.
What?
Did you know that there's a test that you can take that tells you how many beans you got left in your bean sack?
Ovaries.
It estimates basically how many childbearing years you have left.
Yeah, get this baloney:
I'm 32, but my eggs are 48, and my vag*na is 97.
I am so uncomfortable.
But it gets better with age ... it's like the vag*na Helen Mirren.
Oh, boy.
I've got big plans for the centennial.
When can I take that test?
Who cares?
Personally, I'm still on the please-God-I-hope-
I'm-not-pregnant phase.
What am I doing here?
You know, just clinically speaking, it's probably a good idea to know.
I want to take this test! Like, now.
Can we take this test right now?
Morning, ladies.
And Nick.
Morning?
Well, I mean, I work nights now, so I'm on an adjusted sleeping schedule.
I just woke up, here's my breakfast, I'm going to work.
Take me with you! They're talking about vaginas!
I hate it! Take me with you!
Our bodies really made something.
I feel like we brought manufacturing jobs back to America.
Yeah, it was fine.
What do you mean "fine"?
I broke your brain, girl.
How do I put this delicately?
I was...
nowhere close to finishing.
I was bored.
And cold.
That's cool. Uh...
No, yeah.
World shattered.
We'll try again. It'll be better.
The world I once lived in... shattered.
All right, see you at work.
See you at work.
Put me on the air.
I got something to say
about Andrew Bynum's hair.
All right, caller, you're up next.
Look at you, man. This is great.
You're the king of your own castle.
Look at this. What is this?
Why do you need so many pens, you big sh*t?
I like what I do, man. I finally feel like my life is moving in the right direction.
That is what I don't have in my life.
But not anymore.
I'm gonna take one of these pens, I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write my zombie novel.
You don't think I can do it, do you?
You know, it's not that. It's just that sometimes I get the feeling that you...
don't want to write.
No more excuses. I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write that novel.
And I'll be the first to read it.
We got a deal, friend.
Deal.
Yeah, you still have me on the line.
My two cents? He's never gonna write that book.
Why don't you shut up, Manny from Cerritos?- Okay.
Who asked you? Hang up the phone.- All right.
We should go.
Melissa's been drinking for two.
Three.
Awesome night, ladies.
Educational. Thank you.
Sorry. I'm just...
Okay. I'm sorry.
What?
Sadie, before you leave, can I just ask you a few questions?
I know where this is going.
You are a gynecologist
and a lesbian, which makes you...
well, a va-genius.
Jar.
I know my way around a Grizzly Adams.
You, too? Jar.
Wh...
As an adult male, I would like to ask you a few questions about, you know, the downstairs girl cookie.
Jars, jars, all around jars!
This is my personal time right now.
You can make an appointment at my office, pay your $40 co-pay.
I will be happy to answer your questions.
Yes! I'm in. Please.
Now, would I have to put my legs up in the stirrups?
Why would you?
I'm asking more so out of curiosity than fear. #excitement.
Are you done?
I'm done. I'll see you, okay?
I'm gonna call the office.
Okay.
Well, thank you, guys, for the...
awesome drunky thing and the weirdly sobering end.
Look, I know Sadie freaked you out with all this talk about tests, but I just want to remind you that at the end of the day, it's all about love.
I mean, I love Sadie.
I want my babies to have her beautiful face.
As long as they don't get her big, fat man-feet.
Yuck. Fingers crossed we go donor on that one.
Okay.
Let's make a graceful exit, my love.
Okay.
Hey, get out of here, you crazy lesbos, with your baby-making!
Ooh!
Whoo!
Ah! I'm married;
I'm not d*ad!
See you. Night.
Drive safely.
90% of our eggs, huh?
That's crazy. I'm panicking.
You panicking?
God, no. Babies wreck you, Jess.
They literally eat your body.
I'm 30, I'm single, and I just started a new job.
Tonight I used a bread roll to wipe butter off my face, and then I ate the bread roll, so I essentially used my face as a butter Kn*fe.
I don't think I'm ready to bring new life into the world, but...
what if all that's left are the weird eggs?
And the evil eggs?
You have no evil eggs.
I can feel them. They're turning.
They watched their brothers and sisters die, and now they want to be birthed.
I need to be fertilized.
Fertilize me, Los Angeles!
Calm down, all right?
You're overreacting.
I am overreacting! You know why?
Because I want a family.
I want to give my nipples a purpose.
Give my nipples a purpose!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, God, that was a mistake.
Duck down. That was a mistake.
We're taking that test.
Well I think that you guys made a really smart decision coming in here today.
Sadie, once at a senior graduation party, I sat in a very hot Jacuzzi for... 12 hours.
Is there any chance that I sunny-side upped my eggs?
No, Jess.
Oh, between the years of 1998 and 2005, I used a lot of self-tanner.
Like, a lot.
Is that a possibility of, um...
Do I... Okay.
Nope.
Here we go.
I once fell on a pommel horse...
I'm gonna call you when I get the results.
This is good.
I got nothing. This is...
Whoa, whoa, Jess, what are you doing?
That's my ketchup collection!
This fertility Web site says I need to get rid of anything with toxins.
Did you put the microwave in the trash?
Yes.
Why would you do that?
Microwaves zap things!
You can't take my microwave away!
Zap my insides!
It's the only thing I love!
I can't risk it!
It's what makes burritos delicious!
I don't care!
You care about your burritos more than my children, Nick?
You're putting me in a tough spot.
Friends, I'm in a real-life sex pickle.
My inability to satisfy Emma has thoroughly rocked me.
I've tried everything.
How about now?
Hold on. I'm Shazam-ing this song.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Guess what I'm worried about?
This sound.
You know what that sound is?
It's the sound of an empty uterus.
I don't need test results to tell me that it is The Grapes
of Wrath in there.
It is 1930s Dust Bowl in there, Schmidt.
And they're all walking with limps.
I can top that easily. I'm having a hard time with my zombie novel.
Oh, not this...
Are you literally comparing a zombie novel to my ability to create life?
I'm a writer, Jess. We create life.
Ugh! Being a woman sucks!
Preaching to the choir. Women are the worst.
Seriously, can you please stop yelling?
All right, now, it's no big deal, but I'm on an adjusted schedule.
Sorry about this. Jess has absolutely lost her mind.
I have not lost my mind!
Yeah, you have.
I'm just scared!
Would you trust me?
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna meet somebody and...
you're gonna fall in love and then...
before you know it, you're gonna...
With who, Nick?
Who's gonna... lay a flag down on this sweet, sweet continent?
I'll man up. But I must warn you, Jess ... I don't have sperms.
I have tadpoles.
Of the gods.
That's right.
And I'm gonna give 'em to you.
You can have 'em all, for all I care.
That's how much I love you.
I feel your pain in this situation.
I want you to have babies.
Take my sperms.
No. It should be me, Jess.
What?
With your big, beautiful blue eyes and my...Blair Underwood-like skin, Mm-hmm.
We'd have the most beautiful baby the world has ever seen. - He's not wrong.
It could get into any school it wants.
Mm-hmm.
To be clear, I haven't asked any of you to impregnate me.
I think it's important that that's been said.
Good, 'cause it's definitely not me.
Good, 'cause it's definitely not you.
I would love that little baby with all my heart.
Even if I did show it by picking him up from school in my underwear and...
hitting on the crossing guard.
How's the zombie novel coming? Good, good, good.
I haven't written a word.
Wait, are you serious?
Nick, it's not that hard, man.
Just sit down and write.
You ain't Hemingway.
You boys are right.
Mm-hmm.
I got to be more like Hemingway.
I just lost another one of my eggs while you were comparing yourself to the most famous writer of all time.
Maybe the reason I have writer's block is I've been living too casual with you clowns.
I need real-life adventure like Ernest Hemingway had at my age.
Man, I got to run with the bulls.
I got to k*ll a man with my bare hands after making sweet love to him and then sleep on the warm belly of his horse.
I got to eat my way out of a sandwich house!
How much you know about Hemingway?
Not a lot! But I'm gonna learn!
I'm becoming Ernest Hemingway.
You idiots.
Schmidt.
Yo.
Okay, Schmidt.
Female pleasure.
Here are some diagrams, so we can see where you're at.
The vag*na.
I'm familiar.
Good.
Now, what I typically do is I start over here, and then I move here once I feel confident that this area has been taken care of.
Yeah, see, that's exactly what I do.
I call that "Losing Nemo."
Well, a more advanced move would be...
You know what? I'll just show you.
It's sort of... Come in this way.
No, no, I see what you're doing. That asymmetry right there?
That's crucial.
'Cause then what I'll do is is I'll go outside, get the paper, and shake the neighbor's hand.
Interesting.
Then what I'll do is, I'll tie a bow on it because it's birthday time.
Then I get onstage and collect my Oscar and say thank you to the people, thank you to the people, then get back down offstage and get everybody into the sharing circle, right down there in the sharing circle, and then...
spike the volleyball.
Then what I like to do is, I like to arrive at the bridge, meet the troll, and then answer his riddles three.
Then what we do is, we're dancing.
We're just gonna dance, we're gonna dance for a while.
We'll dance until you can't dance anymore, dancing till you can't dance anymore, and then everybody gets a churro.
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
It's the baby hormones.
They are not as gay as me.
So I'm good at this, right?
Schmidt, in my professional opinion, you have definitely earned the rank of ...
and I will use the phrase you coined ... va-genius.
Thank you, thank you so much.
I really needed to hear that, Sadie.
You got to go.
Hey, Winston,
we're going on an adventure!
We need real-life experience like Hemingway.
Whoo, I feel like Hemingway.
This is life experience?
Yeah, the zoo is the best we can do, I told you, but it's got everything we need.
It's got life, animals, man, beast.
Look, I'm sorry, dude, it's just, you know, I'm not supposed to be awake right now because of my adjusted...
Adjusted schedule, yeah.
Hey, man, 13
minutes of sleep.
Honestly, Nick, seriously,
13 minutes of sleep ... that's all I got.
You're starting to look like a pillow to me.
All I can think of is, like,
"Man, Nick looks exactly like a pillow to me."
Hmm, what'd you say? Winston, you need some sleep.
But I'm out here with you.
Yeah.
Okay, because I love you.
Thank you.
And I want you to finish your zombie book.
Okay, but check out where we are.
This is experience, this is what's f*ring me up to get back to writing.
This is kind of what it's all about.
What are you doing?
It's writer's fuel.
That's what Hemingway said.
Sadie, um, hey.
Uh, I just, I just want you to know that I am, um, I'm like ...
I am okay with whatever you tell me.
I'm just like, if you say you've got a year, that's fine.
If you say, like, "You can have kids till you're 80,"
that's fine, too. If you say, "You are barren,"
um, I'm, I'm okay with that, too.
Um, just, why am I the only one talking?
Just lay it on me.
What's inside my body?
Everything looks good, Jess.
Your hormone levels are outstanding.
What?
Actually these are off the charts for someone your age.
I mean, I don't know how you're walking around with this many eggs.
♪ I'm the egg queen ♪
♪ I'm queen ♪
♪ of the eggs. ♪
Right.
Cece.
Mm-hmm.
You know what? Maybe we should talk in private.
Cece, Cece.
Cece, wait, do you want to talk?
Jess, you don't get it.
Sadie basically just told me that if I want to have a kid, I've got to start right now.
Right now.
I thought I had all of this time.
I didn't want to have to think about this.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I made you take the test.
What can I do?
Make me a guy so I don't have to worry about this.
You know what? Yes.
Yeah, let's be guys just for today.
Let's, let's care about stupid things, talk about sharks and sci-fi movies and making everything wireless.
"Dude, my phone is wireless, my computer is wireless.
Everything's wireless, yeah."
You're a terrible guy.
"Come on."
No, I'm the best guy.
Come on, come on.
All right.
Okay, how was that?
Eh.
Why, though, with the "eh"?
Unbelie ... but I played out your most secret fantasy:
French maid handyman does...
Studio 54...
Studio 54 busboy.
I know, it's disappointing.
I thought I k*lled it.
And I picked you at work because I heard you were amazing in bed.
I ... no, no, no, I am, okay, I know that I am.
I have it on good authority from my model ex-girlfriend and an actual lesbian gynecologist that I know exactly what I'm doing, so it's got to be you.
It's us ... this doesn't work.
When I got divorced I-I, I thought I could go out there and have all these new experiences ...
the contract of sex with someone at work who's so far beneath me, you know, someone basically just powerless.
I guess I have to feel something.
Okay, see, I'm not like that.
I don't even understand that concept.
My ex-girlfriend the model ... she's a model.
I know she's a model.
We'd have sex, and it was just like, I was happy, you know, I, I...
We were connected, I wasn't thinking about anything.
What is that?
That is love, you idiot.
That's love.
Yuck.
It sucks.
So, what, do I have to, I have to, like, be in love now to have good sex?
Think about me ... I got to go out in the world and meet people, date.
You're going to be great.
You think?
Yeah.
Consider our sex contract void.
How am I gonna get the feathers off?
I have no idea.
Jess and that girl!
Uh...
Oh, I'm so glad they're here.
So you're getting a lot of work done here, huh?
Who wins ... me versus gorilla? Go.
Gorilla.
Me versus gorilla.
Gorilla.
No, but in a contest.
Gorilla.
Yeah, but in a competition.
Uh, gorilla.
You don't get it.
Okay, are you just drunk at the zoo right now?
Let's go look at snakes.
Okay.
Where are the snakes?!
All day.
You know what?
I don't think we should act like the guys.
Jess, what am I going to do?
What am I going to tell Robby?
You are a Mexican West Coast rattlesnakes, and they call you "fang-tastic."
No one ever calls me anything like that.
Nick, what are you doing?
This is not life experience;
This is procrastination at the zoo.
I don't think it is.
Now, I need some sleep.
I got to work tonight.
Okay, congratulations, I'm glad you found your passion... - Okay, look...and that you love what you do.
Wow.
But enough's enough.
Don't throw it in my face.
Is it like that, is it like that, Nick?
Don't throw it in my face.
Nick, I got off my adjusted schedule...
Don't say "adjusted schedule."
That's super annoying.
Adjusted schedule.
Stop saying it.
Adjusted schedule.
You say it again, I'm gonna let the snakes out.
Adjusted schedule. Let the snakes out.
I will let...
These guys have done a pretty good job keeping it sealed. - Yeah, yeah.
Nick, you're not a finisher.
Oh, I'm a finisher.
You're not a finisher at all, man.
That's why you didn't finish law school.
Don't do that.
The same reason you're only three episodes into Downton Abbey.
There's just too many characters, it's hard to follow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, man, you're scared, and that's okay ... be scared.
Just stop wasting my time because I'm tired and I need to sleep because I want to work tonight at the job I'm passionate about.
I'm glad you called me;
I love the zoo.
You think I'm like a bear?
I mean, I kind of move like a bear, and I got that really long, sharp toenail that you love so much.
Hey.
Randa.
It says here you're 43.
Keeping it tight, girl.
What do you think of kids?
I love kids.
I would like to have children someday.
Someday?
Well, yeah, like in ten years or something.
Yeah.
I have a lot of eggs.
Unfortunately I don't have a lot of sausage.
Yeah, I shouldn't be complaining.
I'll be okay.
Hey, Winston.
Aah, what?
Sorry to wake you.
- Z is for Zombie.
What?
I finished my novel.
I stayed up for 14 straight hours.
I even peed in water bottles.
We have a bathroom.
Wow, you dedicated it to me.
"To Winston. Have a nice summer.
Hope to see you ag..."
Really?
I just want to say right now, the black guy dies early ...
his name is William ...
but don't take offense;
It's a staple of the genre.
I can't take this ... too much anxiety.
I'm going to my room.
Hey, Winston, are you reading it?
Hey.
Oh, hey.
I knew it.
I knew you'd choose me to get you pregnant.
Yep, let's go.
Jess.
Schmidt.
I think I may have been in love with Cece.
You are in love with Cece.
You think?
Can't believe I have to have feelings to have good sex.
I was hoping I'd be d*ad before this happened.
Hey, why are we all hanging out in my room and sitting on my bed?
Nick, this is the worst thing I have ever read in my entire life.
You misspelled the word "rhythm"
38 times.
- Z is for Zombie?
Yeah, Z Is for Zombie.
The zombie novel.
Yeah.
"Rhythm" is a tough word.
Don't feel bad about that.
Yeah, thanks, man.
Did you get to the word search?
Yeah.
I put a word search in the novel, but the joke's on you.
There aren't any words in there, so you're just gonna be staring at letters, you idiot.
But you know what? You finished it, and for that, my friend, I'm proud of you.
Thank you, I did finish it, I finished something.
Yeah, you finished something.
Read it out loud, Winston.
Read it out loud.
Read it out loud.
Read it out loud... - Okay, I'll read this damn thing; you asked for it.
This might be humiliating.
"No one in the sleepy mountain town of 'Writhe-em' City..."
That's Rhythm City.
"...knew what the meteor meant, but the one thing Mike Jr. did have was a whole lot of 'rittems.'"
Rhythm. - No, yeah.
"'Whoa, what bit me in the face?' Mike Jr. said to his dad Mike Sr., who sucks."
Sucks ... Mike Sr. sucks.
It's a major theme throughout this.
"Mike Sr. sucks a whole bunch, much more than his neighbor Rallo."
Never stop reading this.
"'Zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo.
"'Who let them zombies out that damn zombie zoo?
Uh-oh, watch your back, Laura.'"
And I guess Laura is another character that he introduces, but that's it.
And here's the word search.
Yeah, good luck, you idiot.
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola ... handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00
and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30
and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys that my mom's a little bit perky.
Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
Oh.
Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
Every year.
Hello, everyone.
This is my mom Joan.
Hi.
This is everybody.
Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
Come on, Cece, you know how to do this. - Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug b*lls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
All right.
Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
A hug ball?
Dad.
Well, hello, Bob.
You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
Mom!
It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...
No...
sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
Well done, Jessica Day.
Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What? I don't...
Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap ...  crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess. Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter? Are you...?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
Just go.
Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
Okay. - He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho! Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
Oh!
Oh!
Okay.
Hey.
What's up, man? Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one ... you know the rule.
Ah! Look at that right there.
That's...
Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
I, uh, I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad, you want to help us?
I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says...
It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you, but it's been months.
Jess.
What are you...?
I'm sorry, I thought, I thought, I ... I'm s ... I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram ...
all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me...
Salmonella...
Salmonella.
Okay.
I liked her.
You did?
No, no.
I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
Sure, Bob.
Yeah.
Do I remember that?
That was the night.
Great night.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after ... the afterparty.
The afterparty.
The after ... yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
Okay, I'm out of here.
Sit down, sit down.
I'm not doing a parent trap.
Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us. Here's the plan:
We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap ... there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap;
They don't work.
Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me. I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular. Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
Schmidt.
Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
Okay, yeah, and you are?
Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
I'm listening. - Go on.
The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
Yes. - It is on.
What are you doing?
I'm bored.
Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...
d*ad.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell ... d*ad.
d*ad. You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us, I mean, the voice of the NFL ... Steve Sabol? d*ad.
Also d*ad.
Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius. All you got to do is follow the money.
Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
You always follow the money.
Yeah, yeah.
Oil companies.
Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B.
Okay, stop. Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
Oh, really? - Yeah.
What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between... whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the... Carol is not a zombie?
She's a regular person?
No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight
thing where...
It's not like the Twilight...
No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really... you don't get it.
It's the same thing.
Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight,
that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
It's the same as Twilight...
Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
Yes.
It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen, I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth ...
Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
Is is working?
Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
Go h*t on her.
What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her...
Go h*t on your mother?
I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't h*t on...
Hey, Mom. Mom, uh, Jess...
Nick was just saying that your décolletage looks bewitching in that dress.
Right, Nick?
Thank you.
I like your de, uh...
your de... de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives, Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
All right, time for delts?
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
Stupid.
What's your calf situation like?
Calves? Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that. Some donkey raises?
One, two...
No, no, no, no, no. Wheelbarrow.
What's a wheelbarrow?
Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey! All right.
Turn him around. Faster.
Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome. Keep going.
All day. I can do this all day, Winston.
I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
Yeah, I got all day, too!
Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
This is great.
I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great...
at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
You want to give it a try? - Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
Well, no, no, no...
Is that good?
You're wasting it.
Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
What? Dad...
Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
You're such a liar.
Seriously, I'm not... Okay. Fine, you're right.
You need help.
Why do I do that?
I don't understand. Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off. Nick.
♪ Every time I try to tell you ♪
♪ The words just come out wrong ♪
Nick!
♪ So I have to say "I love you" ♪
♪ In a song.
Nick!
I love that.
Nick! Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
Can I top you off?
Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
What?!
I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...
Nick, this is not what we talked about.
I know but it got...
Give me that baster.
No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
Come on.
Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it? Yes.
Would I do it again? Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot? What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
You mean of you in the shower?
Yeah.
I got 'em.
I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation, Ha!
And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade ... it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
Who's hungry, right?
I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
He is still relevant.
Where? Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
I'll sleep on the couch.
What? What are you saying?
What?
Nothing happened.
What are you saying? What are you saying?
I'm with you.
You shouldn't be saying anything...
Anything,
'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not... you don't have any information about anything.
Information at all.
Nothing.
Happened.
The answer is nothing.
What?
Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
How do we prove that?
I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt. I mean...
No. We don't.
I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man. Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
Winston. Yeah, he'd do.
Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now. Am I right?
Yeah, love me some stuffing.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, right? - Yeah, let's go.
I'll kiss Winston.
I'll do it.
I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston...
Everybody else really hot, too?
Oh, wow.
Hey. Ooh!
Thank you.
Manly.
Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate it.
Okay? For you to have.
I appreciate that.
Just make sure you take... that's right...
What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins! Yes!
I'm thankful for twins. They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
Schmidts.
What?!
What?
In conclusion...
I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said... it couldn't be done.
They said,
"You're crazy, Jess."
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
Whoa, honey, what?
Whoa, hey, hey, wait. What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys. We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
No, no, no, no, no.
We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
It was the greatest day of my entire life.
Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex. Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on f*re, you two animals.
It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup. It mean nothing.
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs, I volunteer.
I volunteer, too.
I volunteered first.
Don't even matter.
You can't volunteer right after...
I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
Yup.
And I'm fine with that.
Joanie, what if it was like that?
That's not bad.
I saw something. You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural. Bring it to you.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious. No. What? Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
You have to admit that...
No.
What? ...
they're never gonna make it work.
No.
And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it. I knew it.
Didn't I tell you? I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
Oh. Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict? Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie. I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes. What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
Are you into pot? Is this a rehab?
What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off. Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
Honey?
Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess. Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't,
'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just...
I thought...
maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that...
since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely
Grey Gardens
the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm. Mmm.
What's up, bro?
What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
Not for me.
Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
Yeah.
I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No. No way.
Winston?
Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man. You can be Schmidt. I'm...
You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay... Schmidt?
Yes... I am...
Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug. I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
Love you, Mom.
Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again ... I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
And no more parent traps.
Okay.
Yeah. We're done with those.
Got it.
Been there, trapped that.
Bye.
Love you guys. Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
Okay, gas, electric, and cable comes out to $219.34.
Jessica?
Do you have anything to contribute?
Here we go.
They're not all legal tenders, but they have value, like...
Sure.
That's $5.00.
$5.00.
Library card.
Library's not just for books any more.
Mm-hmm.
Library card.
Also, you can check out compact discs.
What else? This is a fortune.
Um, yeah.
"You are lucky and success."
How ironic.
That's going right to the gas company. "Paid in full."
Jess, we can't keep covering for you.
Yes. I understand.
It's just that, um...
recently I went through a, uh, life change where I was fired.
Maybe I can borrow the money from my good friend... Winston?
You know, I really wish I could, Jess, but, uh...
I'm a single man now, so basically I have to be able to trick women into thinking that I can buy them stuff.
Okay!
Here is my share...
to the penny.
Yeah! I'm not the poorest!
Second poorest. Now you're the poorest.
That's gotta be rock bottom.
Yeah, I got it.
You know what? I'm shutting off the gas until you can get me the money.
What?
What are you talking about?
Don't scapegoat me. I just gave you my money.
That's called tough love, all right?
No more handouts.
Now, what are you going to do about it?
How are you gonna pay the gas bill?
I don't know.
I've got an idea.
Get a job.
The school year's already started.
I have a lot of decisions to make as far as my résumé
is concerned.
I have to choose a font, spacing, columns...
Okay, just update your résumé, you ninny.
Did you call me a ninny?
Yeah, I called you a ninny,
'cause you're acting like a ninny, you ninny!
Don't call me a ninny, I'm PMSing!
Ah! Why would you... yucky! No, no, no.
I don't want to hear it.
It hurts.
I feel like I've laid a million eggs and they're all hatching.
I feel like I want to m*rder someone, and also I want soft pretzels.
You know what? I feel the same way.
Shut up! Shut up, you!
'Cause I don't want to hear it!
I've had it!
If any of you cross me, I'm gonna kick the testicles clean off your body!
Clean off! You'll look like Ken dolls down there.
Because that's where I'm at right now.
Now which one of you guys wants to tell me to get a job?
Hmm?
Who wants to look me in the face and tell me to get a job?
Whatever.
"Whatever?"
What does that mean, huh? Whatever.
It better mean,
"Whatever you say, Jess."
I don't think it's fair that women have an excuse once a month to act irrationally angry when the rest of us have to keep it together all the time.
You're irrationally angry
365 days a year, Nick.
What are you talking about?
I will push if I want to push!
Come on!
I hate doors!
Really? Well, that's just your personal opinion,
'cause I don't have anger issues.
You guys think I have anger issues?
Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it an issue.
An issue is something you can fix.
Been that way since I can remember.
This is some watered-down nonsense.
You're some no-good shysters!
On an unrelated note, I've just decided to take a walk.
Fine! Leave!
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm gonna go get a job, like it's my...
Job? Shut up!
# Who's that girl? #
# Who's that girl? #
# It's Jess. #
Please don't do that, sir. Please.
I would love to sit by myself right now.
There's something real creepy about you, pal.
You want to get weird? Let's get weird.
You got a nice face.
Anger problem?
Living with them? Are you kidding me?
It's frustrating.
It's like... just get a job.
I like your hat.
I like how it's not a team or a logo, it's just blue.
Would you rather be covered in fish scales or feathers?
Scales?
Wow, you weirdo.
You want to see me jump really high?
Ha! Ah ha!
I'm afraid of dying, man.
Who am I?!
The enemy is en-e-my.
The enemy is the inner me.
Can you understand a word I'm saying?
You just nod at everything.
I need to change.
And you've showed me that.
I have an anger problem.
Thank you.
Can I get a hug?
I've got a story for you guys.
Ooh.
I met someone at work.
Emma Sharpe.
Divisional VP of all North America.
Wh-What are you doing in the break room?
This break room is in North America, isn't it?
Sure. That means I'm the Vice President of it.
I am the Vice President of everything in North America.
That sounds like... sexual harassment.
Robby, there's a fine line between sexual harassment and something awesome.
I thought you hated your co-workers.
You said they were a bunch of...
Pant-suited corporate She-Hulks?
Yeah, I know what I said.
Emma is the craziest woman to ever h*t on me.
Schmidt, you're such a nice guy.
Thank you. - What you deserve is a girl who respects you.
You know? A nice girl.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not into the nice thing, Robby. Doesn't do it for me.
Well, that's what I thought, too.
Yeah.
You know, until I found, uh... this one right here.
You mean Cece?
You think that I'm... nice?
No.
I think you're the nicest.
Mm.
Hmm.
Robby!
Yes, the man just left.
And he turned off the gas.
Yeah, I'm refusing to pay my gas bill as a matter of principle.
You'd like me to take the survey?
Of course I'll take the survey.
Schmidt?
Yeah, hold on.
Can I share some thing with you, man to man?
Oh, I'm...
You have to promise me you will not laugh.
Look, I'm... you're not talking to Nick, here.
You're talking to Schmidt.
Schmidt, I think I'm getting my period.
Okay.
This is a real thing, okay? I looked it up on the Internet.
It's called, uh,
"sympathy PMS," right?
Now, apparently this is an affliction that men suffer from all the time.
Right on.
I don't know how it happened, man, but somehow, I got on that woman's cycle of menstruation...
and I got that menstruation inside of me.
Winston!
Men can't get their periods.
Where would they put the tampon?
Hey! Are you calling me stupid?
You're the one that's stupid, okay?
You jack-faced butthole!
Who's the jack-faced butthole who turned off the hot water?!
Witch! What have you done to my body?
Shut up, you!
Why is there no hot water?!
Oh, I'm sorry, Jess.
If you don't pay, you don't play.
You also don't shower.
Are you serious?
Thank you, Denise.
Hey, hey!
Hey, great buddies.
Ow, my skin!
Okay.
Roommates... hey, buddy.
Don't poke me.
Something wonderful happened to me today, and I am no longer angry. It's gone.
Oh, shut up, Nick.
So let me get this straight:
Nothing at all's going to set you off?
That's right.
Nothing's gonna get to me,
'cause it's a new Nick Miller.
Awesome. Hey, Winston, tell him what you have.
Sympathy PMS. It's a real thing, I looked it up.
Sympathy PMS? What's that?
No!
PMS is mine!
Stop stealing my stuff, Winston.
You're telling me you're having a pre-menstrual something right now?
Yes.
Okay.
It's like a character in a Judy Blume novel.
No! You can't have my menzies.
He's got her menzies.
No part of this conversation is making me want to boil over with rage.
I feel really good, guys.
Hey, g*ng, why is the water so cold?
Schmidt turned off the hot water, because it's not enough that I have to go on an interview with the red devil in my belly, I also have to go unshowered.
there's no hot water in the whole house?
Yeah.
Seems strange.
Maybe a cold shower will wake you up to some harsh financial realities, Jessica Day.
You don't control my heat, Theodore P. Gasbag.
This is good!
We got a lot of feelings going around.
A lot of anger.
And you. You...
You're suddenly calm?
Yeah.
Really?
It feels like a fat man's sitting on my uterus.
I hear that.
Gonna go to the store!
Does anybody want anything?!
Thank you, Denise.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
Shut the door.
Whoa.
Quick reflexes. Good.
I am going to devour you.
You see that contract?
Oh, the thick one?
With all those tabbies?
Do me on it.
Pick that up.
Did you just ask me to pick it up to see me bend over?
No.
Oh, wait, I'm doing it.
Stand up.
What is this thing?
You're gonna have to sign it before anything can happen between us.
"Party A absolves Party B
"of any psychological trauma, whether temporary, permanent, future or imagined."
After we do what we do, you're gonna want to talk.
I can't allow that.
The less risk I incur, the more I can focus on creating a viable sexual experience for both of us.
You're gonna want to sign it.
"Possible exposure to lead paint."
Do I have a latex allergy?
That's very important.
"Guaranteed mercury poisoning"?
Mm.
Is this real?
You have till week's end to sign it.
What is your name?!
I can't keep thinking of you as my magical best friend with no name.
Joe. Tommy.
Louis. Tran.
Is it Tran?
What a crazy guess!
Beautiful name. Fits you perfectly.
My roommates are k*lling me.
Fine, you're right.
Okay, I like them, all right?
I hate myself. Is that what you want me to say?
Why do you always have to make everything so simple?!
How do you just get it?
How do I become you?
Show me the way, man. I'll do anything.
All right, man, I'm in.
You lead, my man.
All right, whatever is about to happen's gonna happen.
Jessica Day?
So why do you want to teach adults?
I think it's really inspiring that these people have chosen to go back to school, you know, that they want to read
To k*ll A Mockingbird,
that they want...
Oh!
I named my dog Boo after...
After Boo Radley?
Exactly.
That's amazing.
Oh, my God.
She was a puppy.
She's so cute.
I know.
Such a cutie.
This cup is so tiny.
So cute.
Sorry, how did she fit in the cup?
I just don't understand.
Just physically, how did she get so small?
I'm sorry, um... I'm sorry, I got this... I don't know what's wrong.
So weird.
Never happens to me.
She's really cute.
Yes, she was.
Did she die?
It's fine.
It's been two years.
Puppy... in a... cup.
So... we're both dog people, right?
Schmidt, am I nice?
No.
Thank you.
Nobody thinks I'm a nice girl, okay?
I'm the mistake.
Ah, Robby.
Midwestern heart, Midwestern body.
I'm the one who messes things up.
I agree with you.
I feel like he doesn't even know me.
You're getting your smell all over the comforter.
Oh, my God.
Took me months to get rid of that heavenly curry smell.
What happens when he realizes he was wrong about me the entire time?
He's just gonna run away.
I would, I would never run away from you.
But if I did, I would run way faster than Robby.
'Cause he's slow.
And I'm fast.
Maybe I'm just not meant for a functional relationship.
You know me, Schmidt.
You don't ever have to be nice around me.
I'm not scared of you.
I mean, I'm bad.
I do... I do bad things.
I don't think you're a nice girl.
Think you're the worst.
No.
No...?
No. I can't do this to Robby.
But you're a bad person. We discussed that.
You're a bad person, I'm a bad person. - Yep.
We can totally do this. No qualms.
I have a qualm. I have a qualm.
You don't have a qualm.
We sold our qualms, and we used the profits to buy perfect bodies.
Robby is right.
Hmm.
I'm nice.
I'm not nice, all right?
And I like Robby, but that is doing nothing right now from stopping me from wanting to kiss you.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
But I-I don't want to stop.
I really don't.
I will never stop wanting to kiss you.
I am a monster.
I got to go.
Yeah, sure. Have fun.
Thank you. I really needed this.
Mm-hmm.
And I...
I'm a monster.
Okay.
What is this place?
What are you...?
What would you like?
What does this mean?
Let's not do this.
Let's not take off our clothes.
Let's go back to the park where it was good...
What do I know?
We're taking our pants off?
Okay. Keep those underwear on, am I right?
Yeah.
Stay on. Underwear good.
Why are you cradling me like a baby, friend?
This is not how guys of my generation hang out.
This is a moment that got away from me, man.
Oh, that's my butt.
This is intimate.
How did you know?
You are a huge baby.
Yeah, I am.
I am a huge baby.
Forget it, I'm done.
I'm not getting a teaching job.
Mm.
Just can't go back out there, you know?
Oh, I feel you, Jess.
I took a sick day.
I just stayed at home and did a watercolor of mountains.
So you gonna get this, like, every month?
I mean, it's a possibility from all the information that I've read on the Internet.
That women like you are the alpha.
What?
You're like the powerful moon, and all the women in your life are just latched on to your cycle.
In my case, grown-ass man.
Oh, yeah, good news.
The g*ng's all here.
Guys just PMS-ing?
Not in the mood today.
Don't really feel like being yelled at, so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and leave, because right now I'm feeling very fragile.
I understand.
What's wrong with you?
I'm no longer angry!
All the anger that used to be inside of me is gone!
It's gone, it's gone!
This is the worst thing I've ever seen.
What is wrong with you?
No.
Period's got you down?
That is such a raw deal.
Want me to get you a sanitary napkin?
Ew!
Okay, I won't get that.
But you're okay with pads or tampons or whatever it is that you're using?
Tell me about your day, please.
I want to get into your universe.
Let's rap it out. Go.
Floor is yours, pal.
Talk, talk, talk.
I want to listen.
No.
30 seconds of direct eye contact?
Stop it, Nick. Please, stop.
In three seconds, I'll be silent.
One, two...
I b*mb all my interviews.
What? What happened?
I was sabotaged by my baby box, which means I'm never gonna trust anything that comes out of it.
So that rules out a family.
I know just the thing you need.
Come with me.
Welcome to the wonderful world of water massage.
You are a piece of seaweed.
You are totally happy.
Ow!
I don't mean to touch your boobs!
You're touching my boobs!
I don't mean to touch your boobs!
Fail, fail, fail.
The next move is...
Oh, my...!
Relaxing is important. Relaxing is important.
Relax!
Oh, no.
What are you trying to do?!
k*ll me?!
It worked for me.
I was trying to help you.
I've been watching you doubt yourself for months.
I'm not doubting myself.
You're doubting yourself, Jess.
No, Nick, it's PMS.
It's not PMS.
You got knocked down.
It's time to get back up.
And get up long enough for one of these bozos to hire you.
I believe in you.
So does that guy.
Hey.
Think you can do that?
And if you don't, I'm gonna water massage you again.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Can you do that?
Yes!
Jessica Day?
Yes, I'm here.
Weren't you here the other day?
Weren't you here the other day?
Yes, I was.
Well, I signed it. Please note the added provision.
In any autobiographical account of my life, you want to be referred to as Moises Perdue.
Non-negotiable.
But you're fine with the rest of it?
Look, I'm a depraved freak, and I want to wander into your Narnia of sexual terror and emerge like a freshly birthed calf.
Put your hands out.
Let's do this.
Are you ready?
I'm ready. All right.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Interesting technique.
Hold tight.
I mean, I could totally get out of this.
What, have you never bound somebody before?
I got to start over.
This your first time?
Are you rejecting me?
No, I... no.
I mean...
Because legally... you can't.
Now take off your pants.
Okay.
Now.
All right, all right.
I got it. I got it.
Right there. Oh.
No, I got it.
Hold on, I got it.
I did it. I did it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
drumroll please.
Cut! Cut, Nick!
Snare drum.
I shouldn't have to specify.
Jess, that was a cymbal.
Cymbals are part of the drum kit.
Yeah.
Nevertheless, we are gathered here today to celebrate the reemployment of Jessica F. Day.
Not my middle initial.
Who will once again be in the classroom, molding the minds of children.
Actually, I'm gonna be remolding the minds of grown-ups,
'cause I'm gonna be teaching creative writing to adults.
So, what, are you gonna be, like, reading a bunch of weirdos' writing?
Well, I hope you like stories about vampires and bad childhoods.
I do.
You're gonna get them.
In any case, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are thrilled that you will once again have a reason to shower daily.
Yes.
Now, let there be gas.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ah, yeah!
Gonna be hot water in six to ten minutes, fool! What?! - Yeah!
Schmidt! Schmidt!
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!
Where's Winston?
Where is Winston?
Go get Winston!
Where is he?
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!
Schmidt! Schmidt!
Come on, jump around with us.
Come jump with us, Winston.
Sleepy eyes.
Hey.
What's going on, man?
I don't really have PMS.
I know. You're a man.
I miss Shelby.
This is all about your breakup?
I know just the thing you need.
Oh, no.
Just relax and breathe.
I'll take your shoulders.
I'll take your feet.
This is really weird, man.
Really weird.
Cool vibe, man.
What are you guys doing now?
What have I gotten myself into?
Hey, lady, crushing that flute, babe.
And breathe.
Okay, I'm trying. I'm gonna do that.
Whoa. Just chill out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing with my legs?
No! Come on! Come on, chill out!
Nick, what are you doing, man?!
Reset. Let's reset.
This is weird!
No! No! No!
Nick, where do you even buy sheets like this?
They're the thread count of a paper towel.
Okay, I don't know what to do.
I thought these sheets were good.
You said these sheets were fine.
They're fine. Relax.
He's freaking out.
You know, Amelia's coming in town...
Which one of your depressing ex-girlfriends is Amelia?
Freshman year.
* You stopped in my room *
* For no reason *
* I was pretty cool to say "Come in" *
* You're sitting on my bed *
* I feel like there's vibing *
* What do I do? *
* The sexual tension is crazy. *
I never told her how I felt.
And she's here for a couple days on work.
This is my chance.
I even got a new shirt.
That's a cool shirt;
I like that shirt.
Yeah, look cool, man.
You making fun of my shirt, Schmidt?
Oh, my God!
Jess, please stop working at the haunted house.
It's just through the weekend.
You all get free tickets, you know.
Oh, no, I'm not going.
I don't do haunted houses.
What? You scared?
Uh, well, Little kids are scared. I just don't like it.
I got it. You look like a zombie Woody Allen.
Yeah.
These brains are terrible.
And such-such small portions.
On Christmas, I like to eat Chinese people's brains.
They're the only ones that are open.
Zombie Cristina Barcelona.
Yeah, I have nothing to add to this.
I'm gonna be home late tonight, you guys.
Uh, so don't wait up, 'cause I'm going over to Sam's house to mix his batter.
Oh, yeah.
Not in that costume.
I don't know.
Costume kind of works for me.
Kind of a sexy, undead driver's ed teacher.
It's my sweet spot.
Sam doesn't care what I look like.
'Cause I'm not his girlfriend.
And I'm gonna kick him to the curb once I've used his body like a moisturizer sample.
Hey-yo!
I couldn't afford my therapist, so I ate his brains.
Marx brothers.
Hear, hear.
That's the one.
Good stuff.
* Who's that girl? *
*Who's that girl?*
* It's Jess. *
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
Um, here's your wallet.
Oh, thank you.
You must have dropped it on our most recent trip to No Pants City.
Just so you know, I didn't look in it.
'Cause I don't care and I respect your privacy.
Then how'd you know it was my wallet?
Well played, Sam Sweeny...
Born in Boston, six-four.
I didn't know you worked in the E.R.
Until I got here, though.
Yeah, pediatrics.
You're a doctor for children.
It's, you know, mostly paperwork.
That why you have so many cute cards on the wall?
"Dear Dr. Sam..."
They call you Dr. Sam?
"Thank you for making me better.
I love you, and so does my bunny."
Nice kid, but she can't draw for crap.
I mean, she just traced Bugs Bunny.
I didn't know you were a, like, caring person.
Same guy. Same guy.
I'm the same guy that did you in that falafel restaurant, you remember?
And a dirty one, at that.
Mm-hmm.
Please don't do this.
Dr. Sam.
Don't start thinking I'm some amazing guy.
This is why I don't tell girls what I do.
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I feel nothing. This is purely physical.
Dr. Sam!
Oh, Ben! What's up?
Fish tails?
I, uh...
How could I say no, buddy?
Fish tail! Fish tail!
Up top!
This makes me feel nothing.
I feel nothing.
I haven't worn these in years.
Here you go.
Wow, Schmidt.
You've got so many boots.
You know who doesn't have a lot of boots?
Guys who aren't getting laid on the reg.
Ooh, trust me, I know. Shelby and I agreed Mm-hmm.
That we're gonna dress sexy this Halloween, so...
hopefully that'll make us want to have sex with each other.
You know, at night, I can actually feel gusts of frigid air coming from beneath your door.
I get it, Schmidt. We're in a rut.
Without sex, she's not your girlfriend, okay?
She's a friend that you buy meals for.
Winston, I get it, man.
You're... you're scared to end it.
You're just like Cece.
Cece's scared to end it with Robby, because clearly she's still nuts about me.
Robby's nice. Good guy, man.
He always has gum.
"Oh, Robby... he's such a nice guy."
I'll show you nice guy. Boom.
Punch him in his face.
Yeah, put you in a guillotine choke hold.
And then Robby's like, "Oh, my God!"
"I can't believe this. Young Abraham Lincoln is choking me out in his guillotine."
You're going as young Abe Lincoln for Halloween?
Statistically speaking, every American thinks about Abraham Lincoln at least once a day.
And Cece's American, so...
Thank you for that information, Schmidt.
Yeah.
What's up, Robby?
What's up, Robby, you stupid idiot?
You had an alter ego, remember?
Yeah.
The guy who'd been in a coma who woke up thinking he had invented pie.
Oh, I got a great new idea for a dessert!
Wait a second, what year is it?
That's awesome you liked that.
No, I'm really glad you're here.
Welcome to Los Angeles.
L.A., as the locals call it.
This is the city where many scenes from the film Beverly Hills Chihuahua were sh*t.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Mm-hmm.
I made you up a couch.
Wow.
The double eye patch.
You trying to impress me?
Yes!
Absolutely!
You kidding?
A doctor?
Mm-hmm.
I had him pegged for a part-time tennis pro or an unemployed handsome guy.
He cares about people for a living; it's so much hotter.
You're starting to like him now.
No, no, no, we're just coworkers.
On the night shift.
These fit great, Jess.
Really, thank you so much.
It's like a childhood dream come true for me.
To be a Ninja Turtle.
And to have a beautiful girlfriend, of course.
Uh-huh. Thank you.
What am I looking at here?
Robby, man to man, you didn't want to wear something, I don't know, a little more form flattering?
Maybe like a pile of towels, the number eight?
Schmidt.
I know. But how could I not knock down such low-hanging fruit?
Speaking of low-hanging fruit, Jess, you didn't want to let out the pants a little bit?
No.
Not even a touch?
No.
You want to look at your work?
Looks great.
Not to an eight-year-old child.
Who's just staring right down the barrel.
Enough.
Are you guys coming to the Halloween festivities tomorrow?
Actually, we're...
I think you should come.
It's for charity.
You like charity, Robby, right?
Yeah, sure. Like Cece dating you.
Awesome. Um...
Why not?
No. I mean, We have that thing...
Don't worry about my friends.
I would love to hang out with your friends.
I think we should do it, because I want to wear this costume out.
You know what I mean? So I say yes.
Just, uh, keep the pumpkins away from me, okay?
I kind of cut myself last Halloween.
I mean, not on a Kn*fe.
I-I, you know, I cut myself on the pumpkin.
You should've made a move in college.
No, I didn't have moves, Amelia.
My moves were Singing to you and trying to give you back rubs and...
I do remember you picking a lot of eyelashes off my cheeks.
Didn't you think it was weird that I kept showing up at your door, telling you I had a family tragedy?
How many grandparents did you think I had?
I had a bad bag of moves, lady.
Well, they're not bad any more, Nick Miller.
Ah, that's great.
That is for real.
There's more where that came from.
Uh-oh.
Oh, that's good stuff.
That is good.
Hey.
Sam's in there.
Yeah, Amelia's in there.
High five for sluts.
Yeah!
Hey.
I think I might like Sam.
Jess, I thought the whole thing was how you didn't like him.
I know, but then...
Hey.
Hi. You must be Amelia. I'm Jess.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nick's told me a lot about you.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, it finally happened.
It's crazy... Nick and Amelia.
Together.
Together, yeah.
Together, yeah.
Together.
Really? Right now?
Okay.
Yeah, good.
Okay.
All right, call me tonight?
Actually, tonight's the last night of this haunted house thing.
Here's a crazy idea.
What if you came?
Well, I don't really do, uh, the, you know, sort of costume thing.
I'm gonna be dressed up.
I think you should dress up, too.
'Cause it'd be cool.
For me.
Okay. I'll try to make it, darling.
Well, I wish I hadn't have seen that.
You wish you hadn't seen that?
I wish I hadn't seen...
Fair point.
What if tonight's a test?
If he shows up wearing a costume, he likes me.
Sound logic.
I know.
Jess, I-I... Jess, I was kidding.
How do the boots feel, man?
Feel fantastic, man.
Well, there's more where that came from.
Got a lot of boots.
Whoo, looky here!
One of my brothers in blue.
That g*n looks real. Let me see that for a second.
LAPD! Stand down! Stand down!
I'm standing, I'm standing! Look at that!
Butch it up, Axel Foley.
Shelby's coming.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey. What, uh...
What-what are you?
I'm reigning cats and dogs!
Get it?
Reigning...
cats and dogs.
Those stuffed animals are gonna look good on the floor of my bedroom.
Oh!
What are you doing?!
No, it's cool, it's cool.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, Robby.
Hey, look, I get it.
Guy who sh*t John Lennon dressed as a Ninja Turtle.
No.
Cece, you're an angel, as always.
Get off my horse, Schmidt.
Hey, Lincoln, right? That's awes...
You know, I was just thinking about Lincoln today.
Yeah, Robby, we all were.
This is kind of funny.
The two of you together on that horse, you kind of look like a bride and a groom.
I will throw you off of this horse with my bare hands. I will.
I'm gonna tell him how I feel tonight.
You are?
Think so.
Boo!
What'd you carve here?
Oh, it's a secret. I'm not done yet.
What's wrong with me?
I wanted this for so long with her, and now... it's just too much.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
You want to know why I don't like haunted houses?
Why?
Because they're just like relationships.
You walk in all confident, and then once you get in, it's not what you thought it was gonna be, and it's scary.
Nice, you've liked her for a long time.
Go in the "haunted house."
I'm gonna go in the "haunted house."
Ta-da! That's me, that's you, and that's our dog.
I look so scared.
Bride and groom?
No!
No, I'm here with the Ninja Turtle!
Bride and Ninja Turtle.
I don't get it.
I don't get it, either.
Like she lost a bet or something.
What is wrong with you?
Seriously!
It's okay, Cece.
No, it's not okay!
You need to go home and change, Schmidt.
I know you have more costumes in your closet.
Those costumes are for Purim. Purim's in March.
I don't care! You're doing this intentionally just to mess with me!
All right, calm down.
Everybody just... just calm down.
All right, Schmidt? Let's take a walk.
Let's take a walk.
Look, let's just cut the crap, okay?
I know you think I'm dumb, and you can h*t on Cece and make fun of me all day long, but I'm not going anywhere, all right?
You're a big guy, you know that?
Yeah.
Luckily, I've got a stone forehead.
What?
I'm sorry.
No, it's cool, man.
You just tried to head-butt me.
I had to stop you.
No, yeah, yeah.
I got you. I got you.
All right.
Damn it!
Schmidt, you did it again.
How do you see that coming every time?
You wind up. You make, like, a little wind-up thing.
I just...
h*t me right in the forehead.
Yeah, well, you tried to head-butt me with your forehead.
Yeah, I know I was trying to head-butt you.
Okay, listen.
I think there's two options here.
We can either go the way that things have been going and we're going to have a big problem, or we can just knock this off and let's be friends, okay?
I'm sorry.
Okay. I'm sorry, too.
I'm sorry, too.
My bad.
No, truce.
All right, truce.
Will you stop trying to head-butt me, man?
I just...
Look at this guy.
Looking great.
Oh, my God.
What?
He came.
He's not wearing a costume.
Yeah, but he came, so...
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, I got to sneeze.
I'm a clown for you.
Just don't ask me to wear this in bed.
Okay.
I think, when he comes here tonight, I'm just going to be like,
"Sam, crazy idea...
why don't we take this to another level?"
And pretend like I'm just thinking of it, but I'm not...
Can you hand me my coffee?
Yeah.
Zombie, just tell him the truth.
Mummy's right. Take the big swing.
It's okay to be vulnerable.
You guys are right.
Life as a doctor.
Your phone must just be bl*wing up with life-saving texts, huh?
"Don't die on me, Danny Boy! Use the paddles!"
No, it's a girl.
Oh, I thought Jess was working.
It's another girl. Just a weekend thing.
Does Jess know you're texting other girls?
Yeah. We're, like, totally honest with each other.
You know? I mean, she wants a relationship less than I do.
It's actually awesome.
Right.
And you're coming over tonight, hmm?
And she's going to talk to you.
Ooh.
All right, man.
You've got to be kidding me.
Just do it, Nick.
Don't be scared, Nick.
You're a grown man. This is a haunted house.
Game time.
I have no idea how they deep-fry a turkey dinner, but I am so glad they do because I love it.
Do you love your legs? Because, I'll tell you, diabetes doesn't.
Where have you been?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I totally lost track of time.
We decided that we're going to hang out more.
All of us are going to hang out more.
You know, 'cause I remember you saying that missed hanging out with Schmidt, so...
Oh, Robby.
You said that?
Yeah, I... yeah, I... I said it, but...
No, because I want to hang out with you, too.
With Robby there?
Yeah, with Robby there.
Good.
Good.
Oh, yeah, good, good.
Good.
Lincoln, bringing the nation back together again.
Jess!
Jess, where are you?
Watch your step!
It's just a recording.
Good, good. Fun.
Okay. It's not a race. It's not a...
Welcome to the morgue, Officer and...
Sorry. I have no idea what...
that whole thing... I don't...
I'm reigning cats and dogs.
What?
"Reigning" like a queen, But... but "raining"
like the weather.
No.
"It's raining cats and dogs!"
Right.
It's a joke.
Not really.
What?
Hmm? No, I'm saying, like, it's not really... not really funny.
It's hilarious.
I thought you were going to dress sexy.
A sense of humor is sexy.
I don't want to date the queen of Cats and Dogs.
Reigning cats and dogs.
Makes no sense.
I don't see the queen of England running around with a cape and British people stapled to it.
What?
When is the last time you heard somebody say,
"Man, you know what's sexy?
A woman with stuffed animals taped to her back."
Look how good I look! Look how stylish I look.
That's not sexy. I feel like I'm getting a speeding ticket.
Ooh! Shelby, you made me so mad, my mustache is coming off!
Why do you have a mustache glued on top of your mustache.
Why aren't we having sex?
Shut up, bitch.
Sorry.
Shelby, this is not working.
It's just not.
I know.
Oh, I get it.
Reigning cats and dogs.
It's funny. It is.
Jess.
Jessica Day, where are you?
No, no!
Very effective. Very scary.
Come in! Come in!
This is fun. This is entertaining.
Oh, no! Jess!
No! No!
Jess! No!
No, I'm her friend.
Somebody help me!
This is my nightmare!
I didn't punch a girl. I punched a horrifying monster.
You of all people should know this, Frankenstein.
You're the real monster.
Oh, give me a break.
Jess, are you okay?
Yeah. It's nothing.
Nick just punched me in the face.
What?!
Oh, my God! No, it was an acc...
What is wrong with you?
Jess, I'm sorry!
All right. Look away.
All right, well, the bruise is going to heal, but I don't know what to do about the giant stitches.
I mean, those are going to scar.
And you're looking a little pale.
What have you been eating?
Brains.
Habit.
I think we should go.
Sam. Uh, wait.
Um... um...
uh, I... I like you.
I like you, too, Jess.
No, but, um...
I care about you, and, um, I want to ask you out for real.
So... will you go out with me?
I can't.
I told you...
what I wanted, and I wasn't lying.
Yeah, um...
I just thought maybe you were scared to say it.
I'm not.
Not scared, you know.
This is how I feel.
Do you want me to go?
Hey.
Hey.
You punch a girl?
Yes, I did. Uh, I'm a coward.
I'm scared of haunted houses.
And I'm scared of you... I always have been.
That's right. That is what I've been trying to remember.
I was like, "Nick is great."
Why didn't I realize it years ago?"
And it's because you could not tell me how you felt.
So you always knew I liked you?
You drove me home every Thanksgiving break.
You lived in Chicago;
I lived in Florida.
Well, I was trying to avoid the tolls.
How do you feel about me now?
Great. Good.
I can't believe that after all this time, you still can't be honest with me.
I'm sorry, all right? It's my fault.
Okay, I fell in love with you the first time I saw you... that's crazy.
I didn't even know you. It was just this idea of you.
And then... it just wasn't what I thought.
And what's up with the way you kiss?
It's like reverse CPR. It's like you're...
Hey.
I'm not an idea of a person.
I'm an actual person.
Okay.
Ready? Uh-huh.
One, two, three.
All right, let's try it one more time. Let's see if we can h*t the top.
I think you guys deserve the couples costumes.
Bride and groom.
Aw.
How sweet of you.
Thank you.
Take the hat.
It's... that's, like, the most important part.
Very nice of you to do that, Schmidt.
Hold this.
Okay, I'm not... I don't need to wear a second costume.
This and the hat and the blazer's enough, so that's...
You need it, Robby.
Where you going with this here, buddy? I...
You're not going to... the pants, too?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're fine. We're good.
It's important, man. Need to wear the whole thing.
Just... what are you going to wear?
Plan B was always Matthew McConaughey in Magic Mike, so...
Always got to have a plan B, Robby.
Thanks, man.
Wow. I mean, look at his thighs.
They're like fleshy tree trunks.
Whoa.
I mean, he just knows how to work the crowd.
I mean, his thighs are, like, the size of my head.
Reigning cats and dogs!
Yeah!
Coat of arms.
You are so awesome!
You know, I may not actually be Abraham Lincoln, but I witnessed the emancipation of one black guy tonight...
from a terrible relationship.
Come on.
I know I said you shouldn't put yourself out there, but I'm glad you did.
You should be with somebody who's crazy about you, Jess.
Thanks, Nick.
That'd be really nice if it wasn't coming from somebody who just punched me in the face.
Sorry about that.
All right, you ready?
Mm-hmm.
Let's do it.
All right. Let's do it.
Okay.
Jess, let's make this right.
All right.
I can't do this.
I'm glad you're you,
'cause Jess Day could...
Ow! Mother of... Damn it!
# Happy birthday, dude! #
Hello.
I made you a cake.
Can't. Booked a car show for tomorrow, and I have been so good this week.
I lost four pounds.
Oh, come on, Cece.
It's your birthday. We're gonna eat cake, we're gonna watch Clueless on VHS, and we're gonna try to make prom dresses out of towels.
Obviously, just like we always do.
As if!
As if is, like, the funniest thing ever.
I wish I had a stepbrother to fall in love with.
I know, right? Paul Rudd.
You know, actually, I thought maybe this year, we could go out, you know?
We go party tonight.
Let dogs out. Catch gypsy.
Yeah. Yeah, Nadia wants me to go to this last-minute thing she found out about, so I thought we could all, you know, just go out tonight.
You, me, Nadia, the girls.
The models?
Yes, Jess, the models. Please?
You and I have never spent my birthday apart, ever.
Except for the one time in seventh grade where you walked out of my sleepover because you claimed...
When you struck me in the breast.
But I didn't even touch boob, because you know, we all knew you were stuffing...
Oh, my God.
We were all stuffing. Stuffing? We all stuffed.
You've seen my grandmother. I was not stuffing.
Yes, we were.
It was seventh grade.
I've been like this since I was seven.
You're...
Come out with us tonight!
Please, please, please!
Okay.
Okay.
I'll come.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
I so excited.
I shake this thing that my mama gave me.
YOLO!
# Who's that girl? #
#Who's that girl?#
# It's Jess. #
The Galapagos tortoise, or Galapagos giant tortoise, Unbelievable...
Is the largest living species of tortoise...
Spectacular.
Hey, do you think Jess would be mad if I got a turtle and named it Jess, even though I had that name picked out before she moved in?
A turtle?
Thinking man's best friend, Schmidty.
In our home? Over my turtle-disease-ridden d*ad body.
Whatever, dream k*ller. What's this?
Got you a cookie.
What, you have, like...?
Have, like, an extra?
No.
So you just, like, got me a cookie?
Yeah, I was thinking about you.
What do you mean you were thinking about me?
What do you mean? I don't know. I was thinking about you.
Think about you a lot, bro.
Why?
I don't know. Because you're my friend, you're on my mind.
What, do you not think about me?
Of course not!
Oh.
Schmidt got me a cookie.
Oh. Very nice.
What do you guys think?
Whoa! -
Smokin' hot.
I'm going out tonight with Cece and her model friends, and I'm going for "promising ballerina turned streetwalker."
You have too much joie de vivre.
Okay, you want to look a little bit more bored, tired.
Just altogether disengaged.
More tired... more, like, sick-like.
Really let your bones prop you up.
Did you put shoe polish on your eyes?
I never understand you women... God.
Eye shadow, man.
That's...?
Oh, that's makeup?
I would take that off.
That looks crazy.
Can't believe I have to deal with the models just to hang out with Cece.
Last time we hung out, it was awful.
I figure the best way to talk to models is just point to objects and describe them.
The table is round.
It's also flat.
Yes, the table is round, and it's flat.
Oh, look, a lamp.
I love Cece, and these are Cece's friends, so I should be able to get along with them.
I should be able to deal with the fact that they think I look like a monkey...
from a Russian cr*cker ad.
Whatever.
It's Cece's birthday. It's her special night.
I can get drunk, point at furniture if that means I can spend some quality time with my BFF.
Hey, is it totally obvious that I'm not wearing underwear?
# Because it should be. #
And that makes two of us.
Hey!
You made it!
Sorry I'm late.
They let in a lot of people ahead of me... like, a lot.
Saving the best for last.
Monkey cr*cker.
Monkey cr*cker.
Monkey, monkey, where you keep the crackers?
This is so much fun.
Schmidt?
So, it turns out there's more than one type of turtle.
I could go Eastern Box, or spur thighed, or nearsighted loner.
What was that? You just grunt at me?
Wasn't a grunt.
That was a grunt, Schmidt.
It was a "hurumph."
Hurumph.
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way; it was not a grunt.
Serena Williams. That was a grunt.
It's all good, man, all right?
It's all "smoove in the groove."
Mellow, man.
Mega-mellow.
Okay.
Schmidt, what the hell are you doing?
You don't think about me?
What are you talking about?
Earlier today, when I gave you the cookie, I heard very clearly, "I don't think about you, Schmidt."
Why would I think about you?!
Because we're friends, we're not animals.
We're men, Schmidt! The only time a man is allowed to think about another man is when that man is Jay Cutler.
I don't know who Jay Cutler is!
Why are you saying
"Cutler" like that?
And I also don't know what is allowed in the Cold-Hearted Republic of Nick Miller, but I do know how I feel.
Ugh!
And I know how much you love cookies.
And I saw it there behind the glass, and I thought, "Nick Miller... I'm gonna buy him that."
If I could give you that cookie back, I would.
Nothing would make me happier than to throw it up, mash it into cookie-shape, and shove it down your throat!
You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
No, that's not...
You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
No.
You're not mama-birding anybody any cookie.
Schmidt, I don't want to mama-bird you a cookie.
What is your problem, Schmidt?
No mama-birding here!
Okay, I think I got it, okay...
# Monkey, monkey #
# Where you keep your cr*cker? #
# Monkey, monkey, you are comrade best! #
Whoo.
You know what?
The dance is surprisingly sexual for a children's cr*cker.
Do song again... "Dance Monkey."
I don't want to dance...
"Dance Monkey."
# Monkey, monkey #
# Where you keep your crackers? #
Dance monkey, dance monkey.
cr*cker, please!
Dance monkey.
cr*cker, please!
Monkey! Monkey!
No. You know what?
Monkey! Monkey!
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!
Monkey, monkey, monkey!
Dance Monkey... -
You know what?
No! Stop it!
I don't want to, okay? I'm done.
You guys are the worst!
You're the worst. I'm sorry, but it's true.
All these r*cist in-jokes about Romanians.
Well, guess what? I'm one-eighth Romanian!
Monkey, no! - And I don't know why Cece would want to spend her birthday here.
It's like years of modeling have made her dumber.
Nice, Jess.
No! Cece.
No, I'm sorry. I didn't...
It's official.
We got to turtle-proof this loft.
Schmidt cares about you so much, man, and you don't even think about him.
Are you being serious right now?
Are you really taking Schmidt's side on this?
I am, because I know how you are.
I just don't know why he would run away.
All I ever did was love him.
This rock is so round.
I'm gonna go put it in a jar.
And nothing has changed. Nothing has changed, Nick.
You think Schmidt is in the right, and I am in the wrong here?
You realize I say good night to you every night, and you never say good night back?
No.
What is the problem, Nick?
Do you not want me to have a good night?
I can't just go around saying good night to everyone, and buying people cookies.
I am not a titan of finance, sir.
Do you know, once a week he goes into your room and cleans it, and then returns everything the way he found it?
And I'm weird in this situation?
The dirty old T-shirts, which he washes.
I didn't ask for that... I like living in my filthy messes.
That's the point, man. You didn't have to ask.
Nobody buys people cookies for no reason.
You still don't get it, do you?
Nobody.
That wasn't a cookie, damn it! That was a...
What?
Man, that was a piece of his heart.
Now, if you don't mind, good... night.
I'm sorry, but in my defense, Nadia just spent an hour explaining to me how to drink vodka with my butt.
You just embarrassed me in front of my colleagues.
Are you kidding me? It's not like you work in the UN.
You judge me for being a model.
Yes, I do.
You always have.
It's your birthday, and you won't eat cake.
Cece, you're better than that; you really are.
I just... I just feel sorry for you sometimes.
You feel sorry for me?
You just h*t me in the boob.
It was an accident.
It was not an accident.
Fine. It wasn't.
Oh... my... God!
Ho, ho.
What? Huh?
Huh?
You want that?!
Go. Just go.
Ugh! Uh!
What you gonna do now, huh?
Just...
What?
What? What? What?
What?
What? What?
What?
You should go.
Thanks for a great birthday.
Cece?
You drink with mouth?
Tonight, I drink with mouth.
Well, guess who's not getting a turtle?
They were out of turtles.
I bought a tiny cowboy hat for nothing.
Schmidt's not talking to you right now.
We're still on this?
Schmidt is tired of doing things for you that go unnoticed.
lining your shoes up at the door...
Don't line my shoes up at the door any more.
...Recording your favorite TV shows...
I appreciate that.
...The turn-down service.
The turn-down service is weird And I never asked you to do that.
Well, I guess those chocolate mints Just disappeared on their own.
Oh, I thought we weren't talking.
We're not.
Then why do I hear words Coming out that stupid hole in your face?
I'm a human being, and I'm entitled to my emotions.
Are you crying?
No.
Are you seriously crying, Schmidt?
I'm not crying.
Rough night, you guys.
I forgot to take out my contacts.
I think they're fused to my eyeballs.
What's going on?
Did you guys watch p*rn together again?
Why do you keep doing that?
It's always awkward.
Oh, wow.
What the hell was that?
In March, I will have been living with Schmidt for ten years.
I know that because he sent me an e-mail asking how I want to celebrate our "tin anniversary."
How did you guys become friends?
Was it an accident?
Did you h*t him with your car and you became his reluctant caretaker?
He lived in my freshman dorm.
And one day, he was just there.
Hey, hey, whoa, man, what are you doing in here?
That's my ramen.
It's better this way.
Y-You add water to it, you weirdo.
It's not a dry treat, it's a soup.
Who are you?
Schmidt.
You freak me out, man.
This is cool. We got a good vibe going, man.
You're a super weird guy.
Hey, sit there while I throw things at you.
Body slam!
No!
Don't do this! No!
And then he was always there.
And the truth is, is, Schmidt loves me so much, and to be honest, Jess, it scares me.
I mean, I don't think I deserve all of Schmidt's love.
All I do is tease him.
I mean, of course you do.
That's all you can do.
Do you think I'm a bad friend?
No, no, I'm a bad friend.
I got mad at Cece for being a model.
It's a dumb thing to be.
We got in a boob fight.
Feels like I fell forward on a treadmill.
I'm just gonna say this... I find that arousing, and let's move on.
Just, she's smart, you know, and she's interesting and she could be doing anything else with her life or at least trying.
You know, the weird thing is, I was actually there when she got discovered.
You, take your glasses off.
Okay.
I can take my glasses off.
I guess I was always disappointed with her for calling that lady.
It's just, when I hear all the stuff about Cece's profession...
like, the dieting... it's crazy...
and the butt drinking and the...
Did you say
"butt drinking"?
Yeah.
You can't say "butt drinking"
And then not explain what it is.
Yeah.
It has two of my four favorite things.
I just feel like we have nothing in common, you know?
Yeah.
Do you ever wonder why we're friends with these people, Jess?
And, worse, if we met them now, you think we'd still be friends with them?
Maybe not.
I should go talk to her.
Well, Nick, I'm out of tears... plumb out.
All that's left is just yellowish goo.
That's right, Nick... goo.
That's a third of my life.
Cece.
Oh, hey, Nadia, sorry.
This Wilmer Valderrama.
Um, Nadia, that's not...
I mean... or what I thought he would look like in person.
Nice to meet you.
Big fan.
Where's Cece?
Cece drink too much.
She puke, puke, puke.
She puke, cry, puke, cry.
She's so weak.
You put on pajama, Wilmer Valderrama, top only.
Then, you make me salad, bitch.
Let's, let's get you into bed, okay?
I don't think we're doing any modeling today.
No, I have to go, Jess, I have to go.
It's my job, all right?
You know what, Cece?
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know that you're...
I know you're an intelligent person, and sometimes I just...
I just get mixed up, you know, And I think that you're like me.
Don't, don't worry, I'm here.
Just tell me where to stand and what we're selling.
I'm gonna give it everything I got.
I'm calling your agency.
This is totally unprofessional.
Don't call my agency.
Just tell me where to stand.
Up on the spinning platform.
Yeah, I can't do that.
Okay.
Please, no, seriously don't. I can't lose this job.
No.
Don't call the agency, okay?
I'll do it.
What?
I'm actually a model, too, mostly in Japan.
Um, they call me Giggle Bangs Rice Bowl.
I know you're lying and I just don't care.
Get over to hair and makeup now.
Cool.
These things are heavy.
It's like chain mail on my eyes.
So, your job is to highlight the features of the car Gary describes.
We need you to be fun and sexy and American.
Then he's gonna move to the EcoBoost engine and the new interior styling.
For the EcoBoost engine, give me something mischievous.
Mischievous.
Mischievous.
Show me mischievous.
Okay, and at the end, just say,
"Ford. Go further."
Do I have to wear those?
Hey, everybody, my name's Gary, and I want to introduce you to the all-new
2013 Ford Fusion.
Say hello to my good friend Jessica.
The all-new Fusion has been totally redesigned inside and out.
All-new styling,
18-inch aluminum wheels, three-year, bumper-to-bumper warranty, five-year power train, available Active Park, available lane-keeping system, standard voice-activated SYNC.
Your co-workers will be jealous.
From power plants that enhance efficiency the high-voltage lithium-ion battery pack provides enough power to operate in all-electric mode for short commutes... very smart.
The Ford Fusion is designed to be environmentally conscious.
Fusion Hybrid and the Fusion Energi are each powered by a combination high-voltage electric motor that utilizes... recycled material.
The Fusion is available with an EcoBoost engine...
a hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid.
The SE Hybrid is available with eco-friendly cloth seating.
No matter what color your seats... ha!... they'll be green.
Smoother rides, more fuel efficiency...
Gary...
The hybrid gets
47 miles to the gallon, so you're gonna be filling up your t*nk less.
Gary... Gary...!
When you do...
I can't get out.
Hey, man, it's your old pal Jessica.
And it's not that difficult to get out.
There's also the available auto start-stop That...
Use the handle.
What's happening?
Further, go further.
Hey.
Uh, Schmidt, I got you something, man.
Uh, they didn't have a Jewish star at the store, so I got you a regular cookie and I made the star myself by breaking off the pieces.
It's meant to celebrate your Jewish heritage.
What is this?
A Jewish star... I just said that.
Hey, hey, Schmidt, just...
This...
Is so terrible!
You gave me a cookie, I gave you a cookie.
You gave me a cookie, gave you cookie.
Gave me cookie, got you cookie!
You gave me cookie, I got you cookie, man!
Gave me cookie, got you cookie!
We're even! We're even, Schmidt!
I mean, what do you want from me?
What do you want, Schmidt?
I've been racking my brain all day.
I walked around the grocery store, man, for 45 minutes.
I didn't know what to get you.
And then I was thinking I was gonna get you ramen like we used to eat, but you probably eat, like, fancy ramen now with, like, figs in it.
I don't know, man.
You love me too much, Schmidt, and you picked the wrong guy.
And when are you gonna get that through that giant head of yours?
I'm just gonna let you down, man.
Are you crying?
I'm not crying, man.
Yeah, you are crying.
Oh, my God.
I'm not crying, guys. Just drop it.
I just felt like I did something nice.
Yes, you are, and that's okay.
Don't say that, man,
'cause that...
You know what I mean? Like...
Just let it rain, man.
I got you the cookie, Schmidt.
It's the best I can do, man.
What about the turtle?
You're the only turtle I want.
You're the turtle, man.
I knew I was the turtle.
Yeah, man, you're the turtle.
I knew I was the turtle.
You guys are the best, man. I love you guys.
I'm sorry, sorry, man.
Hey, yeah.
I'm going to, uh...
Yeah, I've got...
I'm gonna eat my sandwich.
This is a good sandwich.
See you guys.
This needed to happen.
Wow, they gave you the, the huge lashes.
Like, those are the magnums.
Yeah, I actually like 'em.
I think I'm just gonna keep 'em on.
You're afraid to take the glue off.
Yeah, I'm terrified.
I'm really sorry about what I said last night
'cause... this is hard.
It is just pointing at stuff, but it is... it's hard.
Why is it so hard?
You make it look a lot harder.
No, you're brave.
You've always been braver than me.
Okay, what did you do to me last night?
I mean, can you sprain someone's chest?
You should see the other guys.
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?
I'm so full.
This really is your best cake ever.
Do you think so?
Mm-hmm.
We all think so.
Hey, that's gross.
Get a fork, man.
I got two Perfectly good forks at the end of my arms.
Hey, man, you do what you do.
Be you, man.
I'd eat out of your hands, Nick.
Cake on your face.
Petting zoo style.
Yeah, yeah.
Cake all day.
Talkin' about cake!
Frickin' cake dudes.
Look at you.
Look at you. Frosting face.
Hey.
Want cake on your face?
I don't really care.
Do you think, if we met today, we would still be friends?
I could watch you eat cake all day.
Couple of guys eating cake.
I'm gonna have to do so much cardio tomorrow.
I don't know, but we're friends now.
Happy birthday, Cece.
Oh, man! That's messy.
You like rap music?
Yeah, sure do.
Who's your favorite rapper?
Brian Austin Green.
He's cool.
He's awesome.
Go like this.
Try to catch the Pop-Tart, you big boy.
Good, I love Pop-Tarts.
Oh!
Now close your eyes.
Did you get me?
Yeah.
Good job.
Ready?
Ready?
Yeah.
Aah, we did it!
Hey, Mr. Belvedere, there's two guys outside with a giant box, and it's got "happy birthday" written all over it.
There it is.
Hey, guys.
Pay up, gentlemen. She's sitting on the couch.
Yeah, right, you won.
Let me get a four.
Mm-hmm.
TGIF marathon tonight.
What?
I can't take this any more.
What is happening?
I've actually been working on something.
A résumé, maybe?
Did I do that?
I'm sorry. Did you just say you were working on that?
It's Urkel!
Urkel?
Urkel.
Urkel, Jess?
It's funny.
Okay, look, It is perfectly fine to watch TV all day.
No, it is not.
No, it's not.
But Urkel?!
Come on.
Not even in my darkest moments did I do Urkel.
Guys, that's crazy. This is objectively hilarious.
I can do any character from an '80s sitcom. Quiz me. - No.
Oh, Alf, don't eat the cat!
Get out of the city, Cousin Larry Appleton.
I'm Frasier Crane.
No!
Jess, the men in suits here, the professionals, would like to know what the plan is.
I'm a professional, too, pal.
You're not. Please, you work in a bar.
It's a whole different thing. I respect you. Just, please.
I don't know what the plan is, Schmidt, but I love working at the Casserole Shanty.
Today I got a locker, and in 18 months, I'm gonna roll into some sweet dental coverage.
So, yeah, my job pretty much rules.
Low on bean! Low on bean!
I'm low on bean!
I'm good on bean!
Would you like to know what I did at my job all day today?
Don't say "crushed it."
I'm gonna go with "crushed it."
Funny enough, uh, I crushed it.
I crushed it all day today, and then I crushed it some more.
And then it asked me what I was doing, and I told it that I was crushing it.
That's what I do on a daily basis, Jess.
You used to inspire me.
I mean, not specifically...
because I find teaching to be icky... but, you know, in a vague kind of
"Look at that go-getter in a...
in a brightly colored sweater"
kind of way.
What happened to the inspiring, visor-less Jess?
Hey, maybe that's her.
Hey, we just moved in across the hall.
I'm Chaz.
This is Fife, Sutton and Brorie.
What's up? Schmidt.
Any-turds, just wanted to give you a heads up that we're having some people over to hang tonight and it might get a little loud.
I like where your head is at.
We're gonna be there with bells on.
Dolla-dolla bells, y'all.
Well, it's just going to be a bunch of young people.
So...
Hi. I live here, too.
What are you names? Schmidt!
* Who's that girl? * - *Who's that girl?*
* It's Jess. *
So, when he said,
"It's just going to be a bunch of young people,"
well, he must have meant, "You,"
meaning me, fellow young person,
"You'll feel right at home.
And you two walking corpses, stay away."
You're six months younger than me, Schmidt.
You're a corpse for sure.
Behold.
This actuarial table stops at age 99.
But if you track my current trajectory, I'm clearly gonna live till I'm 123 years old, so...
Hello, robot sex.
Is this accurate?
No, no, no, Winston, I spend $49.95 a month on a subscription to an inaccurate real-time actuarial service.
Then I think I may have d*ed four years ago.
Oh, yeah? That sucks.
"African-American male, life expectancy: 67 years"?
Sounds about right.
"Minus one year if you frequently question your career choice."
Check.
"Minus one year if your chosen field offers few opportunities for advancement."
Check and double check.
I like getting older.
I feel like I'm finally aging into my personality.
Keep this crap out of my yard!
And turn that nonsense down!
They never did get that Frisbee back.
I used that Frisbee as a dish. Seriously?
I used it for pistachios in my room.
Not only am I the youngest person in this loft, I'm also the most successful.
Oh! Shut up, Schmidt.
Are you honestly measuring yourself like a little boy?
I'm sorry that you're not growing any more like me.
And apparently, I'm gonna be growing forever.
I'm like a Jewish Peter Pan. Petya Pan.
Petter Pan. Pesach Pan.
Why don't you take it down a notch before this old man takes you outside and makes you pick a switch?
I'm like Snow Leopard. You guys are like DOS.
And as your elder, Can I give you a little advice, Schmidt? Can we talk for a sec? - Sure.
Yes, yes.
'Cause you've kind of gotten under my skin A little bit.
sh**t, Gran Torino.
I'm gonna die so soon.
Do you think that the neighbors will want, like, four individual casseroles or, like, one large party-size casserole?
Yes, Jess, that's exactly what hip, trendy millennials want to eat: casserole.
Now come on, guys, just tighten up, all right?
Think young. What the hell is that smell?
It's Old Spice.
I'm smelling Old Spice?
Yeah, and yes, It has "Old" in the title, and yes, it's all over my body.
Okay, well, take it off.
I'm wearing the Spice. The Spice is cool.
It's not even a real spice, man. Take it off.
The Spice is coming back! Everybody knows it!
The guy on the horse!
You can wear any spice. Don't wear Old Spice!
Classic cologne fight.
Guys!
Shh!
Hi.
Zander and Raj went to Pate's thing, so tonight's been notched down to a "chill hang."
Cool.
I'll just put these...
Oh.
Thanks for having us.
No, can't do this.
What is up?
Have fun, kids.
Party hip-hop. What's going on, kids?
Let's party.
What are you guys doing, huh? What is that?
Is that Top g*n? Oh, look at that.
Look at Anthony Eds, the "Goose" man.
Unbelievable that he dies in a few scenes.
Goose dies?
Not cool, man.
No, it's... Look, nobody does an onscreen death like Anthony Eds.
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald men.
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald...
Hold everything.
Is that Cass Shant?
Casserole Shanty? That's where I work.
Your chicken-broccoli totally fuels my night bikes.
I'm very happy to help.
Some of my friends don't appreciate it.
No.
You're just figuring it out, just like us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I am figuring it out.
Thank you, Brorie. I am.
I'm just figuring it out, and that's okay.
What do you guys do?
I work at home. - I'm a DJ.
Well...
Was I unclear about my night bikes?
I work for a single-national corporation called Associated Strategies.
Moo...
Oh, moo...
I know. Yeah.
Totally, Fife. I get that.
Moo...
Moo...!
Right? That's a thing, right?
Yeah? Moo?
Schmidt, you don't know...
Jess.
Did I do that?
How did you just come up with that?
Where did you get that?
It just came to me.
Where did that come from?
I just thought of it.
That's how she casseroles!
What?
Hey, Nana, Pop-Pop.
You missed an unreal hang last night.
Unreal with a capital "uh."
Really?
Those kids with the found furniture and no TV because it's cool?
It's a different world over there.
A world where it's okay to only have a part-time job.
A world where it's okay that I'm still finding myself.
A world where I have not one, but two catchphrases.
$500.
How rude!
How rude!
Just take it!
They think I made those up.
There's just one tiny hitch.
It's very awkward, and I don't know how to say it...
They hate Schmidt.
So much. How did you know?
If I had a dollar for everybody I couldn't hang out with because they hated Schmidt, I'd be rich.
Like, fill my gas t*nk all the way up rich.
He was all over the map.
He spent 20 minutes talking about aioli.
Don't worry about it. I'm on it.
What do you mean, you're on it?
You're gonna prank him, aren't you? I-I knew it!
I knew it! You're gonna prank him.
Hey, can I help you? I'm really good with pranks?
You may not help with the pranks.
Why not, man? I'm the best with the pranks, man.
They call me "Prank Sinatra."
No, you call you Prank Sinatra.
Oh, come... 'Cause I am.
Winston, you're the worst at pranks in the whole world.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are!
You either go way too small...
Hey.
Let's pour a little juice near her shoe.
...Or you go way too big.
Hey, let's h*t her in the throat with a ski.
You don't have a pranking sweet spot.
Speaking of...
Are you limping?
My hip is achy.
I wonder if it's your shoes. Did you try different shoes?
I try on four different pairs of shoes with every outfit, rain or shine. You know that.
What did you do?
Well, he could try on
100 different pairs.
It's not going to matter.
The left heel is an eighth of an inch shorter on every single pair.
This is so crazy, Nick.
Oh, my God, you know what we should do?
We should take those shavings, and then sprinkle them by his car.
Let me just get this clear.
Take the little bit of dust Yeah, 'cause...
And go outside and put it near his car?
Yes.
That's not a prank.
Yes, it is.
That's just kind of littering.
His whole ride to work, Okay, you're done.
He'd be thinking, like, "What?"
So we're pranking him so he thinks while we're not around, "What?"
It's too small.
You've got to go bigger than that.
Well, anyway, I got to fill this up with pee.
Ew! Why?
So I can pour it all over Schmidt's bed and make him think he's incontinent.
That's disgusting, Nick.
Hey, sometimes up close, art is ugly.
I got an idea.
Instead of urine, we use acid.
And put it on his face!
All right?
Jess, do these pants seem long to you?
Nick picked them up from the dry cleaner for me today, and I don't know, I swear they seem longer.
I think your pants look fine.
Okay, Jess, tonight, you're obviously gonna want to follow my lead.
I don't know how to tell you this...
Um, they hate you.
That's crazy.
It is crazy... how much they hate you.
Watch. Every time you say something, they're gonna change the subject immediately.
That's how you tell if people hate you.
I'm pretty sure I know how to crush it with the kids.
Watch this.
Hey, guys.
What up, yo?
Throw your damn hands up. We hanging out tonight?
Jess, I love your hair.
It is so good today.
Yeah!
Thank you!
Flowy. - Yes.
Really curly.
What do you guys think about the length of my sideburns? It's new. Daring or gauche?
I got my plane ticket home for Easter.
Thank you for reminding me, Jess.
Yeah. No, of course.
I've got, like, a little calendar thing.
You know, I've got a great, um...
I've got a great plane ticket guy that you...
We're having another hang tonight Jess.
Got some chokes, hula hoops, sitar. You should come over.
Yeah!
Yeah, no, like, that's the best idea.
Totally.
You, too, Schmidt.
Oh, hey, I got to... I got to take this.
Ferguson? Is that you?
Yeah, t-tonight?
Well, I mean...
I made plans with...
Well, look, if that's the comptroller's time line, then...
that's the comptroller's time line.
Well, hell, yes, send a car!
Jess, do you want to hula-hoop with me all night-slash-forever?
Oh, gosh.
They hate me.
Man, I've never seen you work this hard at anything, ever.
That's because I care so much.
I set an alarm for 5:00 a.m.
so I could switch Schmidt's fiber pills with placebos.
Damn it, I want to care about something as much as you care about ruining Schmidt's life.
And where have you been all night, young lady?
Jumping around to your hippity-hop?
Taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick?
I'm actually asking... I'm not doing a thing right here.
Those guys are so much fun.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been up for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa.
No, there's no time for sleep! Guys, here's what we got to do.
We got to find the passion that we have in life, and we got to hold on to it.
You're so right.
Just like...
I can't believe I'm saying this...
just like Nick Miller.
Why, look at that.
I've never been an inspiration before.
I don't like it.
It's too much responsibility.
Ooh, ay-ay-ay.
I am cons-to-the-pizzo.
Hmm?
Constipated.
I'm constipated.
Surprising.
Here, sit down, relax, watch some TV.
What's the chair doing over here?
Just moved it.
Oh... gosh.
Turn it down, man! Turn it down!
Turn it... What?
It's too loud!
Schmidt, you're blasting the TV, you maniac!
You can hear that?
It's blasting, Schmidt! Jess is trying to sleep!
You can hear this?
Uh, yes.
Well, you know what, you were right.
They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too.
It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity, a pan-ethnic, pan-sexual hive mind, and they want nothing to do with me.
They're not that great, Schmidt.
Last night, Chaz and Sutton got in a fight.
A lovers' quarrel?
Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.
Chaz is with Fife;
Brorie's with, uh...
the other broad.
Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater.
They're poly-amorous? Damn it!
Jess, you've got to help me help them forget how old I am.
You're not old.
Then how do you explain this?
Use your legs, buddy.
Let me show you something.
Gonna hurt your back.
Look at this... I'm freaking shrinking!
I took a photo of the wall, shrunk it down, made a copy at an architect's office.
From there, it was just your basic spackle-and-silkscreen job.
I don't care, but... yay.
It's a weird life, but it's where I'm at right now.
Okay.
Jess...
this is the hardest thing I've ever had to say.
Please help me be cool.
Say that one more time.
Oh. Visor-wearing Jess, will you please help me be cool?
Okay, listen up, I got 3.5 years to live.
I can't be an assistant any more.
I don't want to die. I want to work.
Honestly, I want to work here.
But I got to follow my passion, much like a running back would want when given the ball, and in the game of life, this job is the pigskin.
And damn it, I'm in the red zone!
And in summation, I feel...
very good about what I just said.
Hopefully, you do, too.
Who wants to start an arcade f*re?
Schmidt.
What?
What are you doing? This is not the outfit we talked about.
What? Rock and roll.
You way overshot it.
Look at that. I'm being ironic.
That's not ironic;
That's just a bad pun.
And what are you doing here?
Your arms are hot, but your neck is cold?
Hey, look at me.
If you guys keep a tight core, you can... your burpees can look like this, too.
When's the Olympics? Right, guys?
I'm gonna set a PR tonight.
Well, you know, he's not... he's not...
Parkour.
Oh!
Oh!
You got beer on her, man.
Did I do that?
Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here.
Sorry. Your mom does your laundry?
Washer-dryer kind of freaks me out, you know?
It's just, like, eh...
washa-washa-washa, guh-guh, guh-guh, uh-guh-guh-guh.
On the noise.
Okay, you know what? It's fine.
I'll-I'll wash it myself.
All right.
Thank you, though.
She's so iconoclastic and modern.
And she even got our dishwasher to work.
I remember.
You know, I mean, I just... it wasn't that big a deal.
It was just... I just... I just turned it on.
There was a button that said "on."
It's weird how the dishwasher just lives under the counter.
How come there's no dish-dryer?
Or un-washer.
Oh, my God, you guys, are we the dish un-washers?
Why don't we just move to Prague?
I need to focus on my art.
You can totally focus on your art in Prague.
If we move to Prague, should I paint my nails black again?
Hey, you guys, um...
I can't hang out with you any more.
Why not?
Because...
Our entire relationship's built on a lie.
Jess, what are you talking about?
I did not make up...
"Did I do that?"
Jess, please don't...
I have to introduce you to a...
Don't do it.
Little, adorable African-American nerd.
Don't press the button. Don't...
Jess, why would you do this to us?
Who's "Steve Urclee"?
Jess, what the hell was that?
You were supposed to teach me how to be cool.
You did a terrible job. Look what I'm wearing.
You didn't listen to anything I said!
I told you to stop trying so hard.
I will never stop trying.
I don't care if I have to do a billion burpees.
That is how you crush... you never give up.
That is the difference between me and you, Jess.
Is that what you think? You think I just gave up?
Well...
I was fired, Schmidt.
Do you think I wanted to stop teaching?
That's why I liked hanging out with those kids...
'cause they weren't judging me all the time for not crushing it.
Okay...
Do you think that I want to work At the Casserole Shanty?
Do you know what the people I work with call it?
The Ass-erole Shanty.
Just don't stop teaching.
I mean, there's got to be something.
I don't know, driver's ed, CPR...
Uh...
A smile class.
My life sucks so much right now.
But at least I'm not 23.
At least I own a trash can.
At least I can legally rent a car.
At least I don't live in a loft with three other...
But you live with us.
But I live you with guys.
Jess?
We don't care if you stole your catchphrase from some low-budget Web series.
We still want to hang out.
Don't trust your government, kids.
Oh, my God, it's the old man from the stairs.
I thought he d*ed.
Let's get out of here before his robe opens.
He's gonna get his old on you! Get out while you can!
Hey, hey, Charles, The decrepit thing that just walked by, now, that is old, okay?
And you can hate him for being old, but you cannot hate me.
We don't hate you for being old.
We hate you 'cause you're a viciously unbearable ass-head.
Seriously?
That's... Come here, that's...
Get off! Ass-head!
Ass-head! Yeah!
I'm not gonna drink it all.
Guys, I... am an ass-head.
They don't hate me because I'm old.
They hate me because of my personality.
I can totally change my personality.
Congratulations, Schmidt, that is... that's weird news.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at a brand-new man.
A man who has proved so capable of talking about so little for so long...
is now the producer of his very own sports talk show.
No way!
What?!
That's right. That's right.
Yeah, baby!
It's halftime in America!
Man, that's amazing!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2:35 to 5:35 a.m.
Boom! Prime time for truckers!
That's awesome. He's got something.
Yes.
In other news, I just spent three days trying to impress people who don't own bed frames.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I spent the last three days pouring urine on a grown man's sheets.
Can you imagine how much we would get done if we just focused our energy onto something a little bit more worthwhile?
Not to mention the money we would save.
I know.
Wait, what money?
I mean, I've been running the numbers on this, but, you know, I think I spent...
you know,
$1,200 to $1,300.
What?!
on these pranks, yeah.
What?!
And I was under- budget, so...
Under-budget?
What, you think fake contact lenses are free?
They are not, sister.
Nick, you don't have that kind of money.
I know I don't.
Where are you gonna get that from?
Doesn't matter. I had to prank Schmidt.
And I did.
Holy crap.
I need a real job.
Yeah, you do.
Don't you ever prank me!
Of course. You got it.
You'll never see it coming.
This is like the end of a horror movie.
Or the beginning of a pranking movie.
There are no pranking movies.
Yet. Get out of here.
You'll never see it coming.
This prescription is blurry.
Hi, Schmidt.
Is that you in tailored, grown-up clothing?
Yeah. Mama's gonna ride this blazer all the way to a tutoring job.
Thank goodness.
I almost thought I was gonna have to loan you money.
Well, I said tutoring job, not venture capitalist.
Proud of you nonetheless.
Thanks.
What the hell?
Okay. All right, Nick, very funny.
Quite the prankster you are.
Ha!
I'm gonna h*t your ass with a ski!
Winston?
Get some.
Hey.
You're a big girl. You can watch The Walking d*ad alone.
Sam booty-called me.
Ooh, Sam, he's so hot.
I don't care. Good night.
Don't!
What?
I need your help.
I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at casual sex.
I left him in there with crayons and paper, like he's a kid in a restaurant, and I told him I had to check my fantasy football.
You don't even know what that is.
No, sir, I do not know what that is.
I panicked. Help me.
Look, you can't separate your feelings from sex?
So what? You're a girl.
I deserve to have a shorty on the side.
Okay, a shorty is not... that's the wrong use of "shorty."
Hey, I drew a cat.
Sorry, man.
She's, uh, checking her fantasy football 'cause she...
Yeah, I'm not gonna do this, so I-I don't even...
? Who's that girl? ?
?Who's that girl? ?
? It's Jess. ?
Are we gonna talk about it?
Talk about what, Winston?
The belt, Schmidt. Please explain the belt.
It's after Labor Day. I'm wearing whales.
The dumbest thing ever.
You look like the bad guy in an '80s high school movie.
I'll have you guys know that Kanye wore this belt, okay?
Let me just say that word one more time: Kanye.
Kanye?
Yeah, and he looked beautiful in it.
His whole midsection lit up.
What is your obsession with Kanye?
Befriending Kanye is the most efficient way for me to jump social strata.
Now all I have to do is meet him, and then dazzle him to the point that we're each other's last call before bed.
"Yo, what up, K?
"Yeah, I'm just going to sleep.
"You watching Fallon?
"That brother's crazy."
Hey, Tagg Romney.
You know if your dad's gonna win the election?
: He does look like a Romney.
Telling me that I look like one of the most handsome men in politics does not hurt my feelings, Winston.
Last night was horrible.
Sam came over, we tried to make out, I stopped it, and then we just laid there like two old couple in The Notebook waiting to die.
Jess, I get it... you're the type of person that...
you need to ease into these kind of things.
Let us take you out tonight, okay?
And that way, you... you can feel like, you know, you're going on a date first.
Yes! Like we're all dating in a large, nonsexual friend group.
My nightmare. Have fun. I'm out.
Come on, Nick. Please?
Why are you doing this, Jess?
Why don't you just date a guy that...
I don't know... you like?
This is good for me.
I always jump into relationships.
Plus, Sam's not the kind of guy you spend Saturdays in your sweatpants with.
He's the kind of guy...
You bone.
I can't help. I'm at a crucial point in my zombie novel.
You selfish bastard.
I'm not a selfish bastard.
I just have to... I have to get through...
You're a selfish bastard.
I'm so sick of this zombie novel nonsense.
Not nonsense.
Friends help friends have meaningless sex, okay?
Now, you're going.
End of story.
You got it.
Where are you, Schmidt? This place is fancy, and I don't know which fork to k*ll myself with.
I got to bail! Kanye's at this club tonight.
What are you talking about? This was your idea.
Can't miss this, Nick. I got the belt on.
I took Winston with me to prove that I can be friends with black people, even oddly shaped ones.
Just shut up, Schmidt!
Shut up! This is ridiculous.
I'm leaving right now. Good-bye.
Whoa.
Wow. I forgot what you look like when you're not dressed like the Loft Troll.
Pardon?
Sorry, I didn't...
What I mean to say is you look va-va-va-vavooms!
Hello, nurse!
Hubba-bubba! Meow! Zing! You can stop me at any time.
Are the guys coming, or...?
No.
It's just us... they bailed... so if you want to go back to the loft, or we can both go back to the loft.
We're already here.
But we're already here, so...
Can I get you a chair, milady?
So weird.
Yeah.
Loft Troll not used to fancy gentleman!
Shut up.
That was so loud.
Why are you yelling?
On the list.
Winston! You've been staring at this girl for five minutes.
I hope you're checking her out.
Otherwise, you're a serial k*ller, which would explain a lot.
No. Checking her out?
No, dude, I'm in a relationship.
I know.
Like, happily. Shelby, we're...
Shelby and I haven't had sex in three weeks.
For real?
We're in a bit of a rut.
Not now. I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm cheating on Shelby.
What?
No, no, in my mind.
In your mind...?
I'm cheating on Shelby in my mind, man.
So what? So what?
What do you mean, "So what?"
I'm doing it all the time.
Like, I'm doing it a lot. I can't control myself, man.
Listen, everybody does it every minute all the time.
How do you think I get through the day, man?
Okay. Wow.
Um, in that case...
Hey, lady, can I introduce you to...
this lady?
This place is crazy expensive.
Schmidt picked it.
I can afford the valet charge and the "Add onions."
Then you'll be happy to meet my little Scottish friend.
You unexpected genius.
Is that whiskey?
White wine.
White wine?!
Why would you do wine?
Nope.
All right, my man.
Not gonna happen.
Schmidt?
It's the belt, man.
Take off the belt.
Okay, the only thing I know in this world is this belt is amazing.
Look, if you're gonna wear that thing, just...
just make it work for us, okay?
You got a plan?
Yeah, I got a plan, of course.
All right, go talk to your peeps.
It's not my peeps.
It's your peeps, man. Go talk to them.
Don't say... don't do this.
Yeah, man, come on.
I mean, come on. Really?
Yeah, word.
We got Tagg Romney out here.
We're gonna need you to sweep the the perimeter.
What the hell you talking about?
Tagg Romney. Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Romney. Like, Mitt Romney's your dad?
Let's get America back to work.
Here's the thermos.
Thanks.
You know, the drunker you get, the more obvious you're being with the thermos.
"Thermose?" "Thermas?"
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
What's a "thermoos?"
That one right there in your hand.
The "thermase?"
This is fun.
This is really fun.
It's Sam.
He's done with work, and he wants to "hang out."
He's got a job, too? Poke a hole in that condom.
Thank you, Nick.
I now feel ready to have meaningless sex.
I do what I can, so...
Hey, do you need money for the...?
Half the soup? No, I think I got it.
Loft Troll eats fancy soup.
Get out of here, would you?
Go have fun.
Excuse me.
Can I get an ice bucket for this bad boy?
And more than your normal amount
'cause this is a thermos, so...
I see what we're doing here.
We're stalking your ex-girlfriend.
Is Cece here?
Schmidt.
Cece, what up?
So, where's, uh, Blobby?
Where's... where's Blobby? Where's that dude?
You mean my boyfriend? His name's Robby.
Excuse me. My friend is too embarrassed to come over here, but she said she heard from someone in line that you're a Romney.
I am...
She's right over there.
Yeah, I'm a Romney.
Hell, yeah, I'm a Romney.
Come on!
Security, remove the thr*at. Remove the thr*at. Code red.
Is that how bad it is?
Right this way, ma'am. Come on!
Hey, that woman is stupid enough to believe...
Remove the obstruction, please. Code red. Code red.
Winston, I thought you were better than this.
I'm so sorry.
I am a huge supporter.
In '08, I was the national cochair of Kappas for Romney.
You caught me. I'm a Romney.
I'm trying to be incognito, so just...
You're... Tagg?
Tugg.
Tugg?
Tugg Romney, yeah.
I'm Tugg Romney.
Tagg's everywhere. Too much Tagg for me.
Tugg.
Whoo! What a night.
What a crazy night.
Yeah, me, too. I found a dollar on my way out of the restaurant. I used it to buy a slice of pizza.
One day closer to death!
Winston, what is wrong with you?
No. Nothing wrong with me, girl. I'm just brushing my hair.
I just want to say that I had meaningless, wonderful sex last night with Sam.
And that sex would not have been possible without the efforts of a one Nick Miller.
But okay.
I don't want to kiss and tell, but he did ruin my dresser during intercourse.
Come on! Why are you saying that?
Will you go to Ikea with me?
Sure, I'm not doing anything.
But don't let me lay my eyes on the Malm collection.
I can't afford it, and I'm a sucker for it every time.
I'll go get my golf pencils.
Mm-hmm.
If you got something to say, my man, just say it.
Hey, look, a man can only sit back and observe but for so long before he has to speak his mind.
Then speak your mind.
A line has been crossed, all right?
You, my friend, have become her fluffer.
Like in p*rn?
An emotional fluffer.
I'm an emotional fluffer?
You got to set some boundaries, all right?
You're gonna start fulfilling ever single need of hers, all right?
Doing all the things that a boyfriend would do...
Winston...for some other dude who ain't doing nothing.
And I'm her friend.
You're her boyfriend.
No, I'm not her boyfriend.
You're a boyfriend without the rewards.
How about this? Why don't you just shut up?
Hey, Nick, you ready?
Yeah.
So it's not available at the closest Ikea, but it is available at the second-closest Ikea, which is about 45 minutes...
if we could drive over the reservoir.
But we can't, so...
it's about an hour and a half.
Cool.
I had so much sex last night.
Fluffer.
You're gonna get caught.
Impossible.
I've been studying Romney trivia all day long.
Memorizing Dad's gestures so I can mimic him.
You're calling Mitt Romney "Dad"
now? That's where we're at?
Mm-hmm.
Schmidt, we get it.
He's the dad you never had.
Okay, all-knowing Indian god Ganesha, this is about sex.
You know they have Romney Olympics every summer at the lake house?
I bet that's a hoot. I'm sure it's like the real Olympics, only the white people win the sprints.
Okay, so you good?
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, Nick, any chance you understand how to put this together?
I think it looks pretty easy, actually.
No, you know, I'm actually busy. I'm, uh...
I'm moving money around.
I'm-I'm diversifying. I've got...
And I'm not your fluffer, by the way.
What's a fluffer?
In p*rn, it's the person who keeps the actor...
motivated, aroused, you know?
Ew! That's a job?
And that's what I am. I'm your emotional fluffer.
I'm there whenever you need a guy.
You want a cup of tea, I'll make it.
You lose your phone, I'll call.
You're my friend. That's what friends do.
I'm you boyfriend without the rewards.
Yeah.
You're saying you want the...?
No! No, no, no, no, no. Not with you. Blecch!
Don't say "blecch!"
I don't want it.
I'm not disgusting. It's not an unheard of thought.
Blecch!
Come on. Admit it, you've thought about it.
You and me, sexually? Nope.
Blecch! Never thought about it once.
Don't lie.
Not on purpose.
Sleeping Nick is a totally different guy.
You know you did when you walked in on me doing deep lunges.
Yeah, check my Google history, Jess.
It's filled with girls doing deep lunges.
I mean, I'll admit I've thought about it.
Yeah.
When was this?
Last year. Just once.
Would you like to eat me?
What do you mean? Aren't you a little small?
What, are you nuts?!
What happened?
Why am I doing this?
That's what does it for you?
Yeah, I thought about it for five minutes, and then I realized it would never, ever work between us.
Yeah, I agree. That's how I see it.
Great. I'm glad we agree on something.
Me, too!
Great.
Out of curiosity, why do you think that, though?
Because you drive me nuts, Miller!
Because you're always sighing, like you're the president of the United States and you have to decide whether we're going to w*r or not.
I sigh because you sing about everything.
I do not.
? And I hate it. ?
? You sing and dance about nothing. ?
You're cheap!
You are so cheap.
I'm not cheap.
You never, ever put money in any tip jar, ever.
What are you talking about?
I've never seen you ever do that.
Last week, when we went to the coffee shop.
You put nickels in the tip jar!
You know what a jar is in my business?
Nickels! Nickels are worse than no money; it's an insult.
It's just a little boy saying, "Love me!"
"Give me attention!"
You're a bartender.
You live on tips. You should know better.
The nickel?
The only American currency...
You can't not give someone a tip Because you don't like tip jars!
...graced with the face of Thomas Jefferson.
Well, I think that's rude, Nick!
I didn't realize you were on the fence about the Louisiana Purchase...
You hate everything!
...Jessica!
And I could never live with that.
I barely live with it now!
But you need me to have sex.
That's what you think?
I'm calling Sam, and we're gonna go on a date.
And we're gonna talk our faces off.
Okay?
Good luck. Good luck with that.
Can't find your phone, Jess?
No, I'll find it.
'Cause I'm not calling you this time.
Are you happy now?
Now I have to get to know the guy I'm sleeping with.
That was a pocket dial!
That was an ill-timed pocket dial!
I will not explain myself!
I just wish I had a lot more solo Tugg time.
You know?
Well, you can be Tugg with me.
Sometimes I think that I'm just a riddle that, well, even I can't solve.
Yeah, see? I tried to solve it again.
Hi.
Hi.
I hope it's okay, I invited over some of the Kappas For Romney.
Kappas For Romney!
Courtney.
Such a pleasure. - Courtney.
I'm April.
April.
They just got so excited when I said I met one of the Romney boys.
No, who wouldn't be?
Did you ask him?
I think April's in love with your brothers.
Who isn't?
Who's the shy one?
Who's the joker? Who's tried coffee?
April, you're such a spaz.
Yeah, no, nobody gets rowdy like us Romney boys.
Just a bunch of alphas, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
That is, of course, unless we're fishing on Lake Winnipesauke.
There's nothing that I love more than just getting out on the water with Dad, the freezing cold dawn, a couple of cold beers in hand.
Having that one quick moment...
Your dad doesn't drink. He's a Mormon.
Well, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.
You know, we just buy them to support American breweries.
Then we dump them in the lake.
'Cause we're Americans.
So... um...
I want a casual sex affair, just like in the movies.
Nice.
But it turns out...
I need some conversation first.
So...
If you want to hang...
No.
...Hang out more...
I don't...
I don't want to hang out more.
Okay.
Because, if I hang out with you, it's just the truth, I'm gonna fall in love with you.
It's just how I am. I can't separate things out.
Question:
Under what circumstances would you build a dresser for a woman?
And this is, like...
and I'm not interested in sleeping with her?
Um...
Am I being blackmailed?
No.
Is it like a...
it's like a Make-A-Wish Foundation type thing?
No.
I mean... Yeah. Marriage.
You know, anything besides marriage is a...
you know, an abuse.
An abuse?
Yeah, you can't do that to a friend.
Unless your friend's a chump.
Or a certified carpenter... that would work.
Wait a minute. This isn't a sex thing, is it?
Because I... you know, I can't pleasure a woman and build a dresser at the same time, you know?
I'm not God.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, what's going on, man?
Are you going to the dark place?
I'm not going to the dark place, okay?
I did what you said, I told her I didn't want to be her fluffer, and it went great.
Then what is wrong with you? Get up, man.
Look, I did what you said, and I feel terrible.
Because you didn't set boundaries.
I don't know what that means, Winston.
As a friend, you can lift a heavy object, but you can't drive her to the airport, okay?
You can hold the elevator, but only if you see her running down the hallway saying, "Hey, man, please can you hold the elevator?"
No picnics, no mini-muffins and never Adele.
Adele?
Never Adele.
Adele's amazing.
No Adele.
No concerts, no music, no T-shirts, no nothing.
But guys and girls...
Never Adele!
A little Adele.
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Nick! You're gonna calm down, okay?
You want my help or what, man?
Yes.
Don't be so intense.
Most importantly...
you will not build her that dresser.
It's furniture.
It implies that one day, you will share it with her.
And that's not gonna happen.
You're right. You're right.
Are-are you spelling it right?
Two "G"s, silent "B."
Here's a picture of the whole family.
And you are not in it.
Yeah, well, somebody had to take the picture, Megan.
Just admit it. You're not a Romney.
I'm not a Romney? Would a non-Romney know this?
That Ma and Pa never go to bed angry.
That there are 16 grandchildren, Allie, Joe, Thomas, Gracie, Wyatt, Parker, Miles, Jonathan, Sawyer, Nate, Nash, Mia, Owen, Soleil, Nick and Chloe.
Those are just facts you got from the Internet.
I'm proud to be a Romney.
Okay? I'm proud to have had a dad that was around when I was growing up.
A dad that took me camping, a dad that spent Saturdays with me, throwing... throwing the football.
A dad that gave me a wink when I left for prom night and said, "Be safe, son."
When I think of a dad like that, I'm proud not only of the Romney name, but of this country.
God bless Mitt Romney.
God bless America.
It's a candid sh*t from the governor's biography.
The caption says,
"The whole family."
Nitpicking turns me off.
You're all horribly unattractive to me.
Tugg Romney, out.
Hey.
I got your text.
When you're going through a Taylor Swift-like range of emotions, I should come over, right?
You were the only one that I could talk to.
Being brown, you have the wisdom of 1,000 white women.
All right.
What happened with that girl?
Winston.
Winston.
Hey.
Are you serious right now?
Well, I...
He-he said it was okay.
She is off limits.
Go call your girlfriend.
You obviously have things you need to work out.
Fine. Fine.
But for the record, it was loving and tender and you squeezed my hand at the end.
Get out of here!
Deviant.
Okay, so...
tell me what happened.
Well, I'm back to being Schmidt.
I'm gonna miss it, though.
Being a Romney.
Schmidt, your life would not have been better if you were a Romney.
Cece, look, my dad left when I was eight.
Okay?
And then he went and had three kids with his new wife, and me and my mom were just these two weirdos who belonged to nobody.
Until she started spending all this time with this woman from work who...
who she still lives with today.
Schmidt.
He's your dad. All right?
Find a way to forgive him for not being a presidential candidate with great hair.
Forget it.
No one understands.
There, I thought you needed that, okay?
Just take a breath, and it will...
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's like memory foam.
Call your dad.
You've been cheating on me in your mind?
Yes, but, like, to be fair, you were there.
A lot of times, you would just pop up mad, but you were there.
Winston, come on, it's fine. Look, you can think about whatever you want to think about.
I know I'm the one you want to be with.
Come on, want to come upstairs and watch some SVU?
You want to watch SVU right now?
Well, I'm too wound up to watch Raymond.
Look, sometimes after a big fight, I like to cool off with some TV.
What do you mean, big fight?
We just had a fight.
We hardly talked.
Like, I want to talk, I want to fight, I want to do something!
Well, maybe we can fight in your mind.
Hey.
Stop.
Jess...
Stop. Do not... Come on, Nick.
Don't build that dresser, please.
Jess, it's fine. I have another one.
I need, like, three to build this thing.
I can't let you fluff me.
I can't let you work in emotional p*rn.
You have too much to offer.
Forget it, Jess.
I'm building you the dresser.
I love this stuff.
It's like high-stakes Legos.
Okay, but...
I didn't know what I was doing to you.
I've always had relationships in different boxes.
Friends in one box, boyfriends in another.
But now...
it's messy, and...
I don't want to screw up what I have with you.
You're too important to me.
It's different with us.
We're just two people who want to be friends, but are sometimes attracted to each other.
Ha!
No, no...
You have thought about the reward.
That's not what I said.
My calculations were correct.
I love deep lunges.
Just don't make a big deal of it.
I just don't need a bunch of people telling me what we can and can't do together.
That pisses me off.
If I want to build you a dresser, I'm gonna build you a damn dresser.
But if you want to have dates before sex, just do me a favor and have them with the guy you're having sex with.
Agreed.
Good.
Maybe I should just stop trying with Sam.
I'm old-fashioned below the belt.
I've got a Civil w*r-era piece of equipment, and that's all she wrote.
All right.
I got to give you something now.
Something... really close to my heart.
That's Nick's Sexy Mix.
AKA the original fluffer.
"The Humpty Dance"
does it for you, Nick?
Do your thing, girl.
Get crazy.
When we're done, I want you to immediately turn this off.
Yes.
Ooh...
Well, it took a year, she's finally cooking and cleaning.
I knew this would pay off eventually.
Does everybody like egg pie?
Jess, I believe the word that you're looking for is "frittata."
Oh, Schmidt, stop staring at my fritta-tas! (laughs)
You gotta do something, Nick.
My sister's coming, my mother's coming.
I love being unemployed. I love it!
If I'd lost my job a week ago, I'd be deep in a p*rn hole by now.
Five-second rule.
The images, the things I would have seen by now. It's...
Jess, are you cooking a frittata in a saucepan? What is this, prison?
Jar.
Jar. That's a jar for sure.
Yeah, I know.
I already got the money ready.
No!
What? Oh, no!
SCHMIDT: Damn it!
No!
Jess! What is this?!
I just finished that last night. Isn't it great?
SCHMIDT:
Felt art?
Nick?
I'm on it.
What?
What photograph were you working from? My hair hasn't looked like that in three weeks.
Your hair looks just like that, Schmidt.
Yeah, your hair looks just like that.
You are perfect in that.
This is making me furious.
It's multi-cloth collage.
Insane!
Jess, can I have a word with you?
Take a break!
You're looking at this the wrong way.
This is the first time you don't have to be anywhere or do anything.
Right.
You could make weird art or don't make weird art.
But the point is you can do whatever you want.
You could go off the grid. You could be an outlaw.
I'm not really someone who goes off the grid, Nick.
Whoo-hoo! I'm off the grid!
I'm so far off the grid, that everybody's all, "She's off the grid!"
And then I'm all,
"I don't play by your rules."
I can drink at 11:00... a.m.
Yeah, that backfired pretty quickly.
High five.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪Who's that girl?♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
Look at that, look at that, look at that.
My mom always said I was a late bloomer.
Wait till she sees this mustache! Bam!
That's not a shadow?
What?
'Cause your nose makes a shadow right over your...
Oh, now it is a mustache. You look adorable.
Winston, I need you to be honest with me, okay?
Yeah.
Does your mother not like me?
Yes.
She does, she does not like me?
Schmidt, she loves you.
Good, good, because, you know, historically speaking, I'm like, catnip to tough-talking African-American women.
It's 'cause I don't front, know what I mean?
Don't do that.
A'ight.
What is that?
What's your name?
I'm Nick.
Nick's name is Nick!
Nick, meet Nick.
Hi, Nick.
You guys even look alike.
Look at that turtle face.
Nick, want these kegs behind the bar?
Yes.
Yes.
He was talking to me.
He was talking to you.
NICK: Andy, I'll go get your check, bud.
Oh, hey, Winston, you know, you can just have the hummus in there, okay? It's giving me the toots.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, Alisha.
You look great. Wow.
Thanks.
It's like they stretched the ugly out of Winston.
Hmm.
How's the hoops?
Good, it's good.
Yeah?
Very impressive, pro ball.
I mean, women's pro, but still. Swoosh.
I was working in real estate, but I got laid off, so...
I got laid off last week!
I don't even know what to do with myself.
I just told myself it was a chance to start over.
Yes.
Be someone That I've always wanted to be, you know?
I'm Jess.
Hi. How are ya?
I'm Bearclaw!
Bearclaw helps me with the deliveries.
Hey.
Here's your check, my man.
Thanks, man.
Maybe I'll see you around. I'm in the phone booth.
Um, oh, it was nice to meet you, Jess.
Nice meeting you, too.
And, Jess, you met me.
Nice to meet you both.
Hey, Nick, I know what I'm gonna do with all my free time.
Him.
You like him?
Mother, may I? Can you give him my phone number?
Yeah, absolutely.
(purrs)
Winston, your sister got so hot.
I'm gonna have to Shaq att*ck her.
Schmidt.
May I have your blessing? 'Cause I'm gonna be, Like, dribbling up the court.
Schmidt.
Boom. Technical foul.
Boom. Illegal use of the hands. Boom.
Hello, Schmidt.
Charmaine.
Charmaine!
The loft just became Big Mama's House!
Give me a hug.
You gonna take care of this?
He's d*ad to me.
Okay.
Hi. Excuse me. Are you Katie?
I'm Sam from Cupid Match.
And I'm the girl from my dreams of you.
You are Katie, right?
Yeah.
Finally.
I am. I'm Katie. Hi.
Hi. So many e-mails back and forth.
How's the little dog of yours?
I had to put her-im down on the way here.
Oh, my God!
I know.
Can I tell you something?
Uh, not really.
I'm you from the future.
Well, that's a first.
Nick, I traveled from the future to find you.
I'm a time traveler.
Does everybody tip badly in the future, or is it just you?
You don't believe I'm you, do you?
Absolutely not.
Well, I know you didn't shower this morning.
Well, good guess. It's a Wednesday.
I know a girl broke your heart and you gave up on love.
I know sometimes you get mad and you don't know why.
I know you're a bartender because you like three feet of bar between you and everyone you meet.
Well, I mean...
Chew on that, you clown.
Wait. Hey, don't-don't say all that weird stuff and then just leave!
You were wrong about the bar!
But everything else was right.
What was the band that we...? I know...
I'm in.
I've been to
48 Creed shows, so...
Forty-two.
No way!
Way!
Are you serious?
Wow!
Way to go, Cupid Match.
Yeah. Hey, hold still.
You got a little hair...
on your nose.
(mouthing)
Let's just say, hypothetically, we live in a world where time travel exists, okay?
So if that is the case...
One, Marie Antoinette. Two, Cleopatra.
Three, young Ann-Margret.
Four, old Ann-Margret.
Would you shut up, you clown?! I'm being serious!
I'm talking about real time travel here, Schmidty.
And I made an astute observation off of that.
I might have met future me.
Who knows about this?
Nobody. You're the first person I've told, obviously.
Whoa.
If I find out how you die, Do you want me to tell you?
Don't worry. I already know. It's one of these moles.
See this little S.O.B. right there?
That's the guy?
I've been eyeing him for a while.
That's one's gonna turn green one day, and then (snaps fingers)
there you go.
Schmidt's d*ad.
I met me in my bar!
Ask him when I meet Kanye.
'Cause I vision...
I'm talking about real time travel.
I have visions of me, Kanye, Beyoncé...
I could figure out what happened...!
Hey, can I talk to you guys?
What's up, baby?
Don't call me baby. Seriously, stop.
Come on, spill. - Don't wink at me.
What?
Okay, look, I had the best sex of my life last night.
He brewed me like a fine chamomile.
Oh, so that was you.
I thought that was a couple bums fighting.
It wasn't.. It was me having sex.
Mm. - I left my body, went up to heaven, saw my grandparents, Thought it was weird that I saw my grandparents, came back down, I became a werewolf, I scared some teenagers.
I came back into my body. Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie.
And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets.
SAM:
Katie?
KATIE:
Hey, Sam.
These are my roommates.
Hey.
Hey, uh, Katie, we're running late for dance rehearsal.
Yes. Oh.
We're wondering if we're doing leg warmers today...
Leg warmers.
Oh, we are. Leg warmers?
You guys are dancers, too?
Yeah, I mean, mostly Katie, Yes, yes.
But yeah.
What, do we not look like dancers?
No, I mean...
This one's a leaper.
No, I knew he was gonna go there.
You're a leaper. You are.
Yep. He is. They call him, uh, Cricket.
Yeah, Cricket the leaper.
Let me see you leap.
Cricket, show him how you leap.
I'd love to see you leap.
Don't get self-conscious now. You've got this.
You've got it.
You're really getting a show here,
'cause he normally doesn't do this for a private audience.
Do the tribal stuff.
All right. Yeah.
SCHMIDT: Beautiful.
SAM: Is he okay?
I'm kind of hearing some popping.
SCHMIDT:
No, no, Look at that vert.
Breathtaking.
Faster. Faster.
SCHMIDT:
Grasshopper.
And I'm done.
All right, you know what? I'm gonna go to a couple brunches, maybe take a nap, rehydrate. Come here.
(grunts)
NICK:
This is so normal.
This isn't upsetting at all.
Yah!
(laughs)
Oh, man.
All right, I'm gonna text you later.
Yep.
And if you find my underwear just, uh...
keep it.
(whispers):
I got to go.
SCHMIDT:
Wow, Katie's an animal.
Katie's the best.
Nice.
I love being Katie.
Vintage Katie.
Like an animal you are.
Katie knows how the sausage gets made.
Ew.
Katie...
Has a job, y'all.
I think I should just stay Katie.
Maybe you should watch a cautionary tale that I like to call The Nutty Professor.
What's Katie gonna do, Nick?
She's got some pretty dark needs.
Well, I hope you don't like him,
'cause you're not coming back from, "Just kidding. My name is actually Jess."
(phone chimes)
"Hey, I got your number from Nick. Want to hang?"
What's this?
I gave your number To the guy that you like from the bar. You asked me to.
Oh, my God.
I forgot.
I've never had two guys into me before.
What's happening?
Jess, I'm gonna tell you what's happening.
Okay, there comes a time in every person's life when... for no reason whatsoever they are irresistible to the opposite sex.
For me, it was the third night of Hanukkah '96, which I like to refer to as The Night of the Shoshannas.
For me, it's every time I Jet Ski.
This is not fair.
It is gonna take all of my game to sleep with Winston's sister.
What?
What?
And then there's you, Who has this raw animal magnetism just dropped in her lap like a sack of taters. What a waste.
I'm pretty sure it is not a waste.
Oh, it's a waste.
Jess, look, you don't have the skill to juggle men.
You wear a cardigan on top of another cardigan.
We all know you're not the best with doorknobs.
You can barely hold one thing in each hand.
You tripped the other day just standing there.
What's happening?
Okay, but Katie can juggle men.
She's out the door before you even know your wallet's gone, son.
(phone chimes)
Ooh.
He wants to cook for me.
Is there a hot way of saying I don't feel sexy after I've had a lot of cheese?
I would say no.
WINSTON (whistles):
Didn't know this was a butter Kn*fe type of place.
Don't worry, the team's paying.
If anybody asks, you're the ball boy.
Hey, Coach, put me in.
Schmidt.
Schmidt, what the hell are you doing here?
Come on, move over. Hey, y'all.
Everybody scooch, a little scoochie down.
Okay, teamwork. Defense.
Really?
A lot of money that I want to deposit into your Tyra Banks.
If he touches your sister, I'm gonna stop paying your cell phone bill.
The L.A. Sparks.
So many Sparks in one place, you're about to start the world's sexiest f*re.
Am I right?
JESS:
Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts.
Come to the professor. Let me see.
He says, "Can't stop thinking"
about what you're gonna wear tonight."
How do I respond?
With a simple...
Mm-hmm.
"Or not wear."
Okay.
Okay?
"Or not wear because sex happens naked."
Send.
Okay, let me help you with that.
"Just kidding.
Get ready for a night you will never forget."
Okay?
"Because once you see my body, you will go brain-d*ad and have memory loss."
Send.
Oh, no.
Autocorrect changed "body"
to "meat bar."
(knocking on door)
Bearclaw, what are you...
Yeah!
Oh, you're so hot.
Come here.
(sighs, whispers): I can't wait to see your meat bar.
That's why they call me Bearclaw.
You did that yourself in middle school.
See now it's retracting its claws.
Now it's contracting its claws.
Like, "Rrr, I'm gonna att*ck you in the wild."
(phone rings)
Oh, my God, phone's ringing.
Oh.
Got to take this.
I'm so sorry, it...
No, no, no, I...
It's very important.
I'll just be cooking.
I love cooking.
It's my only outlet.
Nick, Nick.
You gave my number to the wrong guy.
Wait, which one did you want me to give your number to?
Andy.
Andy is so boring.
Bearclaw just told me a ten minute joke about squirrels with the punch line,
"eat these nuts."
Seriously, he is so awesome.
Nick, I don't want to hurt his feelings.
Tell me what to do because you got me into this mess; this is your fault.
This is not my fault. I just wanted you to stop cleaning the kitchen so much, Jess.
(phone chimes)
Oh, my God.
Who's Katie?
I'm Katie.
What is happening?
Hey, mama bear.
Hey.
Yeah.
Can I tell you some... thing?
Me first.
Um, when Nick...
When Nick told me that you wanted my number, I was all like...
(bellows)
And then I was like, Nick, this might be the best thing that ever happened to me.
Now you go.
Um...
what I was gonna say was, um...
You're...
an old soul.
Hey, I wanted...
I wanted to tell you.
When I, uh, I got your text from before, and I have figured out my sex character.
And it's Sergeant Giddyap Carruthers.
Hey, if we... if we make love later, and I tell you to pretend that I'm a scary ghost, are you gonna be weirded out by that?
Bearclaw, I'm sick.
Oh.
In my... face.
Oh, no, um, I've got an a**l thermometer in my bag.
I'm really good at telling myself, and I think that I'm... I feel very feverish.
I don't think I need the thermometer.
Oh, yeah.
No, you do feel hot.
Yeah.
Now you feel even hotter.
Alisha, have a drink with me.
Schmidt, I only go out with guys who play basketball.
Well, let's play for it.
I win, you have a drink with me.
You win, I take you to brunch.
sh**t me.
Schmidt, I'm a professional basketball player.
Yeah, and I'm a guy who works in marketing that wants to give it to you.
We both have jobs;
Get over it.
Do I ever finish writing my zombie book?
Z is for Zombie?
Great title.
Do we ever get rich and famous?
Three words:
Hot, air, balloon.
Do we invent them?
No, they've been invented.
Jess or Katie?
Not now, Nicks.
Hey, tell her you're sorry.
What for?
You'll find out.
I mean, I'm sure I did something stupid, but what did I do?
You just tell her you're sorry.
What did I do?
You did something stupid.
So tell her you're sorry.
Now I know why people get annoyed with me.
It's hard to talk to us.
Hey, you know, I can't believe she asked Nick for your number and then...
Yeah, yeah, you know what, man?
We-We're perfect together.
It's like I finally found my lady bear.
See, I felt like we had a connection, too.
You know, I don't know if you ever get that feeling like, I don't know, like maybe I could marry this woman.
Oh, God.
(gasps)
Is there a woman in that bathroom being harmed?
No.
I don't buy it. Get out of the way.
I was trained for this.
Now you're gonna get the Bearcl...
Jess?
Hi, Bearclaw.
I thought you were sick.
I'm feeling better.
Why are you... if you're sick, why are nothing but your breasts covered, Jess?
Are you a doctor, is that why?
Are you a doc... is he a doctor?
Do you know these guys, Katie?
ANDY: Who's Katie?
What is going on in... Jess?
No, Nick.
I... Katie?
What is happening?!
Liar! You...
Liar!
I'm sorry, Bearclaw, but I meant Nick to give my number to Andy.
Silver lining, you have a huge fan in Nick.
She's not good enough for you, Bearclaw.
None of these people are good enough for you.
And, Sam, I'm sorry I stole you from real Katie, but ugh, look at you.
He's so handsome.
Very handsome.
I'm only human.
You know what, Bearclaw?
I would have take you to the bathroom, big guy.
He would've.
You guys are terrible people.
I want to die.
SAM: Hey, hold on a second.
Everyone just calm down. Are you really a dancer?
Are you an idiot, Sam?
JESS: Yes!
Did I tell a lie? I did.
But in my defense, I'm off the grid.
We're all off the grid. Hey, hey, we are all off the grid.
Every single one of us, especially you, handsome.
I loved you!
I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration.
You're gonna tell him how he feels after everything you've just done?
Why don't you shut up, Andy?
Yeah, shut up, Andy.
What is this, recess? Come on.
Shut up. - Shut up.
Shut up, Andy!
Nick.
It's time.
Good-bye.
No, no, Nick.
Old Nick, don't go!
(door closes)
Nick!
Nick, wait.
Please.
There's so much more I need to ask you.
I got to get back.
Why do I need to apologize to Jess?
What did I do wrong?
Make her an old-fashioned.
(chuckles)
Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.
Beep, boop, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Beep, beep, boop, beep, ba, ba, ba, beep.
(groans)
Beep, beep, boop, boop, boo.
(rolls tongue)
I believed you.
Olde England.
Have a good trip, man.
When I was a kid, Yeah.
Watching MTV, I thought that if I played my cards right, I could grow up to be Jenny McCarthy.
Jenny McCarthy? You?
Don't make that face.
She was so beautiful with all that swearing, but you know what?
I'm not Jenny McCarthy.
I know that now.
I'm back on the grid, Nick.
You know, I always wanted to be Kurt Loder.
Kurt Loder? He never even went to the Spring Break House. He was stuck in New York, talking to Pearl Jam.
He is the elder statesman of our generation.
Why are you making me a drink? You never bring work home.
All right, this is gonna sound really weird, but in the future I might do something really bad to you, and I hope you'll forgive me.
Do you like old-fashioneds, Jess?
I've actually always wanted to try one.
How did you know?
(knocking on door)
What are you gonna do to me?
I don't know.
But it could be bad.
Like me getting drunk and peeing in your closet on all your pretty dresses.
(laughs)
I forgive you.
(knocking resumes)
Imagine all that pee on your pretty dresses, Jess.
I still forgive you.
Hey.
Sam, hi.
Katie?
Not Katie.
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry to come over here unannounced.
I didn't... I just wanted to tell you that I don't... I don't care that you lied to me.
I lied, too. Half my profile is a lie.
I am not a shy food blogger who wants a destination wedding in Scotland, okay?
I don't open up the more you get to know me.
I mean, I, you know, Internet date so I don't have to sleep with people I work with.
I do like Creed, though.
I hate Creed.
I don't care what you like or what your name is, or... anything about you.
And the good news is you don't have to care about me either.
And we can still tear each other apart.
What do you think?
You know what?
I'm gonna say yes, I think.
Yeah, let's do this.
Um...
Do we start now or later or now?
Congratulations. I see you've met the one.

Ugh, Jess, would you please scratch an itch I have on my undercarriage?
I can't get the right angle and Winston refuses.
No, I don't have time, Schmidt.
Jess, please, I-I ... this is awful.
I feel like I dropped something in there.
You hear that? Loose change.
I thought we talked about you not wearing your shower diaper in the kitchen.
Excuse me, do you think this has been easy for me ...
to wash myself all summer long with a penis cast on?
Thank God this thing comes off this afternoon.
And by the way, I know what you've been thinking, and the answer is yes, I have been able to reach completion with some very precise and vigorous nipple play.
Nipple play ... off-limits.

Okay, fine.
Just get it, just get it in there in the back.
Stop moving like that.

Hi, Tanya, um, sorry I'm late.
Take a seat.
Okay.
Is everything all right?
I'll give you the bad news first.
Okay.
The bad news is, is that cutbacks are forcing me to lay off ten percent of our nontenured teachers.
That's terrible.
But the bad news is, is that it seems you are one of them.
That's not how you deliver news.
What are you doing?
Trying to make this more fun.
No.
You're right.
Tanya, I'm a really good teacher.
I care about my kids.
I spent two months in summer school with an Indian student named Vaj Rejuv and I did not laugh once, not once.
I'm sorry, Jess, but on the plus side...
you can have anything you want out of the lost-and-found box.
Okay.
Good choice.
Thank you for the opportunity.
Um, it's been an honor working here.
The dictionary defines "teacher" as...
Okay, you can take another one.
No, you can't share a bowl of cereal.
Why not?
The cast is off, gentlemen.
Great. Congratulations, man.
Good news, man.
Oh! - Oh! Yeah, take it in.
Goodness, the smell, man.
We have done nothing but love you, Schmidt.
Soak it all in, in all its foul glory.
That is not just some disgusting, salty bundle of gauze.
That is a symbol of who I was for the past two months:
The broken-penis guy.
But if there's anything that majoring in marketing with a minor in theater studies has taught me, it's that everybody has a brand.
Nick, your brand is gypsy alcoholic handyman.
Winston, your brand is Winston.
Nicholas, Winstoniel, I'm staging an event to relaunch the Schmidt brand.
It's going to happen this Saturday night, and it is going to be epic.
You're having a party to tell girls you're ready to have sex again?
Not a party;
A rebranding event.
Please tell me there's not a theme.
There most certainly is a theme ... it is a secret that will be announced on the night.
I bet it's danger.
No, you're... you're wrong. It's not danger.
It'll be announced on the night.
I really think It's going to be danger.
I'm going to go with danger.
Come on, man, it's not danger. Stop guessing danger.
Who'd you invite?
The ladies from Lululemon, my urologist, my badminton partner, my financial planner, Philip Seymour Hoffman and a guy who once wrote for a little show called Crank Yankers.
And obviously Cece.
She hasn't spoken to you all summer ...
since you broke up with her.
Yeah, I'm over it.
It's not about her. I hope she comes.
Now, let's talk venue.
Jess, oh, my God.
Are you okay?
How long have you been sitting here?
I panicked, and I grabbed the hat.
I should have grabbed the yo-yo or the slap bracelet, and now all I have is this stupid hat.
I'm sorry.
No, you're right.
I'm overthinking it. The hat's fine.
You take me home?
Yeah, of course.
I-I can't go upstairs, though,
'cause of the whole Schmidt thing.
It's going to be okay, all right?
I mean, this is the moment before something amazing is going to happen for you. I promise.
Put these on.
Is this making you feel better?
I've decided to host my relaunch event at Nick's bar.
No.
And you, my friend, are bartending.
Don't make me work for you. You can have everything else.
Come on, man. You're perfect.
You bring the heat, but you're not a thr*at in the looks department.
I get that, actually.
And only you Can make those fruity drinks that used to make the girls lose their minds in college.
Fine, I'll do it, but I'm not making those drinks.
Oh, come on, Nick. You have a gift.
Why you always trying to hide your light under a bushel?
Because, sure, I could get a girl topless, no bra, with one hollowed-out papaya, some crushed ice and two fingers of rum, but then I grew up.
Now I only want to make a drink that a coal miner would want.
Straightforward, honest.
Something that says,
"I work in a hole."
And I'm especially not making those drinks for you.
What? Why?
'Cause you can't handle it.
You drink them way too fast, and then you get weird.
Oh, come on. That was, like, years ago, dude.
I'm a changed man. I mean, look at me.
I'm wearing a suit.
A suit? Please.
That's something they put on Morgan Freeman when they let him out of Shawshank. Look at that.
What, did a magician die in that thing?
Hi.
I got laid off.
What? Are you serious?
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Obama.
It's possible I'm still in shock.
I'm going to go to my room and process what just happened.
Thank you for your attention.
Ah, this is not good. Now she's going to cry.
I hate it when she cries.
Her face gets all red and puffy.
Makes me sick.
Okay, we got to Fix this right now, guys.
Let's go. We got to do something.
Okay. Here's how this is going to go.
Hi.
You will not pity me.
No pity eyes. Schmidt, stop looking at me like I'm a fat kid riding a bike.
It's just a job. I'll get a new one.
You're going to get so many jobs, Jess. I promise.
So I just want you to go about your day and act normal.
Okay?
What's wrong with your eyes, Nick?
Stop blinking. Why are you doing that?
I just think they fired the wrong girl, kid.
Oh, for sure.
Stop. Nick!
What's up?
What's wrong with you?
You wiggin'?
Act normal, okay?
If that's what you want.
That is what I want.
That's what you'll get.
Where you going, Schmidt?
Sorry. This way.
Bye.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
How you doing, kid?
Great.
My boobs are loving this unemployed thing.
They don't have to go to boob jail every day.
Job hunt is on.
This hospital Web site says I can earn up to $700, and all I have to do is be infected with dengue fever.
Are you sure you're okay?
For the thousandth time, yes.
I know you've been waiting all week for me to break down, but I'm fine.
Just be normal.
I'm being normal.
You're crossing your legs.
I always do this.
You've never crossed your legs in your entire life.
I didn't even know you were that flexible.
Well...
And stop being nice to me.
What, I'm not normally nice to you, Jess?
No. You're mean, like a crazy old man.
"I'm Nick. I hate sunshine.
"When did gum get so fancy?
This escalator goes too fast."
Be mean.
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.
Sorry. That... that was in my head a little.
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.
No. Tighten up!
That's terrible.
I don't have it today. I don't know what it is.
Can you believe that the zoo wouldn't let me borrow their white tiger?
I mean, the nerve.
I'm going to be sitting in the back of the party, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's going to be like,
"Look at that idiot who couldn't even get a big cat."
Schmidt, you need a tiger.
I need a job.
Hire me.
No.
Here...
No, I'm not going to...
Schmidt!
What are you...?
Hire me. I am a people person.
I'm great at parties.
I can make any kind of balloon animal, as long as it's a worm or a snake...
No, Jess.
Come on.
Help a brother out.
Jess, you just got laid off, okay?
I can't have an emotionally vulnerable person on my crew.
Tonight is about one man's functioning penis.
I wouldn't say functioning.
I saw what you did to the toilet seat.
And I'm not unstable. I just need a job.
Okay, fine. You know what, Jess? Fine.
You can be my other sh*t girl.
Yes!
A sh*t girl? No, you can't be a sh*t girl.
Why not?
Because you don't have that specific hotness that shames men into spending nine dollars on a two-dollar sh*t.
She doesn't have it.
Are you saying I'm not hot?
No, no, no, I'm not... No, no, you're hot, you're hot.
Nick!
I'm saying you're the nurse That I want to wake up to after having my stomach pumped.
You know what I mean?
Its a different kind of hot ... still hot.
I'm going to be a great sh*t girl, Nick.
I pour liquids into cups every single day.
Add on top of that two years of light tap and jazz.
Please, I feel... I feel you overthinking this already.
I'm going to be the best sh*t girl in the world.
Cheers!
Cheers.
Getting my costume.
Hiya, big boy.
What's your poison?
Oh...
What?
Yeah, interesting choices.
It's a great hat. Can I have it?
Let's get rid of that.
I've decided that tonight my name is Ivy, and I'm studying to be an actress, and I'll sleep with you if you give me a part in a Paramount picture.
Do you have another Outfit in your car, or are you going to stick with this one?
Hey, young man, why weren't you drafted?
You like someone?
Good stuff.
Schmidt! Just the guy I was looking for.
So the theme of the party is...
Is danger.
That's right, but it's on a level that you couldn't possibly understand, Nick.
Okay.
Just, where... where is the other sh*t girl?
I don't know, boss.
Here I am.
Casey. Thank you for joining us. Great.
Here's where it's at.
I don't work with amateurs.
I don't split tips.
Things get a little freaky in here, I'm out the door because I'm a little diabetic and I don't need a hassle.
And also, I do accept payment in the form of whippets because I've got a PhD;
a Pretty Heavy Drug Problem.
Oh.
How old are you?
Twenty-six.
Thank you for your honesty.
Yeah! Who's up?
Okay, you jerk, come here. Stupid jerk.
Who wants a sh*t of firewater?
Anybody want me to wet their whistle?
Hey, Schmidt.
It's working, Nick. Look at all these beautiful ladies.
And this is just the beginning, man.
I can take this to the next level whenever I want.
You know why? 'Cause I got something up my sleeve.
Schmidt, please, nothing up your sleeve.
It never works!
Remain in your seat and finish the exam, Mr. Schmidt.
You know, in Student Health Services, they still call that
"Schmidting the bed."
Why are you proud of that?
What the hell is this?
Come on, Schmidt, you know I don't make girly drinks any more.
I didn't buy that stuff.
You didn't buy this? Then who did?
What's my name?
Casey!
You're all a bunch of jerks.
Yes! My penis is working!
Casey!
Hey. - Hey. Hey-hey!
Cece.
I had to check out the new and improved Schmidt.
Been hearing so much about it, so...
I'm really glad that you came.
Look, I wanted to tell you...
I want you to meet Robby, my, uh, my boyfriend.
Your what?
There he is.
The one shaped like a Liberty Bell?
It's a great party. Thank you for inviting us.
Flip it, man, flip it!
I'm flipping it!
Did you guys see Cece's new boyfriend, the commoner?
Oh, wow, Schmidty, you really lowered Cece's bar.
There's got to be an explanation for this, like he's the Lord of Winterfell or he's working with a real piece of pipe.
Schmidt? Schmidt, don't get hung up on that guy.
And here comes the weirdness.
Not weird, just a guy who really wants a drink.
Mm-mmm! Mmm...
Mmm!
It's like an expl*si*n of fruit!
There it is.
Look at me being so naughty!
So naughty.
Hey.
I'm Schmidt.
I, too, was a sexual partner of Cece.
Welcome to the party.
Thank you for having me.
Let me just tell you this is a very impressive party.
There's speakers everywhere. There's one over there.
I saw two on the back wall.
Oh, there's one right there. Didn't see that one before.
Yeah, there's a lot of speakers. Lot of...
Lots of speakers. Yeah.
So, so what's your deal?
I mean, do you vacation in Europe ever?
No. You know, I've never left California in my life.
You in a band?
I don't, I don't like music. What's up with me, you know?
You work for Goldman then?
For who?
This feels good. I'm gonna go.
Congratulations on your penis, man.
What's your name?
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Oh!
Could I get a broom?!
Look at my butt.
Look at my butt, stupid jerks.
Hey, Jess.
Nick, I'm fine.
I don't need you to be nice to me right now.
Okay. You want me to be mean?
Yes.
I'll give you mean, Jess.
This is the easiest job in the whole world!
The only thing easier than this is passing out cigarettes to prisoners.
And what if I wanted to take a body sh*t off you?
Oh, yeah! I can't because you're wearing a turn-of-the-century bathing costume.
How's this? Are you getting mad or are you happy with this?
It's good. That's really good.
So stop feeling sorry for yourself, kid, and get up on that bar and shake that piece of plywood that you call an ass!
That's too far!
Yeah, yeah, I agree. You got a great ass.
That is too far!
That is too far.
This is so fun!

You know, this Robby guy's got nothing on me.
Right.
I think I can get Cece back.
Seriously, just let it go.
I just need to remind her how amazing I am.
Luckily, I've got something up my sleeve.
Schmidt, no, no! Schmidt, don't!
Schmidt, no sleeves, please!
sh*t girl, sh*t girl!
sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl!

I'm a sh*t girl.
Oh.
I'm a sh*t girl.
Hey, J-Jess, Jess.
Jess, where are you going?
What am I doing, Nick? I'm a teacher.
I'm not a sh*t girl.
f*re...
the most dangerous element of all of the elements.
Now I'm doing this.
Okay, let's see here.
And then now I'm doing this.
Sure. And now I'm not sure what I'm doing.
I'm not actually quite sure how to stop this.
Um, this is definitely real f*re.
I'm very apologetic. I think everyone should leave.
Um, thank you very much for coming.
There's party favors at the door.
I'd like to thank my urologist for coming.
Oh, wait. No, no, no, everybody, look.
I'm okay. I got it under control.
Cece, watch this one.
Hey, look, Cece. f*re!
Where's Robby?
Pulling the car around.
You really scared him.
Why haven't you called me back in two months, Cece?
You are the one who broke up with me.
I don't see you until you show up here tonight with... with a boyfriend?
And please, please tell me he's on some sort of medication that's making him temporarily bloated.
Come on, okay?
You and I both know we never would have worked.
We are far too alike.
Both so beautiful.
You're gonna be fine. You know that, right?
Hey, uh, Cece, I...
I got to know, why him?
I mean, what, what is his brand?
He's just a good guy.
And I'm...
too dangerous?
Yeah, that's it.
I'll see you around, Schmidt.
Yeah.
Fun fact:
There's a reason why guys nickname me "T-Ball."
When they step up to the plate, they never strike out.
Honey, what happened to you in your life that made you like this?
I graduated from MIT, and then I got into a horrible accident where I lost half my brain.
There it is.
I came back to say good-bye.
I figured that.
I was kidding myself.
I love teaching.
It's who I am.
What if I can't do anything else?
Jess, come on. I can't do anything, and look at me.
I'm kind of fine, you know?
It's just that being a teacher was all I ever, ever wanted to do.
It just, it just sucks, you know?
Yeah, life sucks!
And then it gets better, and then it sucks again.
Yeah.
And then, and then it just...
Sucks.
...sucks.
Nick.
What?
Will you be mean to me one more time?
Look sharp, you dumb-ass!
You look sharp!
You're a terrible sh*t girl!
You got hoof hands and a plywood ass, kid!
You call that a sh*t girl outfit, you dumb-ass?
I got mixed up ... I thought it was a cigarette girl.
That is what happened.
You look like a cigarette girl.

Here you guys go. Some cookies.
Wow.
Okay, great. Um, as you guys know, I'm moving in with Caroline, and I'm glad we can talk about this like adults.
Caroline is, uh, quite the baker.
Anything else, anyone?
You're making a huge, life-ruining mistake by moving in with a woman who turned you into an agoraphobic, turtle-faced, borderline alcoholic.
I'm going to start over,
'cause this did not go the way I had planned.
As you guys know, I'm leaving, so there are some things we need to work out.
Yeah, like, what am I going to do with all that extra money I have now that I don't have to cover for you any more?
Okay.
Maybe I'll buy a city.
Oh, and you can open a mall And call it Winston's Corners.
What are you guys doing?
You're just sitting here and letting this happen?
What else are we going to do?
The guy obviously knows what he wants.
I do.
When Nick leaves, I'm going to call a plumber and just throw cash at him while he works.
Fitties and hunnits, hunnits, hunnits.
Look, while you're at it, can you please call an exterminator so we can get rid of that crime against nature?
Yeah, he's not fooling anyone.
You think, just 'cause he's a snappy dresser, the mice don't see the hammer?
Mice come from all over the building to laugh at that dummy witch.
Is this a freaking carob chip?
What, are you trying to buy our love with hippie chocolate?
You idiot.
Aren't you going to miss this, Nick?

Winston, can you take me to the doctor tomorrow?
He's taking the bandages off.
Wow.
The old Washington Monument.
Ready to serve this great nation once again.
Can you stop?
What?
It's time to make this horse into a unicorn.
Can we save this talk until after we're done interviewing Neil here to take Nick's room?
Hey, don't worry about me.
I could talk about my dingus all night long.
Neil, tell us about yourself ... you know, uh, anything we should know, aside from the fact that you responded to our Craigslist ad with a fax?
Well, um, yeah, my name is Neil.
Um, just coming out of a pretty hairy divorce.
I am in human resources.
Well, I used to be.
I had the unique, uh, experience of having to let myself go.
I did not take it well.
Let me ask you a question.
I would love for you to save your questions till the end.
Are you going to be a wuss about things like crabs and bedbugs?
Like, crabs from Maine?
I hope you like feminist rants,
'cause that's kind of my thing.
Neil, she's just saying this to scare you.
What are you...
What are you doing?
Shut up.
I'm a cutter.
Neil, uh, I want you to give us a minute, okay?
I got to go talk to my roommates in the bathroom. Guys? - Okay. Yeah.
You're acting insane.
I'm acting insane? That guy's insane.
Look, Jess, when you moved in, we all had to roll with it.
To be fair, you do some pretty weird stuff.
You know, I still can't get used to the way you let us know when you're using the toilet.
I'm good with Neil.
I am, too.
What are you guys doing?
Nick's leaving.
You're his friends.
Aren't you going to fight for him to stay?
You're in.
Ah, yes! Okay.
And get ready for songs,
'cause I am kind of a troubadour.
This is happening, Nick. This is happening.
Whoa, whoa! Why you taking back your lamp?
I think you just answered that when you called it my lamp.
No, man. Squatters' rights.
What's wrong? You still afraid of the dark?
What? No. Dude.
'Cause, if you are, I'll leave this behind.
Nick, first of all, I'm not afraid of the dark.
But if I were afraid of the dark, that would be a totally rational, adaptive evolutionary response.
Good night, Winston.
That's ridiculous.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Good night, sweetheart.
Unless the monsters get you.
Hey.
You came.
Whoa.
What you got in there?
It's a hard cast.
Yeah, things didn't go quite like we had hoped at the doctor.
Yeah, so I told the guy I had never been snowmobiling in my life, you know, and...
Oh, God!
That's not my penis.
But look, on the bright side, it is impossible for me to get aroused in this thing.
Here, watch ... say something hot to me.
Fresh-pressed linens.
Nope, nothing.
Not an inch.
Like a swaddled baby.
Hey, Cece.
They're ready for us.
Oh, okay.
Just hang out, okay? Have fun.
That's right. Ride that m*ssile.
Grip it. Yeah.
You've got a whole t*nk full of jet fuel.
You're heading straight for the sun.
What the hell w*r is this?
All right, turn around and face him.
Am-am I...
Am I supposed to want to buy a m*ssile?
I don't understand.
Just pounding the drum of w*r.
What-what, did no one listen to Eisenhower?
All right, so that's everything.
I took my fair share of rubber bands, so I don't want to hear about it.
In my room, you will find a shoe box.
In that box, there is a guinea pig that I said I would bury, so please deal with it.
There's a corpse in your room?
All right, guys, well, thanks for helping me move.
What are we standing in a circle for, like a bunch of weirdos? Let's go.
Hey, Nick?
Yeah.
Why are you rushing this?
You have so much time.
Why not just...
take a second and think about this?
I feel confident.
I-I couldn't be more confident, Jess.
Are you?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yes.
Are you really?
Thanks for helping me move.
I love the way he smelled.
Caroline and I are starting a whole new life together.
Right now, we're trying to decide between eggshell and soft mint for the walls.
My gut says that eggshell is trying too hard, but soft mint is really tricky to match.
Have I told you guys about the bay windows I'm going to have?
Yes, you have.
Yeah, you just did.
They are stunning, right?
I'm going to curl up in those like a damn cat.
That's the place.
That's-that'sthe place right there?
Right there, yeah.
Aren't you going to stop?
Yeah, seems like I should.
Um, hey-hey, Nick.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm freaking out! Yeah!
What are you...?
Oh, no.
Oh, Nick Miller's freaking out again!
Whoop-de-whoo.
What's new?
Come on!
What the hell? You think he's okay, man?
Oh, no, no, no, he's totally fine.
We do this every day.
We just never invite you, Winston.
What have I done?!
Hey, Nick, I'm pretty sure you overshot the apartment by like 140 miles!
Let's just hop back in the truck, turn around and go home.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Okay? Okay.
This is crazy that I drove out here.
Yeah, it is.
Give me the keys. I'll drive you back to Caroline.
Caroline... no!
Well, that was unexpected.
♪ I like to move in, move in, I like to move in, move in ♪
♪ I like to ♪
♪ Move in. ♪
I like it quiet, quiet.
Okay, I rode up in the elevator with that guy, and something growled in that box.
I hope he has a pet. That would cheer me up.
Um, is Schmidt here?
No, he's helping Nick move ... but, uh, Neil is.
Do you want to do a sex-only thing with him?
He came by my sh**t earlier and was so jealous.
He was freaking out the entire time.
Oh.
It's him, so...
Hi, Schmidt.
How's it going?
How's the new apartment?
Does it smell like, uh, new paint and compromise?
What?
Where?
There's not much sunlight left.
What are you afraid of, the dark?
No, I'm not afraid of the dark.
Worried about Schmidt. He's a Jew in the desert.
I don't want him to wander.
That's Caroline. Now, what do I tell her?
Tell her there's freaking f*re ants everywhere.
Give me a sec.
Hey.
Nick, where are you?
In the desert.
The what?
Yeah, I kind of...
I kind of freaked out.
Look, I know it's a lot.
Just get back here as soon as you can, and we'll...
we'll figure it out.
Really?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Think I overreacted by throwing my keys earlier.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I don't know why I ever doubted Caroline. She's the best.
So, why the hell would you throw your damn keys away?!
I deserve this.
I'm going to k*ll you!
Hey, Winston, no.
The boat is going down!
All right, all right.
Calm down. Nick!
I'll k*ll you! I'll k*ll you!
Enough!
Would you stop it? There's v*olence everywhere!
Why are we fighting? Why are we fighting?
Oh, good.
Oh, thank God.
Hey, Jess!
What took you so long?
Let me tell you something ... you never want to lose a race against the night.
Nice new place, Nick.
It's very spacious.
Yes, I'm an idiot, Jess.
Really nice.
Hey.
That's for you.
What happened at the sh**t?
You... you kind of left before I had a chance to say good-bye.
Good stuff, sure.
It was hard to tell where you stopped and Goggles McHardBody began.
That's my job.
Gino is just some guy that I see around the office, except for, in my office, they rub us down with baby oil before we start.
Yeah, I-I get that.
Look, your business is selling sex.
Sure, you're a sex worker.
You're an idiot.
If we leave right now, I can get back to Caroline by 8:00.
Caroline?
Yeah, I-I changed my mind. Gonna move in.
Yeah, and I actually don't even care about this truck.
I'll come back and get it tomorrow.
I say we just leave now, get out of the desert.
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
Here's my question.
What's that?
How are you going to get there?
Uh, I think you're going to drive me.
Oh, I don't think so.
Wait. What?
Then why'd you come out to the desert?
What?!
What? What are you doing?
Jess.
Jess!
No!
Come on!
People, just please listen to me.
Stop throwing your damn keys!
The werewolves come out at night, man.
I don't want nobody to eat me!
I got big thighs. I got a fat ass.
Relax.
We are in the middle of the desert, and nobody is going to find our bodies!
Come here.
What?
You're having a nervous breakdown.
You're having a nervous breakdown.
The tow truck can't come until tomorrow.
Aren't you glad I stole all this beer?
Hello. Look what I found.
Don't. Put that away.
No, I have to hear it.
I-I'm begging you to put that away. It's humiliating.
I made that when I was 14.
Nick, I have to hear this.
This next song - Turn it up. No, please...
Goes out to a very special girl, Gwen Bressler.
I know you like breakfast, but how do you feel about...
"Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."
Oh, that is a terrible song.
This is a great song.
You guys are crazy. Listen to the lyrics.
Oh, man. I feel it in my body.
Oh...
Are you kidding me? This is in my bones.
♪ I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's"?♪
No!
♪ Something, something ♪
♪ Da da-da da-ta ♪
Gwen, you don't even know my name, do you?
"How Bizarre."
Oh, yes, this is where Nick got cool again.
Oh, not you, too.
God, I'm like, I'm back.
Thank you for doing this, actually.
Make fun of me all you want.
I'm back! I'm back!
Thank you for doing this.
♪ In the hot, hot sun ♪
♪ Suddenly, red-blue lights flash us from behind ♪
♪ Loud voice booming... ♪
I'm gonna miss this, you guys.
Just all of us, together, making fun of Nick.
Okay.
All right, I did it.
I'm an idiot.
I see what you guys are doing.
I get it.
You're trying to force me to remember how great it is when we're all hanging out so I don't want to leave.
We're just having fun.
I get it.
You guys think I'm dumb and I make bad decisions, but this isn't that.
No.
What? Come on.
You're being crazy. Where are you going?
To get my keys.
Dude, where you going?
You're never gonna find your keys.
What's wrong with you?
You're stress-eating meat.
Hey, Jess.
How many have you had?
Like, three.
That's a lot of pig parts.
It's just Cece.
I thought it was going so well between you guys.
Yeah.
You know, she's a good egg.
She's never gonna be happy with somebody like me, Jess.
What? That's crazy.
That's why I'm gonna have to White Fang her.
Schmidt, come on!
Look, I try not to judge what you guys do, but please don't tell me things like that.
No, no, Jess, Jess.
The book: White Fang.
Oh.
This guy Befriends a wild creature.
But he must, he must set the animal free because that's what's best for it.
I know the plot of White Fang.
But the animal won't go.
So with a breaking heart, he throws stones at it until it runs away.
You-you want Cece to go away?
No.
I want her to be happy.
'Cause when-when you care about somebody, you do what's-what's best for them.
Even if it sucks for you.
Even if they're just a "woof."
A wolf?
A "woof."
A wolf.
Yeah, that's what I said, a "woof."
A wolf.
A "woof."
Come on, keys.
Hey, Nick?
Come on, they could be anywhere.
Let's come back in the morning.
I don't want to come back in the morning, Jess.
Okay, I want to be in my new bed, in my new apartment, with my new old girlfriend.
Okay, just ... look, I know I've been ...
What?
Oh, my God.
Shh-shh. Shh.
Oh, my God.
Okay, just be cool.
What do we do? What do we do?
I don't know, I don't know what to do!
Okay, but, Jess, we have to do something! - Shh.
Meep-meep!
What are you doing?
Like the Road Runner.
I know it's like the Road Runner.
Why would you do the Road Runner?
Because he's...
Don't do that, Jess.
Meep-meep!
Jess, honestly, Don't do the Road Runner to a coyote!
That's how you deal with coyotes.
Coyotes hate roadrunners!
That's how you deal with them.
Coyotes want to k*ll roadrunners!
Meep-meep!
Oh, you...
No disrespect.
It's watching us. It's watching us.
We need to talk.
All right.
This is not another one of those
"merlot is the whore of the vineyard" talks, is it?
This isn't working out.
Are you kidding... right now?
Are you trying to end this with me?
Now go on!
You heard me!
Go on!
Go on, scram!
Go!
I hate you! Go!
Go back to your kind!
Are you White Fanging me?
Sorry, what?
White Fang, Schmidt.
The only book on your Kindle.
The one that you wouldn't stop talking about.
Remember, I said, "Please,"
stop talking about White Fang."
And you said, "Someday, I'm gonna do this to somebody."
That White Fang. Uh-huh.
Why are you trying to push me away?
I saw your phone, Cece.
I saw the text message from Gino.
Your colleague.
You went through my phone?
What? No.
Winston... Winston went through your phone.
That is not okay.
This is about trust, Schmidt, okay?
It's about trust.
And I told you how this was gonna be, and I asked you to get okay with it.
How am I supposed to trust you, Cece?
You slept with me.
I mean, that doesn't say much about your taste in men.
And I have more than one book on my Kindle.
And a subscription to Cricket.
And a lot of PDFs!
Doesn't he have somewhere to be?
Well, this is a disaster.
Why did you keep driving?
I don't want to talk to you about this, Jess.
I know what you're gonna say, and I don't want to hear it.
No.
No, you don't know what I'm gonna say.
I want you to be happy.
And if that means moving in with Caroline, then I think you should do it.
That's what you think?
I think you need me too much.
No, I'm gonna be fine. I am.
I don't think so.
You know why?
Why?
'Cause I met you.
That's why I'm okay.
That's why I can do this.
What are you doing?
To b*at the coyote, you have to be the coyote.
That's what I thought you were gonna say.
That's a very dumb idea. Don't do this.
I'm not with her on this.
This is her move, not mine, sir.
No.
Oh, my God.
I did it!
Oh, my God.
I did it! I have so much dirt in my mouth, and I did it!
Come here, come here.
I did it!
Nice job!
I did it!
Oh, my God. Schmidt?
Hello?
Winston?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!
Oh... my goodness!
He'll be fine.
I don't know.
You guys want some candy or something?
Found it in the truck.
No.
I don't want your dirty lolly.
Guys!
Ah!
Whoo!
I survived, man.
I made it out alive.
Wait, wait, don't touch me.
Don't touch...
There's, uh, there's pee everywhere.
Like... everywhere.
It's everywhere?
Well, I didn't just pee on me.
I peed ... well, I peed on me, but other-other things peed on me, too.
I saw things, man.
I had an experience.
I think I made out with the side of a dune.
Hey!
Look, I found my keys!
Ah! Thank God!
We still on for brunch?
Gonna come help me unload my stuff tomorrow?
No, not a chance.
No, yeah, so we can't do brunch.
Just go.
Get in the car.
Unacceptable.
Good luck.
Well...
Well...
All right, I'll see you.
See ya.
Wow.
Look how pronounced Nick's couch hole got.
All this time I thought he was just sitting here drinking beer and complaining, he was making something.
Hey.
What do you think?
Hey, WNICK listeners, this one is going out to all the ladies I'm gonna meet when I grow up.
Not.
Hey.
Welcome back, you clown.

Hey, Jess.
I brought you some tea.
Just gonna leave it right here, okay?
There you go.
So, Russell...
Ouch.
Right? I mean, who saw that coming?
Not me.
Certainly not Russell.
I guess, I guess you saw it coming.
I mean, 'cause you're the one who broke up with him.
Leave, Schmidt.
All right, fine.
I'll leave. But you know what?
Know this: you're not the only one that's hurting here, Jessica Day. The economy stinks, bees are dying, movies are pretty much all sequels now, and I...
Don't say "broken penis."
...have a broken penis.
Don't pretend to know my pain.
(song continues)
Hey, Jess.
Hi.
What's this song called?
"The River."
Hmm.
Do you like it?
Yeah, yeah, I liked the way you played it for the first time at 10:00 last night.
I liked it a little bit less at 2:00 a.m.
And now I'm kind of hoping that the sun comes up, thaws that river and that woman drowns.
Get out!
(song continues)
Russell was perfect.
What's wrong with me?
Am I self-sabotaging?
Am I secretly a Cylon?
You just didn't love him.
But what if it's me?
What if I have some idea of love in my head and it's just totally wrong?
Do not second-guess yourself, okay?
It was a tough choice, but it was the right choice.
Yeah, mm-hmm.
So what do you think about turning off that song?
I just feel like I should...
Off. Turn it off.
Ow.
♪ It's coming on Christmas... ♪
(song stops)
WINSTON: Oh, my God, she's d*ad! SCHMIDT: Oh, no, no, come on!
80 more times! I get it now! It's a river!
All right, now let's go and get a drink, because you really need to get out of this room.
I'm not ready.
Turn that song back on!
Caroline and I made up a dance routine to cheer you up.
No, you didn't.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna dance, and Nick's gonna clap.
Okay. I'll just clap.
You about ready now?
Yeah, I'm ready now.
Yeah, let's go.
Uh, feel it. Uh, uh.
Get it, Caroline! Get it, Caroline!

I'm gonna end up alone.
I'm gonna be a single old lady flashing people on the subway.
Jess, first of all, you're never gonna be old, because humans ... we're gonna be immortal by 2026.
And second of all, give me your phone.
Why?
Do you want to drunkenly call Russell tonight and tell him what a huge mistake you made?
You don't want to backslide, trust me.
Be quiet.
Your life is too perfect to talk to anyone in Jess's condition right now.
Look, Jess, backsliding is what happens after a clean break.
When you, when you freak out and you go crawling back and you just make everything messy and horrible.
I'm not gonna do that.
You have backslider written all over you.
Did I tell you guys that my boss invited me to play poker with him tonight?
Crazy thing, he never invites anybody to play poker with him.
I mean, come on, I'm in the prime of my life, baby.
Winston, shut up!
Shut up!
JESS:
Schmidt, I actually need my phone back.
No.
I need to call Russell to just tell him I left my pajamas there.
The fact that you were wearing pajamas in the presence of your lover tells me that that relationship was doomed from the start. No way.
Disgusting.
Don't fake me ... don't fake me out.
Are you guys playing a game?
No. No. Just chillin'.
Hey, good-lookin'.
Hey.
What can I get you?
How about one of those Nick Miller Manhattans?
Ah, straight bourbon in a plastic cup.
(chuckles)
Come with me.
Think we should show him the DVD?
What DVD?
Nick made a DVD after the last time Caroline broke up with him.
It's all the reasons why they shouldn't get back together.
We hid it somewhere in the loft.
Ooh. Intrigue.
Mama like.
I don't know that we should...
Cece's here.
Why is she dressed like a women's studies major?
SCHMIDT:
It's precautionary.
Just until my junk heals.
Ow. Owie.
Damn it.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
What is going on, Jess?
I was just thinking about this word that I learned from Schmidt.
Backsliding.
Oh, so you're saying I'm a backslider.
I don't know what we're supposed to do together any more.
Everything seems to turn you on.
Oh, look, Cece, a bird. Ow. Ah, damn it!
Schmidt, it's a mother bird in her nest!
Must I say it, Cece?
What?
Eggs.
Okay.
Okay, sure, look, did Caroline physically, ment*lly and emotionally abuse me for years?
Yes!
But she changed.
It's about timing.
And the first time around, we weren't ready to work at it, and now we are.
And besides, Caroline is way hotter than that voice in my head, who sounds like Tom Waits and tells me I'm a failure and that I look bad in hats.
I don't want to spend my whole life with him.
You know what I mean?
Okay.
At least you'll get a break from me tomorrow.
I've got to go visit my dadi.
What?
It's my grandmother.
Oh, your bubbe?
Yes, my...
Oh, I have a bubbe.
Uh, my bubbe is in a home.
Yeah.
Old people freak me out.
With their hands and their legs.
Just, they're like the human version of pleated pants.
Really?
Not for me.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey.
Can I borrow your jacket?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
CECE:
Like, aren't into old people?
SCHMIDT:
Not at all.
I mean, just-just horr...
like giant walking raisins.
They're in a home...
It's me.
I've been thinking a lot about you.
(whispers):
Jess.
Hmm?
I can't feel my arm.
(sighs)
Oh.
Whoa.
I really can't feel it at all.
Wake up, fella.
You're gonna be late for school.
(sighs)
Genzlinger.
(sighs)
What is that?
It's an earring, man. What does it look like?
Got kind of wasted last night with Joe, and so, you know, I got my ear pierced.
This is the perfect moment.
(giggling)
Wait, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
Wait, what?
I'm gonna do.
See, this is when it gets weird between us.
One, two, three.
(grunts)
(screams)
You know, traditionally, the male of the species is more glamorous.
When's it coming out, by the way?
The earring? - No, no, the smooth jazz album you're dropping.
Hey, guys. You remember, um, Paul.
Mercedes-Genz!
WINSTON:
Genzel Washington.
It's the Genz of the world as we know it.
All right, everybody, put down your Genz and your Genzils.
Hey, Schmidt. What's up, Washington?
Um hey.
Hey.
So maybe ...
Okay.
We definitely ...
Oh yeah, that sounds...
Okay.
Okay.
Okay All right.
Backslider!
Don't.
You backslid.
Come on.
You backslid all the way down the hill and back into the parking lot.
Take off your skis and wait for your family in the lodge, Jessica Day.
Look, I think this could be good.
Paul and I had really bad timing before, and maybe I should just give it another sh*t.
Such an ugly crier.
He is the all-time worst crier.
(sobbing)
It's like he's a slow-motion sneeze.
Winston, what is in your ear?
It's hot and I love it.
Does that feed information back to Shelby to keep track of your migration patterns?
Drop it.
Please, Jess.
He just got back from Carnival.
Know what?
(whispers): These people are disgusting.
I've never been more flaccid in my life.
(laughs)
Thank God.
I mean, this place is a cardigan gold mine.
Can I get you anything, Dadi?
A hot-blooded man and a hotel room would be nice.
Oh, just get me a puzzle.
Yeah?
I raised that girl.
She is my life.
And she's not as tough as she looks.
If you hurt her, I will let myself die and then I will haunt you.
Whoa, look at this fireplace.
It's huge.
Caroline, that is not a fireplace, that is, like, a room you could safely set on f*re.
(chuckles)
Yeah, this is really nice.
It is.
So grown up.
But where's all your stuff gonna go?
Like, where will the Grateful d*ad bears dance?
Oh, I didn't realize I lived here, too.
Seriously though, what do you think about moving in?
Wait, you want to move in together?
Yeah, I mean, I feel like if we're gonna do this again, we should do it for real this time, you know?
Right.
I mean, I'm 33 years old.
You're 30 years old; we're the same age, you knucklehead.
No, I lied about that. I'm 33.
I don't want to start at the beginning again with you.
I mean, you're not... not making sense.
(school bell ringing, knocking)
Knock-knock.
Hi.
Hi back.
Um...
Hey...
I want to tell you...
I have something to tell you.
Oh, sorry, you go first.
Oh, I'll go first.
Um, I was thinking a lot about, um...
you and last night.
Right.
And we have something good.
Jess, I have a girlfriend.
What?
Yeah.
Very serious girlfriend.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?
(sighs) When you called me last night, we had just gotten into this huge fight, and I was really confused.
You cheating on her with me?
Is that bad? That's bad.
It's really bad.
Oh, no, that's really bad.
Why would you do that?!
Now I know what Bill Clinton feels like.
Now I know how Monica Lewinsky feels!
I'm sorry I made you feel like Monica Lewinsky.
Stop crying!
You are literally the ugliest crier I have ever seen!
You cry smile.
Hey, babe, I'm here for lunch.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, no, are you crying?
Is everything okay?
There's-there's...
I'm sorry to have to break it to you, but that is the way the electoral college works, man.
It-it seems so unfair.
So votes don't mean as much.
It upsets me, too.
(video game music playing)
I'm gonna miss you, Winston.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna miss you when your caravan moves on to the next village.
(door opens, closes)
Oh, my God!
He has a girlfriend!
He cheated on his girlfriend with me.
I'm a cheater.
P. Genz played you?
I saw her.
She looks like an Asian me.
Asian Jess. Wo ... Ow.
I can't even backslide right.
I've been her.
I've been Asian me before.
Are you gonna keep calling her "Asian me," because it's becoming a problem for me.
I don't know her name, Schmidt.
But I do know that if I were her, I would want to know what kind of person I was dating.
And that's why I have to tell her.
What? No, don't do that.
Please don't do that.
Mm-mm. Sometimes, when you make a mistake, all you can do is own up to it, all right?
Because it's something you can't fix.
Knowledge.
Take it easy, black George Michael.
I have to do it.
I have to tell her.
61 years we've been together.
14 presidents and four different Batmen.
Why don't we go for a walk?
I'm just gonna go get your sweater.
I'll be back in a second.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Give me one second.
Wow, so you guys are like real live Yodas, huh?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
sh**t, cowboy.
How do you build a relationship?
How 'bout Viagra?
I use it just to keep from falling out of bed.
How does a guy like me have a chance at making someone like Cece happy?
You don't. Not with all those moles on your face.
I should just give up, huh?
That's crazy!
She needs you!
DADI: You are exactly what she needs.
(sighs)
Here's your sweater, Dadi.
Oh, thank you.
Um, I'll meet you out there in a second, okay?
Okay.
Take it easy, Burt.
(sighs)
You know, for the first time in my life I actually feel like I want something that lasts.
And I want it with you.
I feel... the same way.
You do?
(groaning)
Oh!
(moaning)
It hurts so bad, because...
What's turning you on?
Oh...
The queen of diamonds?
The bow?
Oh, my God.
The teeth in the glass?
I care about you so much.
The leaf painting?
But...
Is emotional intimacy turning you on?
(groans)
(groaning)
Are you in that much pain?
Uh, he passed out.
We need help!
Yo. What's up, man?
How'd the audition go?
What?
For the Disney pirate movie?
Ha-ha.
Hey, Mr. T called.
He wants to punch you because that earring looks stupid.
I mean, Lil' Wayne wears it, so...
Oh, Little Wayne Gonzales from Brazil?
Who came to the United States to dance and be free!
You can't touch me, baby. I'm in the prime of my life.
Tell me, what are you doing? What you been doing all day?
Oh, I'm actually looking for an apartment. It's for Caroline.
She's looking for a new apartment, and she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, and I'm thinking about it.
Cool! Cool, cool, sounds like so much fun.
I'm really glad that's your reaction, because I thought you were going to tell me I was making a huge mistake.
Honestly, I didn't want to hear that.
Wouldn't do that, that'd be silly.
(Winston trilling)
(cawing)
What are you doing? Huh? What?
No, Nick... No, no, no! No!
Nick. Nick. Nick, Nick! Nick! Don't!
It's for your own good.
Get out of there!
What are you...? No, Schmidt!
Grab him! Okay, grab him.
You got him?
Watch the television.
You got him?
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch the television. Watch the TV...
All right, all right, watch the TV.
Hello, Nick... NICK: No!
In all its glory, watch it.
You magnificent dumb-ass.
Come on.
If you're watching this, it's because you decided to get back with Caroline.
Yes, Nick. I did.
Well, congratulations, you idiot.
She destroyed you.
You don't know me, you jerk!
These, my dumb friend, are your tears.
And you saved them all.
I got him, I got him.
Think back, Nick, Stay still.
Or whatever they call you in your time.
Who dumped you three times?
Once before you had to speak at your brother's wedding.
Well, he's divorced now, so I'll get another sh*t.
This is a poem you wrote about Caroline...
I don't want the poem.
I don't want the poem.
You're getting the poem.
...But you're too emotional to read it right now.
You're going to give it to Schmidt for safekeeping.
This is your doing, Caroline.
You were right to have trusted me.
Two years I held this thing.
Read it.
(sobbing): Here they come.
NICK:
Okay.
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
No, a summer's day is not a bitch."
(Nick whimpers on video)
Really, Nick?
That's how you want to talk about Caroline?
I can't move, my earring is stuck.
But there's something I want to do to you, then.
Don't move, don't move. Don't move, Nick, don't move!
Let's have a conversation like men! Let's act like men, Nick! Ah!
You want to act like men, let's act like men.
Look at how far you've come, Nick.
Want to be a bartender forever, pal?
I'm still a bartender.
You want to be a grown man who dresses like an unsponsored professional skateboarder?
You don't want to live like this. You're moving on.
I'm here to tell you you're doing the right thing, so just keep going.
Can I talk to you Nick-to-Nick for a second?
I respect you, man. You're rocking the hell out of that beard, and the long hair looks good, despite what other people are gonna say.
Look, the Caroline that broke your heart, I get why you don't like her.
But it's a different Caroline that's picking me up
(groans)
in five minutes, Nick.
Do you want me to live alone in this loft for the rest of my life?
Hey, what's the difference between me and Bill Cosby?
Well, thanks, guys. You helped me figure something out.
NICK (on video):
All right, well, look, I think this was a really nice talk, Future Nick.
I hope you got something from it, 'cause I know that I did.
(crying):
I'm gonna call her.
I have to call..
No! Damn it, give me the phone.
Please get out of here, I have to call... Coach! He's calling her again.
We lost him.
We sure did, Captain Black Sparrow.
Hey, Paul.
Hey.
I'm not going to let you lie to your girlfriend.
Okay? It's not fair to her.
So you have to tell her what happened between us.
Or I will.
All right. You're right.
I have to tell her.
Yeah.
I'm so scared, though. I don't want to lose her, Jess.
She's my soul mate.
For someone with a soul mate, you sure did have sex with me.
I know. I know, and I don't expect you to believe me ...
I wouldn't believe me if I were you ...
but check it out.
I even bought her an engagement ring.
(sighs)
Oh...
That's... that's really beautiful.
I've been carrying it around in my pocket for two weeks, trying to find the right way to propose to her.
And I just started panicking, and I got...
I don't know, I got scared, and-and-and really confused, and I'm so sorry to drag you into this, but this was the biggest mistake of my life.
God, Paul, don't make me feel sorry for you.
I know. I messed up.
Big-time.
And I'm going to lose her.
Oh, God, I can't lose her!
Hey, babe, you left your tuner in my car.
Oh. Hi! You're Jess, right?
I'm Jenn.
Jenn.
Well, I was just leaving.
Jess and I slept together.
Oh, God.
What? - I want to be completely honest with you.
It happened two days ago, and we did lots of stuff.
There was talking, and there were hands, and I think we ruined a throw pillow.
He's making it sound a lot more erotic than it was.
It was just, like, lying there and... blah.
I am so sorry.
I'm... I'm begging you to forgive me.
(crying):
I thought you loved me.
I'm so sorry.
(crying):
I'm an idiot!
(sniffles)
I'm an idiot, I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God. No...
Yeah, I'm such an idiot.
(sobbing)
Good-bye, Paul.
Oh, no. Wait. Wait. Jenn?
Haven't you done enough?
Yeah, I have. I have done enough, but...
I know how you feel.
I've been there. I've been cheated on before, and it feels like someone dropped an anvil on your heart.
Um, but...
That guy wasn't right for me.
You guys...
You guys are perfect together.
I thought you were Asian me, but now I realize I'm just Caucasian you.
What?
What?
Paul was scared.
And when you're scared, you do stupid things.
He made a really terrible mistake.
Really terrible.
The things that we did
48 hours ago were so dark...
I'm handling this.
Sorry.
Jenn...
you love Paul.
I know that because you're still standing here.
What you guys have...
it's way bigger than me.
And I think...
I think Paul has something to ask you.
I know this is not the right time to do this, in fact, this is a terrible time to do this, but I don't care.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Jennifer Ruth Toyogi.
I know that now more than ever.
Now that you slept with her.
Happy to help. Uh-huh.
If... if you still love me, at all...
Of course I still do. I...
(sighs)
Oh, yeah.
Um...
Ooh...
Will you... will you...
will you, will you marry him?
(whispers):
Yeah.
Is that a "yes"?
Yes.
(boy playing
"Bridal Chorus")
So you and Cece are staying away from each other.
Only until my penis stops looking like a knotted wizard's staff.
That sounds tough, man.
Guys like us ...
Nick, too ... we're warriors.
We just keep on fighting, and holding on, even when we know we're just making a big mistake.
Like Nick and Caroline.
And that earring.
I'm not giving this thing up.
You look like you were caught by a fly fisherman.
Dude, I've had it with the earring jokes.
You look like you should be standing in line to get into Shaquille O'Neal's birthday party.
Oh, my God, you guys.
The most exciting thing just happened.
I helped Paul propose to his girlfriend. They are engaged.
Awesome. - I feel like you're leaving out part of that story.
Where's Nick? I want to tell him.
This should be fun. Um...
yeah, Nick has something to tell you, too.
He's in the bathroom.
Oh, great.
Really?
She's gonna find out anyway.
(water running)
Nick! Nick!
Hey.
What, Jess?
Um, Paul proposed to his girlfriend in front of me.
That sounds pretty awkward.
She said yes, and it was... it was really...
it was really beautiful.
And it made me realize something.
You're wrong. All the stuff you said about Caroline, being about timing, and it just making sense?
No.
Because if you really love someone, it's simple.
Okay. Well, I understand what you're saying, but...
You deserve something amazing.
And... you deserve love.
I know you don't want to be alone, but I'm going to be there, and I'll tell that Tom Waits voice in your head to shut up.
(Tom Waits voice):
We don't have to settle...
Nick.
You're the best.
I'm moving in with Caroline.
We signed a lease this morning.
Thanks for saying all that stuff.
Now that I got your attention, Future Nick, there's a few things I'd like to talk to you about.
Be nicer to your mom when she calls.
Stop giving yourself high fives.
Put your head underwater, you two-year-old.
Be nicer to Coach, or he's gonna take off, live with a bunch of other white people.
(bad accent):
I no fake karate.
I'm Nick, I'm grumpy.
I'm going to put my baby hood on.
Sex is a sprint, not a marathon.
♪ You are special, you are special ♪
♪ You... ♪
We'll see each other in the future...
unless I see you first. Nick Miller!
Thank you guys for joining me on this momentous day.
As you guys know, it's been kind of a rough year for me.
I got dumped by Caroline, then Julia.
I opened myself up to love, I was hurt badly, and I closed myself up again.
The downstairs neighbor put a password on their Wi-Fi...
Off topic. Off-putting.
Okay. I agree.
So I've decided...
to give up on women, and put all that energy into...
tomatoes!
You know what? It was on us for thinking this wasn't gonna be stupid.
Thank God! I thought he was trying to sell us something.
Guys, I have a whole speech!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you guys.
I told him not to lead with tomatoes, but he did.
As his friends, don't you want to know why he wants to plant tomatoes?
Is it because he wants tomatoes?
This is my feeble attempt at a new beginning.
He's sowing the seeds for a more fruitful tomorrow.
He is turning over a new leaf. He is...
Jess, please don't do plant metaphors right now.
Okay, I'll trim it back a little bit.
Okay, but you did it again.
It's just ripe with plant metaphors.
Okay, but stop.
I'm looking at you guys, and I'm realizing that there's a possibility of happiness.
He's looking for a little dapple of sunlight.
Go.
Sorry.
Winston and Shelby, you guys have obviously found love, so...
No, you have no idea.
No, I do, 'cause you talk about it all the time.
I think we all have a pretty good idea.
Pretty clear idea.
Schmidt and Cece, you almost made a baby together.
You almost made a person. Think about that!
Jess...
you're dating the man that I could see myself growing old with.
Russell, you got a great-looking face.
Your jawline could cut glass.
Hold on tight, sister.
Don't let that one slip away.
It's getting a little weird, Nick.
So, without further ado...
Water, the source of life.
Whoa!
(everyone groaning, grumbling
(everyone groaning, grumbling It's okay, I got two of them.
You know what?
Go downstairs, if you want!
I don't care!
I got the tomatoes and I'm bettin' on me!
Freeze frame!
When I'm up in the air and the legs are there.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪
Cece, the Jewish is here to make sex.
Uh, it's actually Schmidt.
Um, we've met, uh, many times.
Right. I hear you make sex through Cece wall.
You sound like dog being stepped on.
Any noises I make, they come from a very truthful place.
I like to create a free environment in the sack.
Hey.
What's going on here?
I like his face.
I want to punch, punch, punch!
Beautiful women...
you guys can say just about anything, can't you?
So what are you doing here? So, look, we've barely spoken since I almost impregnated you.
You know, it's just, it's this whole thing has just kind of got me thinking.
Maybe this is just too intense, and we should stop.
That's what you want?
It's how I feel right now, so, yeah.
Oh... Coolio.
So he goes out with me.
Oh, Nadia, I think that...
I think that's a great idea.
I mean, that's what you want, right?
Yeah. It's great. Totally cool with me.
Yay! We have fun.
I make him put on black shawl, pretend he's grandma.
Fine, twist my arm.
I'll go out with the hot Russian model whose ancestors probably b*rned down my ancestors' village.
Something weird happened to me today.
I was at Russell's gym, and I ran into his ex-wife Ouli.
Jess, hi!
Ouli!
Oh, that's a great swimsuit.
Thank you.
Wow, someone's been working out.
You back's like a bag of ropes.
Oh, mama.
It was really foggy and I kept making eye contact with her nipples, and then I panicked and I invited her to dinner with Russell and me tonight.
What?
You did what?!
It's just that, like, Ouli is like this looming presence, and we don't talk about it, and I don't know, I thought it would be, like, good for us.
Everything okay with Russell?
Everything's fine.
I know it's gonna be tense at first,
'cause Ouli's no Russell's favorite person, but I grew up with divorced parents, and I'm really good at navigating these situations.
What did I do?
Nothing!
♪ Mommy's all right ♪
♪ Daddy's all right ♪
♪ They just seem a little weird ♪
♪ Surrender, surrender... ♪
Don't tap-dance at dinner.
Do you really think I would tap-dance at dinner?
Yes. I'm hiding your tap shoes, Jess.
Absolutely.
I'm with Schmidt. Don't do it.
Hi.
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
Hi!
Hi!
Hey, remember last time we were hugging?
You were naked.
That was weird.
No!
No, that's not weird at all.
I have no problem being naked.
Hi.
Hi.
How are the "quethadillath"?
You know what? I've actually never had them.
Oh, the eye roll.
Mm. Miss that.
I didn't actually roll my eyes.
I just needed to quickly stare at the ceiling.
Hey, Ouli...
Mm...
I love your name.
Thank you.
Or should I say, "grathiath"?
Uh...
Oh.
Well, this is fun.
Yeah.
It is.
Should we get, like, eight more of these, right?
I love this song.
Oh, I hate this song.
When we were on vacation in Oaxaca, Ouli hummed this song for, like, an eight-hour drive.
Well, it wouldn't have been eight hours if you hadn't gotten lost.
At one point, we were just following some donkeys.
Oh, my gosh! Look, it's food!
I love food.
They were not donkeys!
I can't even remember what we were talking about.
It wasn't a road.
For the millionth time, just because a road's not on a map, doesn't mean it's not a road!
Inside voice.
You know what means it's not a road?
When there are guys in t*nk telling you to turn around.
Oh, come on! Those were two kids in a jeep!
Car gets stuck in the mud, and no, you could not move it, Oh, here it is.
Because, God forbid, you break a nail!
I got one manicure, one time!
I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this!

♪ They just seem a little weird ♪
♪ Surrender, surrender... ♪
I'm leaving.
You mean before you get your "quethadillath"?
That's it.
It was crazy.
There was, like, serious heat between them.
Does she still have feelings for him?
Maybe...
Hey, Schmidt.
What up?
So, Nadia's excited for your date tonight.
I bet.
Make sure, uh, you use protection.
She's a foreigner, Cece.
What, do I look like an idiot?
Seriously, she doesn't even know where she's been, all right?
What, are we at Santa's family reunion?
'Cause the "clawses"
are coming out.
The-the "claws" are coming out? You know...
You're being catty, Cece.
Are you gonna let him go out with Nadia?
She was kicked out of Russia, Cece. Russia.
Come on, why don't you just tell him you like him?
It doesn't matter if I like him.
It's over.
And you're fine with that?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.
Hold up. Are you?
I am gonna k*ll you.
But are you?
Hey, Nick...
What?
Have you seen Shelby's cat Rummikub?
I mean, he is the cutest.
Just the absolute cutest.
All right, take a look at this picture where he woke up on my face.
Can't even see my face.
I look like a cat man.
No! No! Get out of here, birds!
Please get out of here, you sky rats!
Go back to Hell, where you belong!
Leave me and my plants alone!
I need this!
You know who loves birds?
Please don't say it, Winston.
Shelby.
So...
How do you like America?
I like salad bar.
I like Despicable Me.
Tosh 2.0.
I like Connect 4, freedom of speech, David Fincher, uh... sidewalk.
I like 1-800-SLIM.
"Your Mama" jokes.
Strawberry.
Wilmer Velmavelma.
Leon J. Panetta.
Ice skating for fun, not to save life.
What are you laughing at?
Cheese. Is for mouse.
Are you Mick Mouse?
Am I what?
Why don't you get in your spaceship like Mick Mouse?
What are you talking about?
Mick Mouse.
What is a Mick Mouse?
Mick Mouse!
I don't understand what Mick Mouse is!
Mick Mouse!
I don't under... I don't...
What does that mean? What's a Mick Mouse?
Mick Mouse!
Are you saying Mickey Mouse?
Yes.
In America, honey, okay, Mickey Mouse, he's earthbound.
Let's do sex party.
I sex you in face.
You're gonna sex me in my face?
Well, fancy meeting you here.
Hi.
What's up?
Love the gym.
You and Russell, huh?
Oh... God.
Last night?
Sorry.
If we made you feel uncomfortable.
We just can't be in the same room without wanting to rip each other's faces off.
Yeah... yeah.
Well, as long as it's, like, you know, faces and not, like... clothes.
You don't think...
No.
I'm just... it's my endorphins,
'cause I'm just, like, so high on endorphins.
Yeah, because there's not a chance in hell.
I mean, he is all yours.
All yours.
Awesome.
I mean, you know what it's like with Russell.
Yeah.
Yeah!
I mean... It's this roller coaster.
It's like standing on the bow of a catamaran blasted with spray during a perfect storm.
But you're...
naked and...
and you're on f*re.
You know?
Yeah. I do.
Whoo!
I'm just, like, "Russell, put away the passion."
And...
show me a moderately good time.
Yeah.
Crazy.
So crazy.
It's crazy.
Russell.
Hey!
What?
What's with all the hammering?
Whoa! What the hell is this thing?
This thing is creepy.
Yeah, it's called a scarecrow, okay?
Birds keep coming after my plants.
Whatever you're doing, just... stop with the hammering, okay?
Because me and Shelby are downstairs, right now, trying to make love.
Ugh! Did you honestly just say that?
Well, dude, we're making love, man. It's beautiful.
Who have you become, man?
I'm happy. Am I not allowed to be happy?
You're allowed to be happy, but it's really annoying, the way you're doing it.
You know what I don't care about?
Mm-hmm?
Shelby.
Oh, Shelby loves puzzles.
Oh, Shelby loves donuts, but hates donut holes.
Why are you hating on Shelby so much?
I used to be your Shelby!
That came out wrong.
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was my fault that your life sucks and you're so miserable.
Look at yourself! You look like one of those guys who crawls out of the grave in the "Thriller" video.
I want you to git.
Seriously?
I want you to git off my farm!
This is a little weird, man.
You used to be my best friend. Now, I don't know! - Talk to yourself, man.
So git!
I'm gitten!
I don't need ya!
Shut up!
Hey, Russell.
Mm-hmm.
Do I ever drive you crazy?
Of course not.
Come on. There has to be something that I do that just, like... gets under your skin.
No, I can't think of anything.
Come on, Russell. Think.
Think, think, think, think.
Thin-k.
That's annoying, right, the way I say, "Think"?
Well...
With a "K."
Okay, Jess, um...
Your eyes bug out a little when you're trying to make a point.
Yeah?
Yeah. And you do this, uh, squatting thing when you're thinking sometimes.
Yeah?
Yeah. Don't love that.
Like that? Like that?
Uh...
Yeah, and I've never actually seen both of those things together, so it's not a favorite of mine.
Is this just driving you crazy?
Um...
No, but it's not pleasant.
You're not pleasant.
You're not pleasant.
That's not nice, that's-that's...
Yeah.
Not nice.
No, it's passion!
Oh! You hurt my teeth.
Yeah, what you gonna do about it, Russell?
Uh, well, I mean, probably nothing.
You know, I hate this shirt, I hate this shirt.
Okay. Okay, you know, well could you please... thank you.
There it is. There's the f*re.
Where you been hiding it, Rusty? Where you been hiding it?
I'm gonna, um, make some tea.
Do you want some tea? We have chamomile.
No!
Okay. I mean...
oolong... oolong, you want oolong?
Ugh, I hate that you have so many coasters! Why?
Well, it's actually kind of a funny story... - Yeah?
Wow. - You just coasting through life, you coaster? - This isn't good, not at all. What are you...
You know, now-now I'm pissed. What is this?
Something's missing.
I didn't know it until I saw you and Ouli together the other night almost strangle each other.
But then it clicked.
I want that.
I want what you and Ouli have.
You want me to treat you like my ex-wife?
Who I hate?
I don't know, I just...
You guys have this spark, and I want that spark!
You have to admit, you have this spark, this passion.
Passion's overrated, Jess.
I knew we shouldn't have gone to that dinner, I...
I want to go home.
Jess... Just... can you just take me home?
Get in there!
Useless.
You... get... in there.
What is this, Martin Scorsese's
The Wizard of Oz?
I'm sorry about what happened on the roof, man.
Apology accepted.
It's just... we used to be miserable together, man.
We did have some pretty bad times together.
Had the worst.
Hey, remember that time we pooled our money and bought that online dating profile together?
Yes.
The ladies did not care for Ninston Biller.
Zero dates.
Zero.
I'm sorry that I can't be happier for you.
I don't really know what's wrong with me, Winston.
You want me to tell you?
Not really, actually.
Okay, why are you giving up?
If something doesn't work out, what do you do?
You make an adjustment, you give it one more sh*t.
I mean, that's what I did with...
Okay, just say it.
...My beautiful Shelby.
Shelby.
See, why did you say,
"my beautiful Shelby"?
It's so weird.
Look, man, I just called her out of the blue, okay?
And then... I was a different person, and she was a different person. Now look at us, man.
We're eating sandwiches and making love to one another.
Sandwiches and sex?
I want that.
Hey.
How, um... how was your date last night?
Brief. Small man go to hospital.
The hospital?
Is he okay?
I don't know.
I leave him there, I go make bowling.
Nadia... like, honestly, what did you do to him?
Well, he cry and cry. It was so funny.
Oh, my God.
There's me!
I really like what we have. I thought you did, too.
I do. I did. It's just, Russell...
Great. Just forget it.
Yeah, that seems to happen every time you're in this car.
But there's so many buttons. It's like...
The Batmobile doesn't have so many buttons.
Look, Jess, I've already done the crazy, expl*sive passion thing.
When I was with Ouli, it was like edging closer and closer to a wood chipper.
I'm not looking for that any more.
I understand.
But I am.
And...
I want passion...
even if it's harder and hurts more.
So that's it.
Good-bye, Russell.
Well...
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
How do you look this good under fluorescent lights?
I am so, so sorry.
Okay? This is all my fault. I thought...
What happened?
Yeah, um... this is embarrassing.
I broke my penis.
You what?
I broke my penis.
Things got... I mean, just out of control with Nadia last night.
And there was like this one moment where it was just blinding pain.
And then there was another moment where I was like watching myself watch myself...
I think I finally understand what The Tree of Life is about.
And I can't be certain of this, but I'm almost positive that Nadia's vag*na contains a right angle.
I'm leaving. I cannot believe I came here.
How are you upset right now?
Cece, you ended this.
I don't know what you want from me!
I don't want you sleeping with Nadia.
Are you crazy? I don't want you sleeping with anyone.
Because I like you.
I can't just always say what I feel, okay?
It's just...
Just, whatever, Schmidt.
You like me.
You like my personality?
I was surprised, too.
Come here.
Oh!
Oh!
What happened?
Oh, my God, why?
Oh, what?
Oh, my God, my penis is having a heart att*ck.
Don't touch me, don't touch me.
Okay. I...
You gotta get out of here.
All right.
I mean, I'd-I'd like... don't bend over!
For crying out loud! What are you, nuts?
I'm sorry, it's the yoga pants.
I'm sorry for this, but I...
I like you.
And I like you, too, so much.
Call a nurse, call a male nurse.
Probably a heavy-set male nurse would be nice.

Are you crazy?
Are you burning incense?
Yes, I am, for ambiance. She digs it.
She digs it?
Are you kidding, Nick? What happened?
What happened to swearing off women and focusing on tomatoes?
I can't grow tomatoes, Jess.
I think this is what was supposed to happen all along.
Me and Caroline. And I'm okay with it.
I'm happy.
That is pathetic, Nick. You're just saying that
'cause you don't have the patience or the courage to be alone.
I will never get used to those urinals.
Hey, would you give me a second? I have to talk to Jess for...
Oh. Sure.
Great.
Okay.
Bye, Caroline.
Bye.
See you in one second. What is your problem?
Have fun making terrible life decisions!
Oh, you just know everything, don't you?
No, I don't...
I'm actually so sick of you.
I'm just really disappointed in you.
You know, maybe I'll be more like you, Jess, and I'll go run into the kitchen and make pastries with sprinklies on them, That isn't what I do.
Then throw some dumb pajama outfit on, and then tell other people how to live their lives!
It's not a pajama outfit!
They're called pajamas!
That's what I said!
Nick, why don't you go back in your room and put on your stupid flannel and keep not living up to your potential!
You're a crazy person, Jess!
I am not, I'm just saying things that you don't want to hear.
You know what I would like to hear from you?
What?
Silence!
Well, I'm not gonna be silenced!
Just shut up! For one second be quiet!
I'm trying to help you!
Please be quiet!
No! No!
I don't want your help.
Stop making that face at me. I hate that face.
This is my only face! I don't have a lot of faces, and if you don't like looking at my face, Jess...then look at my ass!
Oh!
Yeah! Get a good look!
Stop shaking your ass at me, you quitter.
This is the ass of a failure.
You get a look.
Look right at my ass.
No, Nick.
You bought the ticket, take a ride.
Feast your eyes on my butt.
I'm winning this moment.
You quitter. - Look at my butt, it's going faster than yours!
I have the fastest butt in the land.
I got a faster one!
No, you don't.
What are we doing?
Stop looking at my ass.
Oh, I'm gonna k*ll you.
Quitter!
You really think Nick is gonna believe that a tomato just sprung up overnight?
Yes, I do.
When it comes to tomatoes, no one in the world knows less than Nick.
So how long you gotta ice that thing?
Eight weeks.
I mean, if I have any excitement it's excruciating pain.
Boobies.
What?
Boobies.
I love boobies...
Girls with clean hair. - Winston, this is the least funny game we've ever played.
Models eating sliders.
Bernadette Peters on a high beam.
Freshly baked bread.
Oh God.
But you're using birth control, right?
Yeah, of course.
It's just that Schmidt gets so athletic that birth control becomes like one of those plastic barbecue covers in a hurricane.
I didn't want to know that.
Okay, the pregnancy test doesn't work until after six days, so just get through the weekend and don't tell Schmidt until you're sure.
Yeah, no, of course not, of course.
It's just...
I can't stop thinking about what a Schmidt baby would be like.
Just, I mean, I, I don't know.
Would it just want to nurse 24 hours a day?
Probably.
We could make it, like, a douche baby jar.
(chuckles)
(gasps)
Oh, my God.
SCHMIDT:
Ladies, ladies, what is all the screaming about?
Oh, my... Jess, have you finally agreed to be our third?
Because, you know, we've discussed this.
We have never talked about that, Schmidt.
What? Schmidt, this is not the time.
Schmidt, we were just thinking about what you might have been like as a baby.
Oh, I was the b*mb diggity as a baby.
I mean, I was, I was, like, break-dancing at eight months old.
But they say that I needed a magnum size diaper.

Cece's resting.
Hey, guys, um, listen up.
Uh, Sarah is going to be here in a few minutes, so best behavior.
Who's Sarah? Russell's daughter, so no F-b*mb, P-b*mb.
Actually, no "B" through "S"
b*mb, no b*mb, and no bringing home college girls, Berlusconi.
(chuckles) Hey, that's not fair.
The girl I've been hanging out with is totally mature and interesting.
Please put on some pants.
Everything you say sounds really creepy when you're not wearing pants.
Your hair looks nice.
BOTH: Ugh.
Mmm, this coffee is smoldering.
So creepy.
So what's with the babysitting?
I think he's actually testing me.
I think he's seeing if I can be a mom.
Are you nervous?
It's nothing I can't handle.
I'm halfway there... I'm already her teacher, so...
(phone chirps)
Oh, she's here.
Um, Nick, uh, put on some pants or at least some really high socks.
High socks it is.
Hi, Ms. Day.
Hi, Sarah.
I can be here in under five minutes if I need to be.

Honestly I wouldn't have agreed to this, except my husband is out of town, and you're Sarah's favorite teacher and my husband's favorite teacher.

Um, hey, um, I hope this doesn't sound rude, but, um, you keep saying
"husband"
and I just want to make sure you and Russell...
you're not still married?
(laughing):
Oh... no, no.
(both laughing)
'Cause I just, like, wanted to make sure there wasn't some very important piece of information that I totally missed.
No, I mean, but he'll always be my husband, if you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Actually, could you explain what you mean very clearly?
Cece's acting really weird.
Do you think she's getting tired of me?
I mean, look, it's been, like, months of non-stop sex.
I mean, what can I do if she doesn't let me h*t the fifth chakra?
I'm not listening to you.
I'm just, I'm just saying, look, do you think she wants something more than sex? (phone ringing)
Do you think she's finally becoming a girl?
'Cause I can't handle that, man.
Hey, boss. What are you doing?
Hmm?
Look...
W-W-Wait, n-n-no, yesterday you said noon, but it's only 10:30.
Do you think that I've become too dependent on a hot lava massage?
Hmm?
I'm gonna be there in just a second.
What about costumes?
I got to go, bye.
Do you think I made her dress up too much?
Look, man, I'm not going to sit here and bond with you about this, all right?
I got to go babysit my boss.
JESS: Hey, Schmidt, you gonna stay for dinner?
We're going to borrow your pasta maker.
Oh, that's great, are you gonna teach Sarah your recipe for overcooked mush?
JESS: Ha, ha, no, I'm teaching her about Italy.
NICK: I'm coming with a date...
Chloe. Uh, no, you're not.
You are not bringing any of those girls around Sarah.
Hey, you must be Sarah.
And you guys are wrong about Chloe. Okay, Chloe is smart and she's mature and she knows about art and famous artists like Banksy and the guy who did the Obama poster and, you know, like, Chalk Outline Guy.
That's stupid.
Your eyes are so brown.
They look like poop.
Be honest with me... do my eyes look like poo?
There's a bit of a, a poopy-ish hue.
Old poo eyes.
(Sarah laughs)
(sighs)
Oh, hey.
I like your house.
It's not my house!
Go, go!
What?
(speaking Cambodian)
Go!
(tires screeching)
(yelling in Cambodian)
What's going on?
What are you talking about, man?
I'm sweating spicy ban hoaw, wearing a Cambodian woman's shoes.
What do you think is going on? I don't know, I'm just trying to give you an opportunity to lie to me, Joe, just trying to be polite.
Actually, the ancient Egyptians made pasta by flattening the dough with their feet.
Cool, huh?
Sarah?
Hey.
(chuckles)
Why do you have so many bras?
You're a teacher.
Teachers need bras, too.
You know, like, all that erasing and stuff.
It's like...
That's an after-
school bra.
Can I get out of doing homework because you're dating my dad?
No.
Um, hey, I know having your teacher dating your dad is weird, um, but I just want you to know that, um, you can ask me anything.
Really?
Yeah, anything.
Are you in love with my dad?
Hmm... oh...
Do you and my dad ever dry-lump?
G... uh...
Is sexting cool?
What? No, it's not cool.
Have you done a 99?
I think that's a tax form.
Have you ever given anyone plow jobs?
I don't know.
How do you make love to a person animal-style?
Do you want to learn how to play bridge?
SCHMIDT:
I've been doing some thinking, and
I think it's time that I take you on a real date.
You're asking me out on a date?
Yeah, it'll be our first real date.
Now, Italy on Ice is a celebration of all things Italian featuring ice dancing's biggest and brightest Italian stars.
Drea de Matteo is scheduled to appear, but, you know, they're not liable if she doesn't.
I can't go right now.
It's a really bad time, okay?
I'm sorry, just take someone else.
You mean, like another girl?
Yeah, Schmidt, that's what this is.
That's the deal.
Just take someone else, okay?
All right, yeah, sure, yeah, I'll just...
I'll ask somebody else, I'll just... yeah, totally, and with these VIP tickets I got... poppacorno.
What?
Poppacorno.
Poppacorno.
It's "popcorn"
in Italian.
I don't think you should be rushing into these things.
You need to look for a partner who is...
Ew, you said "partner."
I know, that sucked.
I'm sorry.
Look, as your friend Jess, not Ms. Day, just choose someone who makes you laugh.
Like Nick?
Yeah, I mean... wait, what?
Oh, my God, oh, my God, I love Nick so, so, so much.
He's so hot.
That Nick?
I want to rub my face on his face.
(moans)
Just to be clear, I am dialing another woman to go see Italy on Ice right now.
CECE:
That's fine, do it.
Hey, guys, not now.
Oh, it's ringing.
Don't care.
This room cannot take any more hormones.
I love the juxtaposition of high-brow literary with low-brow youth culture.
It's almost too much juxtaposition for me.
You know what I mean?
It's, like, right up to the line of juxtaposition, but I think I'm gonna let it slide.
(ringtone playing)
Hey, I got to... yes.
You've got Nick.
Hey, Nick-ole.
What it be, girl?
What's going on, Schmidt?
What you got going on, ma?
It's the freakin' weekend.
Did you just call me "girl"?
Are you wearing something sexy?
Just, you know, button-down and jeans like always.
Oh, you got jeans on, baby, are they tight?
Hmm, they're a little loose;
I buy 'em big.
Oh, them jeans sound sexy.
Everything all right? You want to hang out more, Schmidt?
You taking care of that tushy... taking care of that tushy for me?
I'm not doing, like, squats or anything.
I'm trying to eat less doughnuts.
You still keeping it tight?
You're an idiot.
What?
I thought this is what you wanted.
JESS: This is a really good example of people who should not be making love.
Have fun.
Cece, are you okay?
Damn it!
SARAH: You don't understand... I love Nick so, so, so much.
He's so hot, I'm going to die.
Sarah, Nick is way too old for you.
I live with him.
He is dirty and weird.
No, no, no, no...
Sarah, not Nick's room.
It's not well ventilated in there.
Let's see, we'll get there a little early, maybe get you in the shower, maybe a once-over with some disinfectant.
Hmm... hey.
Yard sale... pull over.
(chuckles)
No.
Someone rich d*ed, I can smell it.
Okay, look, Joe, I'm trying to get you to the show on time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
I'll push you out of the car, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, yeah, yeah, baby, yard sale, yeah.
Oh, I feel so alive.
Aah, I got a charley horse.
Oh, God.
Hey, Sarah.
Can you come out of Nick's room?
I'm going to roll in his dirty clothes.
Jess, Schmidt asked me out.
Oh.
Like, he came over and he asked me out, and I really can't go on a date with him right now.
Okay...
(Cece and Sarah talking)
Sarah! I've had enough of this little...
Shh! - Listen to me, listen to me, all right, you little brat, you just need to be quiet because I need my friend to focus on me right now!
(whispering):
What are you doing, Cece?
You know how much this means to me.
Don't let your dysfunction rub off on her.
I am going to be a terrible mother.
No, no, no, shh.
A terrible mom!
I'm gonna be just like my mother.
You're gonna be a great mom.
You're gonna be a fashionable mom.
I can make this right, okay?
Just...
Sarah?
Hey, Sarah.
Um, look, you should definitely not be having sex right now at this age, but when you do, just make sure you always use protection because, even if he says it's tantric and you're Indian and you know better, you're just going to end up pregnant anyways.
SCHMIDT:
What?
Cece, are you pregnant?
SARAH: Whoa!
Sarah, Nick has one tie.
See if you can find it.
CECE: No, okay, I don't know.
We have to wait for the test results, but I'm late.
Oh, my...
We made a caramel miracle.
(laughing):
You pregnant, you pregnant.
Oh, my God.
You got Cece pregnant?
We used protection. I don't know how this happened.
Think she did it on purpose?
An Indian-Jewish baby... who wouldn't want that? Think about the bone structure.
Okay, I'm not ready to be a godparent.
Don't ask.
No one's asking you.
Phew, good.
I'm not into being an uncle.
You're not my brother!
Okay, Schmidt, are you sure you're okay about this?
'Cause I'm freaking out by the fact that you're not freaking out!
Yeah, I'm oddly calm about the whole thing.
Look, Nick, maybe this isn't exactly in my five-year plan, but maybe this is fate.
You know, maybe I h*t the jackpot.
Maybe this is the universe telling me that I'm never gonna find a girl better than Cece.
By, the way, I'm-I'm Schmidt.
Chloe. Mazel tov on your news.
Oh, my God, finally, Nicholas.
You bring home a nice girl.
Right?
So... that was crazy what happened with my friends, right?
I liked it.
Your life's like
Gossip Girl,
only everyone is old and poor.
You know, there actually was a show like that.
It was called Golden Girls.
I'm Betty White, Schmidt's Rue McClanahan...
Don't you think Nick is hot?
Nick? Um... yeah, in a rumpled, small-town P.I. kind of way.
What's he like in the morning?
Do his eyes get sleepy?
Does he love stuff?
I want to love what he loves.
Do you think that we'll ever do animal style?
Four minutes! We eat in four!
I made you a mocktail.
Cece, are you crying?
No. No. (sniffles)
No. I-I... I just... I don't... I don't know.
You're an amazing woman, and you're going to do and be so many things in this life.
Maybe you'll be a mom, and maybe... maybe not.
But I will support you no matter what.
Thank you.
I also just want to give you a quick heads up.
I'm probably going to be going on the internet before we have sex again, because I-I just... I don't want to impregnate the baby, you know?
I mean, we could have a Russian nesting doll situation on our hands.
(loud munching, fork scrapes plate)
So, Sarah and I learned to use the pasta maker today, which was cool.
Are you and Nick making love?
Hmm?
Who wants seconds? That's my question.
Yeah, I would love seconds, Jess. That'd be great.
If you're a boy, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna name you Mordecai, or Abraham, Menachem Menandel, Schmerson.
Hey! I'm watching you.
Well, time for dessert.
No, please don't get up. I will take care of it.
Oh, thank you. That's so thoughtful.
See? Thoughtful and mature.
In your face! Yes!
Congratulations. You're dating a girl with basic table manners.
You win. Why don't you get on her health care plan?
(bl*wing raspberries)
SCHMIDT:
I'm so excited to take this journey with you.
I mean, your boobs are gonna be unbelievably enormous.
JESS:
Sarah, do you want to go help Chloe with the dessert? I hate her.
Oh, come on, you don't hate her.
You don't know her well enough to hate her.
Yes, I do! I know her.
She used to ride on my school bus.
No, no, no, that's...
What?
Oh, my God, that's why you look so familiar!
You were that crazy little kindergartner who had, like, the imaginary friends.
Oh.
You're the skank with the skank face.
Sarah, I know you're trying to look cool in front of you you know who...
What?! You told him?!
No! I did not tell him.
You just told him!
Oh, my God, Jess!
(door slams, Jess sighs)
What are you saying?
When was the last time you were on a school bus?
Last year.
How old are you?
18.
(groaning)
JESS:
Hey, you know what, Chloe?
I actually think I subbed for your eighth grade English class.
That's right! Hi, Miss Day!
Hi.
(Nick groans)
Well, it's a good thing I got you an extra shirt, 'cause...
(grunts)
Whoa! Joe, Joe!
Where you going? Where you going? Wait.
Where are you going? Uh, sorry about this, man.
Hey, don't make me chase you! Do not make me chase you!
Joe, come back.
(coughs)
(thudding)
(grunts)
Oh! Are you okay?
Leave me alone.
So, come on, man. What's up?
Michael Strahan makes me feel like an idiot.
Okay? I mean, he thinks he's better than me.
He wins the Super Bowl, and suddenly, he's the best at everything.
What's he better than you at? Huh?
Marriage, probably. Money management, I would say.
Probably he's better than you at that.
Well...
He's not better than you at yard sales.
He's good at yard sales.
Yeah, but he's not better than you.
So here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna walk into that studio, and you're gonna show him the Napoli that I saw today.
The one that I saw grabbed seven copies of Speed on VHS at a yard sale for a fraction of the retail price.
When's the last time Strahan did that?
Boom. You're not gonna let him win.
Yeah. You know, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
You're gonna do it?
That guy's a b-hole. He's a b-hole!
You know what? If you were a woman, or even dressed as a woman, man, we'd be unstoppable.
Mm, mm.
18 years old. She was 18 years old.
She doesn't even know what Netscape is.
Thinks of Ice Cube as mainly an actor.
This is a disaster! Ouli's downstairs.
She just called me. She wants to be let up.
Sarah's in my room, because she fell in love with you for some unknown reason.
I might as well call you
Bridge to Terabithia,
because you make children cry.
And you... I might as well call you
Indian In the Cupboard because you put an Indian in Ce... Never mind.
I will not apologize for my powerful sperm.
Why are young girls in love with me? I look like an old man.
Shut up, both of you!
We're gonna fix this, 'cause I'm not losing Russell because you two have to make and/or date babies.
You... go stall Ouli.
Try not to get her pregnant.
You... come with me and get Sarah out of my room. Now!
I gonna go do Ouli.
Yeah, I'm gonna go do this.
Yeah. All right.
Ouli?
Yeah.
Oh, my God, it's-it's Schmidt.
How are you?
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.
Great.
Yeah. Havasu.
'99. I was on the boat, remember?
No.
We were just... We were part... Yeah. I...
Winter Olympics. Uh-huh.
No.
2006.
Bobsled.
Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better.
SARAH:
No! No, I never will.
I can be a bit of an anchor.
I've been known to drag women down.
That is true.
(whispers): Save me.
What? This is so entertaining.
Okay, Jess, honestly, help me.
I don't know what to do. All right.
Okay, just tell her something about life or something.
Hey, Sarah?
Sarah, I haven't loved somebody the way you love me in a very long time, and I miss that feeling.
The feeling you have is good. It's just misplaced.
It's better than being numb your whole life.
You end up doing such weird things.
You know what? Just stay in there.
It's not that great out here.
Stay in there as long as you can.
He's kidding, Sarah.
You should definitely, definitely come out.
Oh, my God. The Melman funeral?
No. - We were both sitting next to...
to Un... Un-Uncle Jack?
Yeah, sure.
I don't know Uncle Jack or Mel...
Oh, my... I used to do your hair in Tribeca.
Sarah? Sarah, please come out.
Sarah, please.
I can't come out. I'm too embarrassed.
In front of us? We are literally the most embarrassing people on the planet.
Trust me. - Yeah, you don't have to be embarrassed around us.
Sometimes I talk louder to blind people.
I'm 30 years old, and I've peed in every pool I've been into.
Every single one.
Ew.
I originally grew these bangs
'cause I hate my forehead.
I still think it's funny when I guy puts tennis b*lls under his shirt and pretends it's boobs.
(muffled laugh)
They look like little boobs.
I know.
Come on, Sarah!
Look, I do so many stupid things.
You don't even know.
I mean, like, falling for your dad.
That was... so crazy, and I understand why you're confused.
I'm confused.
SARAH:
I'm not confused. I'm stuck.
What? Oh, my God.
Oh. I don't know how to get them off.
Okay. Oh, okay. I'll get the front.
I'll get the back.
Hey, hey, guys, she's coming.
Ouli's coming. I failed.
I failed. I'm sorry. Uh...
Hi, Ouli. Um...
Who is the man taking the bras off my daughter?
There is a God! I've got my period!
It's so amazing! Oh, my God.
Mmm. I got my period.
(Cece laughs)
She got her period.
So happy!
Welcome to our home. Would you like a drink?
You have a beautiful daughter and a beautiful ex-husband.
I mean...
Bye, Nick.
I'm kind of over you now.
Okay.
(Sarah sighs)
Thank you. - Thanks, Jess. I had a really great time.
Thanks, Sarah. Good-bye.
(whispering): Your mom doesn't have to know everything.
Heard that. Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks for coming by.
Oh, sure.
Bye, Sarah. See you at school.
Bye.
Bye, Ouli. You ruley.
Bye, Jess. You're a mess.
I'm not having kids... till I'm 80.
Now we can just go back to the way things were.
You can go on your date.
Right. Nicole, mm-hmm.
No more stupid mistakes, right?
Right.
(laughs)
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.
Go do your thing.
Yeah.
Oh, wait. Oh, okay.
Okay, Cece, let's just...
Yeah.
You know, there's a marathon downtown, and I don't want you to h*t the traffic. - Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
So let's just, head down.
That's very thought of you.
Don't h*t the top.
Okay. All right, you in, you in, you in? Good, okay.
Terrible car for a baby anyway.
(sighs)
(sighs)
Oh.
I never knew Italy was so much more than pizza, Schmidty.
It's so much more.
She's okay. You're awesome!
The reenactment of Pompeii really stays with you.
What a move!
Two shows a day. Two shows a day! How do they do it?
Hey, if you're play a gondolier, you better skate
like a gondolier.
You know, Schmidty? Here's this idea.
We should buy skaters.
Yeah!
(cheering)
Do something weird, Mussolini. We love you.

JESS: I love these parties.
I feel like I'm an ambassador, or a spy, or, like, a really high-class prost*tute.
Well, Jess, it's a political fundraiser.
Who's to say you can't be all three?
Hey, this is... really good.
I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm really, um...
Happy.
Happy.
It's like the complete opposite of my marriage.
I'll give you the opposite of your marriage.
What?
Sorry, I just...
I've never heard you talk about your ex-wife, and I got really nervous and...
I tried to flirt information out of you.
Aw...
So...
I haven't been home in a week, and, um...
underneath my dress, I'm wearing...
a pair of your boxer briefs that I borrowed slash-stole slash-I'm not giving them back.
Come on. Let's go. Go to my house right now.
Well, I have to go to my home for a bit.
No, no, come on.
Come on. Stay with me.
No, I'm worried about the guys.
They must really be missing me and wondering where I am.
Hey! Sacrifice, sacrifice, Lava! Touched the lava!
...sacrifice...
Touched the lava! Ow, ow! Touched the lava, dude!

MAN (on Radio):
He's the worst quarterback in the league, I mean, statistically, it would be better if he wasn't even playing, all right?
You're listening to the radio and writing with a pen?
What decade are we in?
NICK: I cannot listen to that guy.
Come on. Joe Napoli's the worst, man.
What? Man, that is blasphemous.
He's the king of sports radio, man.
I've got an interview with him today, okay?
He's hiring a new research assistant.
Hence... the research.
My old basketball coach set it up.
You know, I'm just trying to figure out how to break it to Elvin.
You gotta cut ties with that kid.
He freaks me out.
He never blinks.
He's like a tiny little owl in a shirt.
Hey, guys!
Hey. Hello. JESS: I have so much to tell you.
I spent the whole week with rich people.
I finally tried port.
Were you gone last week? Is that why it was so quiet?
I feel like I haven't seen you guys in so long.
You all look so handsome, so grown-up.
Thank you.
Hey, Nick.
I finally notice the one-eighth Cherokee.
Winston...
that's almost a mustache.
Yeah. It's creepy and thin, just like I like it.
How was your sexcation with Russell?
I did have a lot of sex. Thank you.
What'd you guys do without me? h*t me up with a headline!
Nothing. We played True American.
What?! You played True American without me? - Yes, ma'am.
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, sorry. It's Cece.
Hey, you!
Tell me everything. How's it going?
Where are you? CECE: With Schmidt.
Where are you?
Right here.
Wow.
I am not used to this yet.
I'm surprised this one's still standing.
We b*rned through a lot of ideas last night.
That's really great.
We went deep into the s*ab...
Yeah. Cool. NICK and WINSTON: Ugh.
I don't know. It's like we're living in a romantic comedy montage.
Like, we, like, throw our heads back when we laugh, and I, like, try on floppy hats for him.
It's pretty perfect.
It's like the first act of a TV movie until I find out that he has a wife and kids in another state.
Yeah, but nothing's perfect, right?
You're kind of doing everything on his terms, living in his beautiful, fancy house...
I'm not really living there.
Has he ever spent a night here?
Hey, guys.
So, listen, um...
Russell's gonna come and stay this weekend.
(groans)
I was just wondering if you guys could be cool?
Yeah.
Sure. JESS: Okay, uh...
Actually, I don't trust what
"cool" means to all of you, so how about we just say
"be normal"?
Big R.
Schmidt.
Your shoe's untied.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Label check, man.
What are you doing?
Label check.
What are you doing?
Just calm down.
(sighs)
Did...
(chuckles)
I got it.
(flushes)
Russell!
Whoa!
Oh, man, you scared me.
You scared of black people?
No.
It's 2012, baby.
I'm...
Yeah, of course. - Done deal.
Easy. - Of course.
Quick question.
Russell's such a visionary, would it be okay if I took him through my Idea Notebook?
Nope, not at all. - Maybe I won't take him through the whole notebook...
Or how about none of it?
But I have one that I'm really excited about called Real Apps, that I know Russell would be interested in.
No.
Nick, Real Apps is my idea.
Real Apps is not your idea.
SCHMIDT: Yeah, sure, you might have birthed the idea, but I midwifed it, and I midwifed the crap out of it.
Guys.
It was a messy birth.
NICK: You just thought of the name!
The name is everything.
The name is the name of the game.
The game is... is the name. The game is the name.
The product is the game.
Guys!
I know you can do this.
You sure you don't want to swing?
Nah. Pushing's where the action is.
(chuckles)
Elvin, listen, buddy. I think we should talk.
You know I'm not going to be here forever, right?
I know about death, Winston.
I know there's no farm where dogs and grandpas go.
What? No. It's just that I'm an adult.
It's time for me to get an adult job with adult people.
You understand, right?
Maybe we should get to work on your resume because yours is terrible.
It's 2012, Winston.
Typing is not a special skill.
And you're familiar with the show?
Yes, I am. I've been listening for years.
What do you think of Mr. Napoli?
He's actually like an idol of mine.
Be honest, jackass!
Would you consider yourself an undercover cop? - Huh?
Seriously. Are you a cop? You have to tell me. - No!
How far can you drag an unconscious man?
I don't know. I never really tried to... Hello, Mr. Napoli.
If you're as bad an assistant as you were a point guard, I'll eat you.
You know, I know you, Winston Bishop, okay?
Sub-par collegiate career, went to Latvia,
9% from the European-slash-
Women's 3-point line?
Okay, just...
Now you wind up in my lap.
Well, I'm the luckiest girl in school.
Hey, come on in, big guy. I want you to meet our new assistant, Winston Bishop.
Hey, first of all, I've not agreed to do it...
Welcome to the team, Winston.
Hope Joe hasn't been too tough on you.
I'm in. I'll do it.
Um...
So nice to meet you, Mr. Kareem Abdul Jabbar.
Can I sit on your shoulders?
Sure!
Really?
No.
Oh.
You've made a wonderful decision.
I'm sure you're going to learn a lot.
Kareem Abdul Jabbar.
NAPOLI: Yeah, well, welcome aboard. You can start today.
I want to Kareem about a segment on his show.
I want to talk to you about the jackets.
_
You said we were going to get show jackets!
Russell, hey.
I could show you around. I could show you our world.
Way up here, it's crystal-clear.
Nick, you're doing Aladdin.
Again?
Do you like cheeses, Russell?
What? That's...
Nick, come on.
It's for Russell.
So you really just call these "ethnic noodles"?
No, actually, I don't know.
The only English writing on the box is,
"Find water. Grow hot. Family celebrate plus."
That guy.
Nick, stop staring.
I'm not... what?
Schmidt's being really weird, too.
So I told you and Jess to go get some sushi at Asakune, but I hear you hara-kiri'd that one.
Well, I know the chef at Namuda.
Oh, oh. Namuda?
Maybe "My First Sushi."
Baby wants a tempura California roll.
Little Russell wants...
Little Wussell wants an avocwado roll!
JESS: Schmidt...! Nick, don't eat his noodles.
Yeah, but we're bowl brothers, now.
No, you're not.
Tighten up, guys. WINSTON: I'm gonna k*ll him.
I'm gonna punch him in his rich, old white dude face.
Not you.
Joe Napoli.
So I guess you didn't get the job?
No, I got the job. And that's the problem.
I want six shakes in my fridge at all times, ready to go.
And I want it Beyoncé-colored.
Not darker, not lighter.
Beyoncé!
Clean your damn desk!
(whispering):
Don't let him see you cry.
See, I want to k*ll him.
Russ, I was wondering if later, if you had a minute, if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my Idea Notebook.
Um... Hold that thought.
I will hold it.
Hold that thought 'cause he doesn't want to hear it, Nick.
Those ideas were 51% mine.
(garbage disposal rumbles, whines)
I got it, I got it! Russell, move, my man.
What'd I do?
No, you did nothing, my man. Don't blame yourself.
Yah! It just fights back a little bit, Russ.
(clattering)
Anchor me! Anchor me!
It's choking me! Come on. Go, go, go!
Come on!
(grunting)
Anchor me. Don't grope me.
Jess, get in there!
Jess!
NICK:
One more big one!
(groans)
(garbage disposal stops)
Oh, my God. Sorry.
RUSSELL:
You guys, my contractor knows a really great plumber. - Please.
I know the best plumbers in the business.
White guy knows a plumber.
Sorry. Plumbing's, like, a really sensitive topic around here.
I-I didn't know.
I mean, who would?
(chuckles)
Um...
hey...
who wants to play True American?
I'm in.
That sounds like a great idea.
JESS:
So it's 50%
drinking game,
50% life-size Candyland.
Well, it's more like 75 drinking,
20 Candyland, and by the way, the floor is molten lava.
It's actually 90% drinking, and it's got a loose Candyland-like structure to it.
JESS: Well, with steaks.
Hey, guys, we doing teams?
Yeah.
Ready?
One, two, three, go.
SCHMIDT: Two, two, four. WINSTON: Wow, I'm with Russell. Perfect.
What? You don't want to be on my team?
Well, I just copied you.
You haven't given me any information yet.
Oh, okay.
So it starts off there are four zones. An alternate zone is a crazy zone.
And there's a trail of chairs.
But the floor is lava.
These are the pawns. They're the soldiers of the secret order.
This is the king of the castle.
And remember, everything you hear in True American is a lie, knock on wood.
And it starts with a g*n tip-off, okay?
Oh, that I can do.
g*n, for sure.
Oh, yeah!
All right! Yeah!
(laughing)
Yeah! Yes!
Yeah, there's no going back now.
One, two, three, four, JFK!
FDR! Up, up, up! FDR!
(shouting)
Russell, you're in the lava, man.
I don't understand. Abe Lincoln, George Washington.
OTHERS:
Cherry tree!
(person whistles)
All right, Americans, you ready? Let's do the count.
ALL:
One, two, three.
That's me!
(others cheering)
Okay, remember:
The ground is lava.
OTHERS (chanting):
Russell! Russell!
Don't touch the lava. (cheering)
(laughs) NICK: Big R!
JESS:
Only thing we have to fear ALL:
Is fear itself!
Drink!
Drink!
(shouts unintelligibly)
(others shout unintelligibly)
(laughing)
Jimmy Carter... atop...
Grover Cleveland.
What now?
More beer.
More beer.
I got to get to the castle!
Go, Nick, go! Russell, you're kind of ripped up, huh?
Well, I used to work summers in a lumber camp near Banff, and I still split my own wood.
JFK! FDR!
You're pretty good at this, old-timer.
Ooh, ooh, Cece, this is the best game of True American ever.
I'm this close to winning.
I'm gonna go get in your bed.
Damn.
Yeah, I'm out.
Schmidt, no!
No!
Does it mean we win?
Yes, we win!
Whoo! (laughs)
(cheering)
BOTH:
USA! USA!
Oh, a little bit. Ah!
USA! USA!
RUSSELL:
I'm trashed.
I'm in a trash bag right now.
It's true.
I think we should call it a night.
No, no, hang on.
I was, I was saying something.
What you was saying to me. I remember.
Hey, guys, guys? I'm really sorry.
I'm on a water break.
It's over here.
Oh, man, you were giving me advice on my boss because you are also a rich white man. And that's okay.
Hell, yeah, I am!
(laughing)
Hey, I love ya.
. Russell, we have a big day planned tomorrow, so maybe we should...
Shh-shh, hang on a sec.
Let me straighten you out.
Here's what you do.
Your boss is power-playing you.
So you need to power-play him back.
Yes.
How do I do that?
Dip your boys in his shake.
What?!
That's all you gotta do.
Your testicles, dip 'em in, wring em out, dip it again and give him his shake. That's how you do it.
That's a terrible idea.
Jess, no, no. Shh.
Hang on. It's like a guy thing.
Territory. Jess, you don't know.
It's a guy thing, you know?
Jess doesn't get it. It's a territory...
Stop copying Russell.
I'm not copying him. I love him.
Classic is a classic, you know what I mean?
Just get in there, dunk your nuggets in his shake!
That's what I'm talking about.
Well, we all learned a lot.
You know what would make this night really great?
Idea Notebook.
Sleep.
Yeah?
Have you ever wanted to take a ride on a magic idea?
Well, strap on, Russell.
Russell, let's go to sleep.
I'll be in in a second.
I want to hear your idea.
Take one more of these, and then this idea's gonna be even better.
Okay.
Down the hatch!
(all groan)
Let's have a little bit more of that.
I'm mad at him, and I've never been mad at him before.
Oh, Jess!
This room is not a place of comforting, okay?
This is Darwin's jungle, where open-minded people do weird things to each other.
Go away.
Yeah.
I can't fight with him.
That's our thing. We don't fight.
He used to fight all the time with his ex-wife.
I think he likes that we're peaceful.
Fighting's good. It's healthy.
It's how you know it's working.
You know, Jess, what Cece and I like to do is we like to fight with our bodies.
It's like very intense game of Capture the Flag.
I won't make you guess what the flag is.
As my financial business partner, I appreciate you taking the time.
All right, Russell said we need a prototype.
So, Mr. Schmidt, I now present you "Real Apps."
The phone obviously goes back here where the phone goes, and then these are all the apps.
You've got a Zippo. You've got a fork.
You've got a spoon.
That's a corn holder.
It's also a gentleman's shiv.
Nick, it's a prototype of a prototype at best.
Let me see it.
No.
Don't be mean about it.
Come on, let me see it.
You got a bottle opener. - Come on.
Yeah. - Look at this.
There's no brushed steel, no nickel.
I mean, it's got none of the baller metals.
I mean, come on, man.
I'm not gonna get Winkelvossed because of your sloppiness.
What do you mean, "I"? Real Apps is my idea.
You just came up with the name!
Yeah, and the name is the game, friendo.
Mm-mm.
Yes, it is, man.
No, it isn't. No, it isn't, man.
Would you line up around the corner if they called the iPhone a "slippery germ brick"?
Yeah, actually, I might.
That's why they call it basketball and not "peach basket catch-it-up."
You just came up with that?
Hey, hey, we're back here on
the Joe Napoli Show, and let me
introduce you to a new member of the Joe Napoli Show family, and that is Winston Bishop, who is our new assistant.
I'll tell you what ... he's sharp as a tack.
Ladies, there's no ring on his finger, and, Winston, why don't you tell us just a little bit about yourself?
(goofy voice):
Hey, thanks, a lot, Joe.
I really want to tell you about myself.
You know, I been on the job two days, and I don't know how to make no milk shake.
Oh, and I played two years of mediocre Division I basketball. - Wow.
And why was that?
Well, because I really didn't know how to play basketball.
I got recruited for a girls' volleyball team.
All right, there he is. That's Winston Bishop.
And we'll see you again probably never.
All right, turning now to the NBA picture, it looks like the West...
These are hangover eggs.
See, they'll either stop you from throwing up the rest of the day or you'll just throw it up really fast.
It's high-risk, high-reward.
Oh, maybe I should just go back to bed.
I have a really nice day planned for us.
We're gonna go apple picking...
I don't... I don't pick apples.
That... that's... that's not gonna happen.
Are you serious?
Because it's picking and it's apple...
You're serious?
That literally sounds like hell.
Okay.
Are we in a fight?
We're not fighting.
This feels like a fight, Jess.
This is not a fight!
Russell, my man, it seems these days there's an app for everything.
Doesn't it, though?
Yeah, but there isn't.
Let's say I'm out and about, you know, being mobile, and I want to cut a bagel, cobble a shoe.
Haberdash on the fly.
Is there an app for that?
No. Is there?
Until now.
Right.
We now present to you...
Real Apps! Real Apps!
The prototype.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Relapse?
Real Apps.
Real Apps.
Relapse?
Relapse?!
Would you calm...?
You called my baby
"relapse"?!
No, I didn't call it anything. Just calm down!
I gave you 51% of this for Relapse?
Russell. Russell. Enough.
Russell...
Hold it in your hands, my man.
We're in the middle of something, guys. JESS: No, no, no.
We're great. We're fine. Show it to him, Schmidt. SCHMIDT: It's all right here.
Let me show it to you. NICK: Yeah, but you have to...
I want to... Russell.
You're going the wrong way.
Aah! Oh! Oh, oh, no!
Oh, my God, Russell, are you okay? NICK: No, no, no.
I've been s*ab!
It wasn't ready.
It wasn't ready.
You called it Relapse, idiot!
Where are the Band-Aids?
No Band-Aids! JESS: What?!
Ow! (panting)
I'll get you a takeout napkin with some Scotch tape.
Searing pain!
So sorry.
Here. Oh, sorry.
(groans) Ow! Ow! Jess.
Jess, do you know what? You just taped a napkin to my hand.
You know what? I'm gonna go.
I need to be home right now.
Is that a problem?
No.
I'm fine.
It's great.
We're great.
Yeah.
(mumbles)
I'm s...
Just nicked him.
(door closes)
(yells)
Get it all out.
I have an idea for your Idea book!
Replace the Band-Aids!
Very fair.
It's so sticky!
Oh, I have an app for that.
ELVIN:
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at your new job?
I'm quitting.
You're quitting your dream job?
Well, I mean, there's good news.
I want to keep being your nanny.
That's what I've come to tell your mom.
I can't let you do that.
Mom? Mom?
Winston just asked me if he can smoke weed.
What?!
What?!
No, see...
He said when we go to the park, he wanted to do it.
And I get to hold it because I'm a minor.
Where is your imagination taking you? No!
You said that in front of my kid?!
Gina...
Are you serious?!
Are you completely insane?!
Gina, you know me, okay?
I'm wearing a tie and everything.
You're never, ever gonna nanny again.
I will destroy you on the nanny boards.
You can count on that. Come on, Elvin. Just...
Let me explain. Let me... Elvin, Elvin, Elvin, hey, now.
Elvin, let's get away. Get away from the hippie.
Come on.
Bye, Winston.
Bye, Elvin.
GINA: No, no, don't talk to him.
It's 4:20. Don't you have to be somewhere?
Oh, no.
The shakes.
Six... Where are you, number six?
NAPOLI: Hey, Bishop, I thought you left early.
Assumed you weren't coming back.
There was something wrong with the shakes, so I went in and just threw them out because there's something wrong with 'em.
Speaking of which, I should probably go ahead and throw that one out. What did you do to the shakes?
They've been compromised.
What... did... you... do?
Look, I really, really want this job, Mr. Napoli, and I know you're going to f*re me if I tell you what I did, but I would love a future here, and I don't want that to be jeopardized by a moment of... poor judgment.
I put my beans in your shakes.
Yeah, and I...
I shook it around a little bit like this.
In there? You stuck 'em down in there, huh?
I did.
(laughing)
(laughing)
Oh, man!
(laughing)
(laughs weakly)
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna do that to Kareem.
(chuckles)
Hi.
Hi.
I have something to say to you.
You don't have to apologize.
Well, I'm not here to apologize.
I'm here to fight with you, and I don't care if you want to fight or not.
All right, let's fight.
Well, I was prepared to have a perfectly nice weekend with you, and you just give up, and you come home.
Because I was bleeding from my hand. I had to go to the ER.
I had to get a stitch.
Ooh, stitches.
I'm too fancy for a Band-Aid.
I'm actually... I'm actually really sorry about that.
Jess, I haven't played a drinking game in ten years.
The only reason I did is
'cause you asked me to.
If I want to have a drink, I don't really have to play a game while I'm doing it.
Well, that's my world. Garbage disposals don't work.
Elevators don't pass inspection.
Wait. I didn't know about the elevator.
Yeah, it was, like, the cables were really thin. We signed a waiver.
They took 100 bucks off our rent.
That's really not safe!
Well, that's where I live, and those are my friends.
And that wasn't even the first s*ab this month.
And Russell, my life is just as important as your life.
And if you want to get with me, you're gonna have to get with my friends, and that is a Spice Girls song.
(chuckling)
(laughing)
We just had a fight.
I won.
You did not win.
Hey, tell you what. Let's just go back to your loft and try again.
Let's just hang out.
Oh. Now?
I mean... I just got here.
Maybe later.
(laughs)
Okay, that sounds like a plan.
Those boxers you borrowed ... I'm gonna need them back.
They're my lucky underpants.
Lucky underpants?
And what are the values of the Olympic games?
Openness, exchange.
The first victims of an authoritarian security regime.
I'm Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and that's The View from Up Here.
Are you ready to run?
I have my playlist all ready.
Actually, it's Diane Keaton's autobiography, and she just filmed First Wives Club, and it's getting me pumped!
I totally forgot we were going to run today.
I e-mailed you, like, three times.
Maybe you typed
"gmoil" again.
No more excuses ... we have to train.
We signed up for this charity run and now we have to do it.
Why can't we just donate the money?
Why do we have to run the six miles first?
That's a good point, but, no, you're gonna go...
Oh, no, Jess, look, I can't go.
I am super hungover right now.
Plus, Masha had a bit of a crisis.
She accidentally ate a cookie.
What?
Because she fell on it.
I am devastated.
She is devastated.
Well, why don't you come running with us?
No, she definitely can't.
You can run off that cookie.
It's great.
You know what? We will do it tomorrow, I promise.
It's more money for charity.
It'll be so fun.
I mean, that was a close one.
Good thing I'm a quiet breather.
I learned that as a kid playing "Who passed out?"
with my mom.
My mom always won.
Jew in the couch, Jew in the couch.
Nadia, American manners.
Sorry.
Jew-Jew person in couch.
She's not wrong.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪
Okay, bye, Nick.
So you'll call me?
Um, yeah, yeah, I'll definitely...
Are you, are you okay?
I'm gonna call you.
Um, okay.
Do you hike? Do you hike?
Okay, I...
This was fun.
Okay, I'll call you tonight to make sure you're okay?
Please.
That was ridiculous.
I can't do this, Winston.
I don't know how to sleep with 21-year-old girls, and for the last couple weeks, that's all I've been doing.
What's going on with you? Are you okay?
I saw something a few days ago.
Now, I've been sworn to secrecy, but it is just too big.
You know I can't keep a secret, I can't lie, Winston. You saw me with that girl. - Don't leave me like this.
Even thinking about keeping a secret turns my back into a Slip 'n Slide.
Come on, man, you got to help me out, okay? I'm dying.
I don't want to know.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on...
I'm dying! I'm dying, man!
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know!
Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!
Ew.
It's happening under our roof.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes!
This makes me hate things.
I know, man. It's like up is down.
Up is the new down, man.
Now my back is sweating.
All right, who knows?
Everybody but Jess.
Hey.
Hey, Jess.
We're just hanging out in the hallway.
What's going on? Nothing's going on.
Yeah, actually, I'm really annoyed.
Cece bailed on me again. We were supposed to train for that race this weekend.
That is so Cece.
I know... I mean, and the weird thing is that she said she was hungover, but last night she said she didn't want to go out.
Maybe she had a guy over.
Not like that ... I didn't say anything.
If you think about what I said, I didn't say anything.
You have a secret.
You have a secret.
No, you have a secret.
Turn around.
You turn around.
Let me see your back.
Please don't.
J- ust be cool about...
Ew, gross.
J'accuse, Miller,
j'accuse.
You fold like a lawn chair.
Fold, fold.
Yes, you ... fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.
Winston told me Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!
Come on, man!
What?!
Oh, my God.
They know, Schmidt.
Sweatback?
You told Sweatback? Come on, Winston.
Jess.
God.
I am so sorry that you had to hear about this like this.
But, I mean, can we just take a moment to celebrate me?
Schmidtty really did it this time.
I mean, I'm having Indian every night.
No, no!
Whoa, whoa!
Jess, I'm really sorry you found out this way, okay, but trust me, it wasn't some big conspiracy.
It was just something that happened and then it got out of control, sort of like poison oak and I just couldn't stop scratching it.
Cece started it.
That's...
I did, I started it.
Why, Cece? Are you trying to get back at your parents?
When did it start?
Jess, I want to emphasize that we are not dating.
I can't stress that enough.
This is just sex.
Mm-hmm, when did it start?
1:03 a.m., February 15, right on schedule.
Two months ago.
Two months?
Two moons have passed since you started doing it?
Why do you start talking like a Native American when you get angry?
Two moons have passed!
Just a quick sidebar.
Uh, we've done it in every room of the apartment.
Ugh, even my room?
Just the one time.
Oh, God.
How long have you known?
A few days.
You didn't tell me either?
Jess, just as a reminder, I told you seconds after I found out.
Because you're weak, Nick, weak.
Okay, I agree. Just chill out. Stop yelling.
Jess, I want to tell you everything.
What do you want to know?
I don't know, Cece. How would I know if you're telling the truth?
Come on, Jess.
Are you seriously mad?
No, no, I'm not.
I'm really glad you two are having fun.
How cool is that?
For what it's worth I think what I did was really brave.
Oh.
Get off of me.
Yeah.
Hey, have you guys seen a scarf?
Holly said she left it out here.
It's my favorite scarf because it's a circle, so you never have to think about which end goes on the right or the left.
My therapist gave it to me.
She's Asian, but she's the nicest.
Who is that?
Nobody, just...
Who was that?
Was it that stuck-up bitch from last night with the fake hand?
Whoa.
No, it was no one.
It was just... it was just beep-beep-beep.
Was...
I'm so old.
I don't even know how to use a cell phone.
Come on. Let's go clubbing.
You want to go clubbing?
Show me the phone.
Let's go back to when we were having fun.
Let me see the phone.
No, just chill out.
Let me see your phone.
No!
Smooth.
I'll call you.
Nick, are you kid...?
What, you keep the ringer on?
Amateur move, man.
Yeah, I'm just in over my head.
Schmidt, I hate asking you this, but how do you do this?
Oh, glory be, are you asking for my help?
Oh, I-I'm flattered.
Pull up, pull up, Nick. Yank back on that yoke.
We have to face the reality of the situation.
Schmidt has been having consensual sex with Cece and lying about it.
He's better than us at this, Winston, and I hate it as much as you do, and, Schmidt, I hate saying this, but I might...
I might respect you.
Thank you for saying that.
You've come a long way, man.
Since my 20s, I've had a string of lesser paramours which, like weathered stone steps, have led me to the Hindu temple, a.k.a. Cece, because she's Indian.
You don't have to be so gentle with me.
All right, oh, that's how I like it, baby.
All right.
Sex, man. It's the real stuff.
I don't know that I should help you.
You're not a player.
You're a clingy serial monogamist with ... well, with a terrible metabolism.
Schmidt, I need you...to teach me to be a douchebag.
Let's get to work.
What's happening in the world?
Hey, babe.
Oh, hey, Cece.
Doing some stretches?
Good guess, model.
No, just limbering up in case I want to have sex with one of your roommates.
Do you want some company?
What?
Do you want some company?
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
Diane Keaton is talking about her rich life full of loyal friends.
Oh, Jess, I hate when we fight.
I get so stressed out.
I mean, my eye twitches back.
I'm eating bread, all right?
Just let me come on this run with you.
No!
Seriously, Jess, it was just one secret.
Everybody has got secrets.
Good afternoon.
Uh, my name is Mr. Schmidt. M-R...
Not even a real chalkboard.
First of all, Nick, congrats.
Thank you.
You're meeting a lot of young women, and for whatever reason, they seem to, you know, find you appealing.
In the restaurant of life, you have selected the tasting menu.
Okay, I changed my mind. I don't want to do this any more.
Nick, you're terrible at lying, so what we want to do is, we want to focus on S.S.V.
I cannot believe you slept with Cece.
Short, simple...
vag*na.
Vague. It's actually... it's actually vague.
Let's apply it. I'm one of these young girls that's coming in here.
I want to party. I'm in college. Let's do this. - I'm in.
Hey, what happened to your phone?
Jesus took it.
A Jesus hawk on a speedboat.
The environment.
Bears, family, magic.
Mm-hmm.
I need your help, Schmidt.
Yeah.
I'm the girl, and the whole objective is to get me out of the front door as fast as you possibly can.
Let's do this.
Ready?
Yeah.
What's your name?
My name is Janine, all right?
God.
Don't make that sound.
Good morning, Nick.
You really gave it to me good last night.
You gave me the full business, yeah.
This is really weird, Schmidt.
It's one of the weirder things we've done, right?
What you thinking, brown eyes? Want to grab some brunch?
Sure, Janine, that sounds fun.
God ... no, you don't want to grab brunch.
Okay.
Come on, damn it, Nick.
I'm all turned around.
Focus.
I just had sex with Janine.
I have feelings for her.
Yeah, so you're done.
Oh, I just sleep with her and then kick her out like she's a piece of meat?
This is the problem.
All right, ask me again, Schmidt.
Okay, cowboy, want to saddle up and go again?
No, sweetie, I can't.
Good ... why can't you?
I got things to do. I got plans. - You have work.
Plans can be canceled.
I don't want to live in a house of lies.
I can't do it any more.
Is this happening, too?
No, this is not happening.
No, this is not happening.
This isn't what it looks like.
Okay, look, fine, from now on, we are going to be open and honest in this loft, and that means that I have some secrets I want to get off my chest.
I'd rather not hear those.
Nobody wants to hear these.
Schmidt, a couple months ago I found Nick using your chenille throw as a napkin.
That is a microfiber blend from Pakistan, you heathen.
Stop quoting the catalog like a weirdo.
Each heirloom-quality...
Good, this is healthy. Air it out.
All right, one more.
Schmidt said that Winston is in danger of becoming a nanny for life.
He said you were going "full Poppins."
Okay, Winston, I can see anger in your eyes.
Schmidt said he thinks about you sometimes when he's making love to himself.
What?
One time.
What?!
I thought about bangs and your face just appeared beneath them.
Okay, by the way, like I'm the only one.
Nick told me it happened to him, like, like, a bunch of times.
Winston, you told me the first week you got back from Latvia, you had a sex dream about Jess, and she had raccoon hands.
Dreams do not count.
You've all thought about me while self-completing?
Yeah. Yeah.
Look, Jess, it's not that big a deal.
Really, it's, it's the sincerest form of flattery.
We're going back to keeping secrets.
When I walk through this door and into my room, this conversation never happened.
Oh, my God!
So, what did the raccoon hands look like?
Oh, man, they were digging through the garbage.
Oh, my God!
Do not drink my almond milk when you spent the whole night drinking Schmidt.
Why are you dressed like a Mexican wrestler?
Because Cece, I don't want to live in a world with secrets.
And that means that I now know my three roommates have all thought about me while self-completing.
So, I'm gonna wear my winter clothes until I can deal with that fact.
But it's better than not knowing.
Is it really better?
Yeah, it is.
Jess, I don't want to fight with you any more, okay?
I said I was sorry.
We tell each other everything. We always have.
I've never not told you something.
That's what second base means?
Then I'm not a virgin any more.
Is it weird that he wants me to talk in a deep voice and call myself Kevin?
I had a dream that I k*lled you.
You tell me everything, all right?
I stopped telling you everything because every time I did, you got so judgmental and critical.
What?!
I had to give it a try, Jess.
I mean, that was the same hand that was inside Elmo.
Cece.
Okay, yeah, you got me.
You don't have secrets, Jess, because you never do anything stupid.
Look at me!
With guys.
So, living with Spencer for six years was not a mistake?
Cece, I'm not judging you.
It's just... Schmidt?
Judging. See what that is?
No. I'm not judging until now.
Don't look at me!
Oh, Jess, would you please!
A winter hat is not gonna make us stop thinking about you from time to time when we delight ourselves.
Oh, no!
Hey, could you guys keep it down? I have a lady visitor.
Hi, Nick.
Oh, I get it.
It's actually kind of a fantasy of mine.
Can you say the following words out loud?
"The ice roads are too dangerous!
You're gonna have to turn back, Chief."
I'm not saying that.
Okay.
I want my scarf.
It is 62 degrees out, and I am freezing.
No. I had work. I-I have plans. I...
Get in there! Come on!
Can I just pay you for the scarf?
Fine. $25.
25...! No, I'll just help you look for it.
Nick, where'd you go?
Are you kidding me? No, no, no. It's a bear.
There's a magic bear in there! That's all it is is a magic bear. Just stop. Just...
Hey, Nick.
Who is this?
Can I have this circle scarf?
It's my scarf.
No.
It's my scarf!
It's mine!
It's mine! It's mine!
Nick, I just want you to know that I am not judging you right now.
Oh, yeah. Right, sure.
Ladies, let's not do this.
At least not with our shirts on.
Do you know how many things I haven't told you?
Nol I don't, because, apparently, I don't know you at all.
Are you running a 10K tomorrow?
Who knows? Are you even against MS any more?
Beats me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
They've stopped hitting each other, and they're just hitting me!
All right, you want to go? This New Year's, I wasn't at my parents' house.
I was down in St. Barths with a guy who might be an arms dealer.
And my feet aren't whiter than yours.
I just told you that to make you feel better.
And when we were ten years old, I went to the movie My Girl
with Jessica P before I saw it with you!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
And... I own a motorcycle.
Jessica P?!
Jessica freaking P?
Oh, my God, are you crying under there now?! - No! No!
I think you are.
No, I am not.
All right, everybody stop!
Wherever you are right now, just sit down!
Okay, now, Saturday is a day for sleeping, and damn it, you will not take that away from me!
You ... give her her scarf back.
Finders keepers is not a thing.
You ... get out of my house!
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I? Well, I am Theodore K. Mullins.
And Nick is my lover on the down low.
Tell her, Nick. Tell her how it really goes down in apartment 4D.
Oh, great n*gro spiritual, please come down and loose these chains on this woman!
Flesh on flesh.
When the lights are off, we are all the same.
Not true.
Dear lord, help me, Father!
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Yeah. I'm out.
I'm leaving.
Hey, can you give me a ride?
Get out.
I'm gonna stop and get a manicure.
Do you want to...?
Okay. Yeah.
You told Harpo to b*at me?
Bye, guys.
You want them over me?
Over me?! You...
You're sweating so much, it looks like rain, and you...
You, you're peaking, man.
You're at the prime of your life. That's actually...
Cece, get rid of the motorcycle! And Jess, don't act like you haven't thought about us, too, when you're going solo.
Okay? I don't work a
9:00-to-5:00. I'm here all day.
I can hear you!
Now, go away, because I'm... having cereal.

Why do all female runners look like old German women when they run?
Oh, boy, look at her glisten!
Oh, Cece.
That sports bra is doing God's work right now.
Two months. - I can't stop. I got to b*at Jess.
What are you...? What is wrong with you, sir?
That is Cece's water!
You animal!
This thing with our girls has gotten out of control.
Our girls?
Yeah, it makes me really sad to see them fighting over me like this.
Then why are you smiling?
Have you guys... seen... Cece?
Yeah, she's way down there.
Hasn't even broken a sweat.
Jess, okay. Jess, arms up.
Arms up. I need you long and loose like sea grass.
Moving. Move...
Oh, my God, why?!
I'm sorry.
I'm just mad at you.
My adrenaline is going.
Did you make that?
What?
And Cece let you wear it?
What? She thought it was funny.
Cece! Cece?
Cece!
What's that about, man?
I mean, I think the shirt's pretty funny, no?
Not funny at all.
Puns are creepy, and they freak me out, and you know that. - I like it.
Nick!
Oh, no, no, no.
I hooked up with both those girls last week.
I didn't know they knew each other. I thought they just lived in the same apartment.
Why didn't you call me? - Why didn't you tell me you hooked up with my roommate?
I don't...
Willow, I didn't call you because I had a family emergency.
Is everything okay?
Yes, it is.
And Megan, I didn't tell you about Willow because the moment we had was so beautiful and intense, that for a second I thought we were the only people on the planet.
Oh. Okay.
Well, we'll see you later.
Bye.
Bye, guys.
It worked.
Where did that come from?
I don't know. I'm trembling, but it worked.
That was so good my pants just got tight, Nick.
Oh, God, now I hate me as much as I've always hated you. - Skin.
See, I have to do this now.
No, you don't. Don't do it.
Yes, I do. - Skin. All you have to do is just not do it.
I have to. No, because it works.
Cece?
Cece, I can't... breathe.
Cece, I know why you didn't tell me about Schmidt ... because you like him!
What?!
The shirt, Cece.
You thought the shirt he made was funny.
You obviously like him.
It's the only explanation for thinking that's funny.
Oh, my God, I think you're right.
And you didn't want to tell me
'cause you knew that I would know.
And you weren't ready to admit it to yourself.
Okay, can we just say that I didn't tell you because I'm a total bitch?
'Cause I'm way more comfortable with that.
Oh, maybe I like Schmidt.
You... You can't tell anyone.
Yeah. That's like a secret only I know.
Heads up.
I'm-I'm peeing.
Oh, my God.
Okay, come on. We got to finish.
Oh! No!
Oh, come on, man. Come on, dude!
Hey, here they come. Here they come.
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Come on, ladies! Be strong!
Come on! Come on, ladies!
Come on, guys.
All right, let's go!
Come on... Come on...
Finish strong!
Good job, guys.
Winner! Oh, man.
Thanks for waiting, man.
Hey, thanks for the ten bucks.
Guess what, you guys.
My shoes are filled with blood!
Oh, God.
I think it's time to go home. A little help. Come on.
All right, Cece, I got her, I got her.
All right. Okay, Jess, here we go.
Okay, Schmidt, grab her feet.
All right, there we go.
Lead us away.
Good job, Jess.
Real proud of you.
What are you doing to that basil, Cece?
You trying to make it confess?
Easy with the Kn*fe, Robespierre.
I will cut off your weaker fingers, Schmidt, and I'm gonna start with your pinky.
You guys are adorable.
We are not adorable.
Okay? We are just two people having casual, successful sex.
My bad.
Please.
All right. I can't stand this heat.
I gonna get out of the kitchen.
Ow. Ow.
You should really stretch, Jess.
Ow.
You know, Jess thinking that we're a cute couple is...
I don't... It's kind of a turnoff.
How do we explain to her that this is just... it's just sex?
Mm-hmm.
What is that?
That is shoddy workmanship is what that is.
I'm taking you off prep.
Go clean the garbanzo beans.
I'm taking my Kn*fe.
Be careful with that Kn*fe.
It's from Japan.
Why? Why, Cece?
Why am I sleeping with Schmidt?
Is it a pity thing?
Is he sick?
Are you working for the government?
Damn it, he's holding you against your will, isn't he?
If he is holding you against your will, blink twice.
Blink twice.
Are you tired of being turned on?
Hmm? You have a mole fetish?
Is it huge?
I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.
Is it huge?
Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom Tony the Tiger style.
Naked with a kerchief?
What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No, what do you call top, no pants?
Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington. - Honey the Smacks Frog.
There's a Donald the Duck.
I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi
'cause that's naked with a tie.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
I saw his entire butt.
Look, Dirk's a good guy.
He was my roommate when I was in law school.
Smartest guy I know.
So, he's a lawyer?
No, he's not a lawyer, but he does have a law degree, a business degree, and a master's in agriculture.
He's kind of like a degree collector.
He's got his PhD in poetry, so...
That sucks for poems.
How'd it go with Fancyman?
It was an amazing first date, except for one awkward part at the end.
I don't go on dates very often.
Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.
Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.
Unless they dig for it.
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.
Oh, hi.
Black sedan?
Uh, yeah.
What?
So, he patted me on the back.
I thought I'd at least get a front pat. Whoo-ha!
What?
Look, he probably just got nervous.
No, Russell's never nervous.
That's the worst answer.
Winston, what do you think?
Oh, thank God.
Hey, what's up, baby?
Ooh.
Hey, is that Shelby?
What was that? That was a cat sound.
Oh, because you did the whip, we should've...
Guys! - It should have been the other way around.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.
But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.
You got it.
That sounds good.
No, that was a joke; I love it when you guys ask me stuff. It makes me feel really important.
And I love it...
"One shade the more,"
"One ray the less,"
"Had half impaired the nameless grace."
Are you wearing a ladies' scarf?
Come to my lecture tomorrow night.
Absolutely not.
She's missing out, my man.
Hey, Schmidt?
Yeah?
Mind if I borrow your car to take Shelby to the airport?
Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,
"man-bulance"?
The man-bulance is resting. He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.
That's cool. I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle all of Shelby's luggage anyway.
Ooh... What the hell is wrong with you, Winston?
The man-bulance could fit the luggage of nine Shelbys.
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.
You know what? Here you go, Winston.
There you go.
Enjoy luxury.
All good, man.
I got your second set, so thank you.
How'd you get my second set of keys?
Hey, someone left your door open.
Someone left your face beautiful.
Who is that?
Apparently, his name is Dirk.
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.
But should that stop you from seeing this?
Yeah!
That's awesome. Does he keep you happy?
He does what he's told.
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?
Oh, you're a sex-cretary?
I am definitely the boss.
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess ♪
I hate bachelorette parties.
I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
This plane goes down, there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.
Sharks? I thought you were going to Vegas?
No, I'm going to Mexico. I thought I told you that.
Hmm-mm.
Well, if you don't want me to go, I don't have to go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.
It'll be good, you know?
We spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
Did I say something wrong?
What?
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in the company's name into a version of "We Didn't Start the f*re."
Totally fine.
What do you need, like, 20 minutes?
Cece, this... Okay, this is real work for my real boss who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So, first of all, thank you for the demotion.
And second of all, I quit.
So, I'll see you tonight.
Did you not hear anything I just said?
Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-don't-don't involve them.
Oh, my...
They just didn't hear.
Don't bring them into this.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Hi.
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar, I love... I love you both.
All the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
Was it like a caress or like a... like a pat?
No, like a pat;
It was distinctly a pat, and it was actually kind of hot.
The man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
Maybe.
Once or twice.
No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.
Well, what do I do?
I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.
You just call him.
I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls, and I quote,
"not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."
Big deal. Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power unless she's sexting, in which case, she gains a half power.
Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...
I mean, what does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with ... boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man, and I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You've just got to pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
You know what? You're right:
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
What is that?
It's a phone.
Oh, God.
And thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan, from Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
Watch him bring it home, man.
Do I have to?
We have to rage.
"Rage against the dying of the light.
"And when the light is no longer bright."
"Don't think twice, it's all right."
It's over.
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
Professor?
Yeah?
We wanted to remind you about the post-lecture wine and cheese event.
A soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that.
That was me. - Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...
I don't read it.
Bye.
Oh, Mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
You guys having problems or something?
No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard to support me."
"Financially."
It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
Scarves?
Undergraduate ladies.
You see, girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them, sire their children.
They want you to have a-a bedframe.
Right, yeah.
Hmm? They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?
Have you hung out with a
20-year-old dude lately?
Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low. - Right.
They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet. - Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.
Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.
Sounds good, man.
What, dude, relax, okay?
I just said we're gonna give each other space, doesn't mean I can't call her, right, to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what "space"
means, right?
That's space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico, and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give my any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?
Now, Nick, I want you to give me some space.
You got it.
All this space allows me opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
Smartest guy I know.
See how much sex we could be having?
That-that does...
Get out of my way, bookworms!
You ready to make love to some college chicks?
Hey, when's the last time you had mono?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
What... are you wearing?
I don't... I don't know.
I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.
I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
I've never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even fantasy location...
number three?
Okay.
Um, how good are the Beatles?
Beatles are the best.
Were you so upset when they broke up?
I would have been, but I was one.
Well, you're not one any more.
How's your prostate?
Uh...
I had my breast exam last week, and, like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there, but we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
Oh.
What?
Hey, I...
Is everything okay? Oh.
I got to go.
This ought to take care of the dinner. - Yeah.
Okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...
Here, there's cab fare.
Get home safe.
Oh.
Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?
I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
No flights tonight.
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston. You're so great."
Thank you!
Nope.
Hey, my name's Nicholas.
Nick, Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Dirk, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "Shorty"
still cool?
We just got to find your angle with these college girls.
Your hook, your panty-melter.
Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
Hey.
Don't-don't do this.
Skyler, Miriam, come over here for a second.
Don't humiliate me, Dirk.
How cool is my friend, Nick?
Are you a professor, too?
No, no, no, I'm a bartender.
30 years old, I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
Are you a cop?
Sometimes.
Do you have identification on you?
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
Jess, you made it to the party!
What's going on? Why is the cast of the Social Network
in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius!
20-year-old girls ... they think I'm awesome!
And look at 'em!
They don't know what
Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman? Where is he?
I don't know. It was horrible.
He left and gave me
$100 for a cab!
You know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90
to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
Hey...!
I'm gonna die alone!
Oh, no!
I am so, so sad right now.
My heart hurts!
You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?
'Cause he is so smart.
So smart.
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
This.
I'm not happy! 30 sucks!
Ah, weird party move.

Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in my urine for the rest of the car ride than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?
Yep, absolutely. Don't even have to think about it.
I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions, like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"
And, "Seriously, why?"
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
A secre-tarty.
Shut... up.
This is pretty great.
I'm freezing.
Yeah.
I'm so cold.

Babe, I don't want space.
Neither do I!
That's why I'm at your apartment.
I got on a plane. I wanted to see you.
What?!
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico. I came to see you.
Are you serious?
I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care. Shelby.
You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you, too.
I'm coming back, baby. No space!
Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir, just me and my American heart...

Then how do you explain...
this?
I can't... sir.
No one in the entire world can explain that.

I want a donut.
Then let's get you a donut.
Please?
I want to talk to you... alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Hmm. Can you drop me off at my dorm?
It's called Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now.
God!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was bad-ass!
Hey, uh, kiddo.
Okay.
Nick, that's the road.
What's up?
You want the woods.
I want the woods. You're smart, Russ.
Come here.
Hey, it was nothing.
You're okay, Russ.
Okay, we can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.

So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to
Wicked while you're alone, I could use that information against you at any point in time.
By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...
Is that a stop sign?
Well, you'd probably want to slow down...
Oh, my God. Maybe it's a go sign.
I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!
It's just what I'm thinking.
And I want to talk to you.
I want to have a chance to explain.
That's okay. I understand.
I just... I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls
'cause we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because...
I think you're a hotty with a body.
Oh. Um...
I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989...
when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
Oh.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this weekend, I didn't pack her inhaler.
She was having an asthma att*ck.
Is Sarah okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks. I-I...
I just feel like I should have explained.
And I really wanted to kiss you the other night.
Really?
I wanted to do more
than kiss you.
I'd like to do you, at some point.
Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.
Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
I was nervous.
You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
Oh, my God, it's happening!
It's coming! I think I'm dying!
I feel scared and excited!
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
Do you think now is the right moment?
I think so.
Okay.
Get out of me, you poison!
Wait. Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
Oh, my God!
You're welcome.
Get out of here, Dirk!
You get out of here...
Come here.
Hey!
Oh, no!
Where are you guys?
Hello?
Hey, where are you guys?
Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
I'm so cold.
Who is this?
Oh, my God, Dirk is d*ad!
Dirk is d*ad!
Greatest guy I knew.
Buying a phone's a big deal.
I mean think of how long you'll have this thing.
It's like buying a car or a bra.
Eight years, man. Ow.
Hey, uh, sorry, I was just checking your credit score, and I got this number that's crazily low, so I'll try again.
Don't bother. I'm sure it's right.
Seriously?
Are you kidding me?
250?! You get 150
just for being alive.
Hey, Mojan!
Got a 250 credit score!
Well, I guess the $40 I saved on that Gap card didn't pay off.
Do you have, like, a box of charity phones you're sending to Africa?
Can he just have one of those?
Claire, Brendan, this guy's got a 250 credit score.
We're bringing everybody out?
Look at this.
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been doing this a long time.
I've just never seen a score this low.
Did you just wake up from a coma?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪
But you've always wanted a thing.
This could be your thing, like, the guy with no phone.
Well, who is that guy?
I don't want to be that guy.
No, no, no, it's like mysterious.
It's like,
"I want to call Nick Miller."
"You can't;
He doesn't have a phone."
"What?!"
You can go all Ghost Protocol on everyone.
See, that's cool.
I mean, I always wanted to be a mole person.
Schmidt, you're the Michael Jordan of bar trivia.
We were in the Greek mythology zone.
I mean, you knew every question.
Perseus, Icarus, Medusa...
Medeuce, deuce!
Guys, you're shouting.
I mean, you knew every answer.
Like, what was the tiebreaker you got?
Calvin Coolidge's birthplace?
Little Plymouth Notch, son.
Wow, I'm done with this. Hey, Shelby...
I mean, seriously, how did you know that?
How do you forget that?
You don't.
Jar!
I'm gonna jar myself on that one.
He's like a trivia god.
Girl, get up.
Winston, don't worry about it, man.
It's your public school education.
You'll catch up.
Jar again.
Excuse me?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hi, hi, I'm Russell Schiller, Sarah's dad.
Oh, yes.
We spoke on the phone.
I'm Jessica Day.
Did you just curtsy?
I did, yes; I did.
Is this a bad time?
Nope, no, no, no, I was just cleaning up from the sexual health class.
I had to take condoms off 30 cucumbers, and condoms are harder to take off than I thought.
I know how to put them on, but I didn't know how to take them off.
I guess someone else has always done it for me.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got off a flight from London.
Maybe I'm a little out of it.
Oh, London.
Did you have a busy sch...
Se-dule?
Did you have fun?
No, I was advising a merger.
Oh, fair enough.
Um, you wanted to talk to me about Sarah's art.
So, this is one of the pieces she did.
Um...
That one's called, um,
"At the Mall with Grandma."
She made that in dream-cess, which is where, um, I let the kids have time to create something.
Sarah's gonna be opting out of dream-cess from now on.
She'll use that same time to review her other schoolwork with a tutor.
Oh, did you talk to Sarah about this?
Well, I don't need to.
I want her to know fractions before she goes to high school.
Well, I follow the curriculum.
My daughter is wearing doll's heads around her neck, so whatever you're doing, keep it up.
Okay, I talk to your daughter every single day.
Do you? Because hiring a tutor is not the same thing as spending time with her.
I'm her father, not her friend.
I know what she needs.
Give my best to Mrs. Monogamy.
Cheerio.
He's the third largest donor in the city.
We take his money and then what, we have to answer to him?
So, you're asking me to give up my integrity?
That's what I'm telling you to do.
Yes, we need his money.
So, he pulls his donation.
You know what? I'll raise the money myself.
I'll get a ragtag group of kids together.
A lost soul, an orphan, a Jewish kid with a keyboard, a little slut who can dance, and one fatso, and I'll choreograph some dances, make a show.
You did that already, Jess.
It's called the spring musical, and it literally brought in $60.
Please don't make me apologize.
You're gonna go to his office.
You're gonna say that you were wrong.
Say you're never gonna let the kids do anything creative ever again.
From now on, your classroom is full-on North Korea:
Math! Math! Math!
Make sure he doesn't pull the donation.
When he was yelling at you, did do that little thing with his mouth?
You know, that little smile thing?
You know, like, like where he goes, "Mmm"?
That's really weird, Tanya.
Apologize.
Why did you make me look stupid in front of Shelby last nigh? - Wait, what?
Which of the five great lakes is located entirely in the United States?
Lake Erie?
Yeah, if Lake Michigan didn't exist and we won a fictional U.S.-Canada w*r.
Lake Michigan.
Correct!
Oh, you want me to take a dive next time?
Take a dive?
You know, like pretend like you know more than me when Shelby's around, so it seems like you're smarter.
I know you'd do the same thing for me if I were the dumber one.
Wow, okay, so let me get this straight:
You think because you know a few facts about Princess Kate, that makes you smarter than me?
First of all, Kate is a duchess and whip-smart by all accounts.
And second of all, don't be so prideful.
Look, man, there's nothing wrong with being the second smartest in the loft.
You know what, let me take that back.
Jess is a teacher of children.
You memorize facts.
I can memorize facts.
That doesn't make you smart.
Okay, well, maybe, but I'm definitely smarter than you.
Whew! Glutes are done, my man.
I'm gonna go to the stairwell, work on my calves. Come with?
Hell, no.
You sure?
I have to grovel.
I hate groveling.
I would have lasted two seconds in the court of the Sun King.
I think about that all the time.
You do?
Do you know how much I grovel on a daily basis?
It is literally obscene.
Come the weekend, I'm the one who's filling up my cart with Fila, Nautica, Impulse Fila, Hilfiger, CK, BR Leather cuff, and more Fila.
This is the problem, Jess.
It's rich people.
We are right where they want us, Jess:
Just suckling on the teat of consumerism.
Yeah. - That's the exact reason I got rid of my phone.
You were denied a cell phone because you have the credit score of a homeless ghost.
How I got here doesn't matter.
You weigh more than your credit score.
I'm here now, and I'm loving it.
Yeah.
I'm the guy with no phone.
I mean, right now, I'm writing a letter to my friend, Kev, seeing if he wants to party with me this Friday.
"What up, Kev?
"You in?
Nick Miller."
Yeah, Nick, he might pull the funding from the school, so I'm just a little bit...
Blame your period.
I've actually done this before.
I mean, both parties knew that I was lying, obviously, but it didn't matter because they knew that I had utterly humiliated myself, and at the end of the day, they respected that.
I'm sorry; I just feel like someone should suggest a simple apology.
I know that's not where we're headed here, but I'm just gonna go on record and say, I think you should apologize like a human.
No!
No! I'm going with Nick
'cause I don't think I have to apologize.
Yeah, Jess, so march into his office, and say, "Hey, Mr. Fancyman, you can't tell me what to do.
"Your money doesn't own me."
And then throw away your phone.
Yeah, I'm gonna throw my phone into the fiery chasm where he keeps his poor people.
Actually, scratch that.
My mom's got your number in case of emergency.
I want her to think that I can bring something to the table.
I care about this girl, Elvin.
I want her to be my girlfriend.
She sees me, all she sees is a part-time nanny, and that's...
You are a part-time nanny.
I want her to think I'm smart.
What about fake glasses?
It worked for me.
Okay, okay, I'm on my way to his office, and I have a speech I wrote for Fancyman, and I want to practice it.
Why are you listening to Nick?
It is a horrible idea.
Ghost Protocol, man.
You're using my phone.
It's not Ghost Protocol.
It's you using my phone.
This is a group call; I'm just talking in my living room, and it happens to go into that box.
Okay, I'm gonna start with a quote against social Darwinism, then a discussion of the Gilded Age, the robber barons, the Great Society, how we ended up with a huge wealth disparity in this country, and then, I end with a bluegrass version of Public Enemy's
"Fight the Power."
Bad finish.
What is that?
Are you driving a lawn mower?
No, I just...
It's my car.
Look, this is a great opportunity.
You need to ask yourself, where are you even going?
Buy a new car.
You don't need a car.
Oh, my car's stalled out.
Can you guys come and help me push it?
Yeah, we'll be down in a few minutes.
Hey, can I help you?
What? Oh, hi.
Um, Uh, Mr. Schiller, um, how'd you know I was here?
I was driving by and I saw you.
My office is right here.
Oh, oh, what a coincidence.
I had no idea.
Weird.
What's wrong with the car?
Guy sounds like matinee idol.
Shut up, Schmidt.
I'm just pushing it to the nearest gas station.
It's like, a mile away, so I'm fine.
I know a guy;
He'll be here in ten.
Oh, no, Mr. Schiller.
Russell.
Mr. Schiller, I can take care of myself.
It's how I was raised;
I wasn't raised with money, so when something broke, we pretended it still worked.
Some of my best memories are pushing this car around on family vacations.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, tow truck's on the way.
Look, that's very nice and generous of you, but I really... I-I mean, I need my car, and...
Here, let me help you.
Take mine.
What?
Take mine.
Here.
No.
Come on. Take mine.
Uh, I don't know how to drive cars that work.
You can drop it off tomorrow night.
I'm having a party, a cookout.
Come on over any time. Come on.
Thank you so much.
This is amazing.
I will return it washed and polished.
Do you think it's a superhero?
No.
I think it's Jess and some weird guy.
Miss Day?
Jess ... you can call me Jess.
Great, I'll see you tomorrow, Jess.
Go is the one on the right.
The one on the left is stop.
Thanks.
What kind of car is it?
We are the 99%.
Is it an SL?
We the 99%.
Does it have a push ignition?
Does it have a push ignition?
Please tell me it's not a hybrid.
And then he gives me his car, just hands me the keys.
It's like so...
Rich people! They're always giving you their cars.
It's like, let them eat cars.
You know what he's doing?
He's taking back the power, so I have to go to his cookout, and instead of standing up to him, I have to grovel.
Just a thought:
What if he likes you? No, I hate him.
This guy is single and he's sweet.
Sweet? No.
He's not sweet.
I would never go for that guy.
Why?
Because he's the type of guy who has a linen closet and a towel warmer.
You know me.
I'm only attracted to guys who are afraid of success and think someone famous stole their idea.
I like an underdog.
Spencer didn't even own sheets.
Yeah. He slept on a pile of washcloths.
Can I say something to you now that you're not gonna like?
Yeah. - Maybe Russell intimidates you.
Because you wouldn't have to take care of him, because he would take care of you, and that just terrifies you.
Uh, no.
Spencer... wore... jellies.
How many pounds in a metric ton?
2,204.6. Next.
In 1948, Albert became the first...
American...American monkey in space.
Let's go.
This ancient...
Mesopotamia. h*t me.
You don't actually know what a Mesopotamia is.
Of course I know what Mesopotamia is. Don't be crazy.
Use it in a sentence.
Look, there's Mesopotamia.
So I'm going to have to draw on your hatred of rich people for this, okay?
Hate me up.
Well, for starters, look at this place.
I know. Ugh.
I'm betting at one point there was a moat.
Rich boy punk.
This hallway's excessive. It's braggy.
Well, I guess everyone's out back.
Ugh, look at this place, Jess. Are you kidding me?
It's so over-the-top.
A kitchen island? Be a man!
Let your counter attach to itself.
I know.
It's like, I can't chop vegetables over here.
I need to do it over here. Love me, love me.
I mean, we're making an egg, not going to outer space, guys, right?
Right. Nice burn.
Whoa.
Makes me want to sit by the f*re, and talk about how annoying Gandhi is.
Whoa, something's happening to me, Jess.
I want to sit at that desk and veto a law.
What are you doing, Nick?
That's someone else's stuff.
Jess, when I put my hand on this desk, I feel sexually proficient for the first time in my life.
Nick, this man stands for everything you hate.
I'm President Miller! You're all fired!
Bring our boys home.
Okay, this is how evil geniuses are born.
You smell that? It smells like leather and Teddy Roosevelt and wistfulness.
I want to wear this cap.
You're not helping me!
Nick, I know this room is beautiful, gentlemanly, and... smells like Christmas, but you have to stay strong.
I'm gonna go find Russell.
Keep... playing with that duck.
I want to k*ll you.
Because I respect you.
I think I understand hunting!
Hello, Russell.
Hey, Jess. Thanks for coming.
Oh, the mechanic called. Your car's done.
He also wanted me to communicate to you that you need to change your oil.
I want to, first of all, say thank you, Russell.
Um, and second of all, I want to say, um, I know you donate a lot of money to this school, but...
You think I'm a snob.
No. No.
No, I have nothing against people who...
live in enormous mansions.
Jess, I'm 42.
I've made a lot of money, and I enjoy spending it.
Oh, you've got to try one of these. - Oh.
Deconstructed spring roll.
It's delicious.
Oh.
Try it.
Oh.
Oh, my God!
This is so amazing I want to punch you!
Russell! Russell.
Come tell Carolyn about that time you delivered that baby.
Oh. Yeah.
You delivered a baby? Just... it was twins, actually.
Twins?
Are you wearing my sweater?
No. Yes. It was on the back of the chair.
So I thought the sweater belonged to the chair.
I thought it was a chair sweater.
Those exist.
I'm Nick.
Oh, you know Jess.
Yes.
I'm Jess' roommate. I'm the guy with no phone, if she's told you. That's my thing.
No phones.
Why don't you have a phone?
Because I don't want to be tied to some corporate system.
That, and no one would give me one.
I have incredibly low credit ratings.
Yeah.
When I was your age, I had a really skinny ponytail, and I think I was living off of selling my own blood.
That's funny. Then what happened?
One day you just woke up and you had all this?
Well, I realized I wanted to grow up.
That's what happened.
Um... I got this as a gift from the company for Christmas, so...
Oh, wow, that's great.
My boss gave me three credit cards he found at the bar, and said, "You didn't get these from me."
It's a bartender joke. I'm a bartender. We...
We don't steal credit cards. Cool, cool.
Here. Take it. No, no, I can't take your phone, man.
I can't... it's just... it feels really good in my hand.
Is it possible to be sexually attracted to an object?
Yes, it is. It really is.
You can keep the sweater.
Thanks, I... I don't know why I put it on, to be honest with you.
I just came in here, and it smelled like Shakespeare, if Shakespeare were a damn cowboy.
And hawk's nests, and boat fuel, and cigars and burping... man stuff!
Yeah, yeah, enjoy it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I appreciate you.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Hey, Russell, why are you being so nice to me?
Well, you're Jess's friend, right?
Now, you fold that sweater.
Don't hang it.
You listening to me? Fold it.
Ah, I don't care. Do whatever you want.
That was really funny, man!
Why did I...?
Bidet!
Bidet if I do.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh. Shut up.
Jess, is that you?
Oh, God! Oh, God.
What's wrong?
Sorry, Jess. I'm coming in.
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
Oh, my God! I just...
Wait, wait, wait.
Ow! - No, I just pressed some buttons with cartoon characters on them.
Yeah, it's Japanese.
Of course it's a Japanese bidet.
Of course you have a Japanese bidet.
Look, Russell, I want to tell you that I am not sorry about what I said because Sara is 12, and she is creative, and I don't care if you pull your donation, I am not gonna grovel...
Why did you think I was going to pull the donation? I would never do that.
Okay.
Oh, jeez.
It is some really deep cleaning here.
Oh, God.
No, Jess, Jess!
Wait!
Oh!
Jess, you put it up to six happy faces.
I've never gone past three.
Jess, why are we leaving?
And why are you all wet?
Okay, did you take a bath in his tub because you wanted to see what it'd feel like to be him?
'Cause, weirdly, I get that.
No. I want to leave because we don't fit in here, Nick.
I know that I've been saying you can't give into this guy, but I don't think that you should run from him, either.
'Cause no matter where you go, he could find you.
I believe that.
No, running's good. I'm gonna run.
Hey, Jess, stop.
Look, this may complicate things, but I'm in love with him.
Shut up! No, I won't shut up.
He smells like strong coffee and going to see a man about a horse.
You're ridiculous, Nick. Let's go.
I am ridiculous, okay, but no.
Be a grown-up.
He likes you, Jess.
Go back in there.
I think it'd be good for you.
And I'm not just saying that because I'm in love with him.
Just do it.
Don't be intimidated just because you're just younger, poorer and wetter than everybody in there.
Goldfinger! I mean, no, no.
I meant to say Golden-Golden Hind!
Golden Hind is what I meant to say.
No...
Winston, you are all over the place.
The Green Bay Packers did not invent the T formation, nor was Crispin Glover the first man to die in the Revolutionary w*r.
Shh.
This is supposed to be fun.
Look, Babe, it is fun.
I just don't want to look stupid in front of everybody.
All right?
You're not stupid.
Well, I mean, he did skip Earth when listing the planets.
What has gotten into you today?
I just... I just didn't want you to think I was an idiot.
You tried to memorize all the trivia answers? Winston!
I don't want some smart, rich guy who owns his own car.
I want to be with you.
I don't care if you don't know Ernest Hemingway's birthplace.
Oak Park, Illinois.
So, what are you saying?
Are we doing this? Is this real?
Like, are you my girlfriend?
Because if that's what you're saying, then that would make me very happy.
Mm, me, too.
Shelby, be careful with his mustache, please.
Mmm.
It's very delicate.
I can't watch this anymore.
Winston, I hope you're better in bed because your street work is embarrassing.
Am I talking too much? I don't want to ruin the moment.
You know what? If this was my grandmother's building, she'd be outside on the patio, and she'd be yelling down at you, and she'd be saying,
"You look beautiful.
"The two of you are a beautiful couple.
I'm glad you found one another."
But she wouldn't invite you up because she's a horrible r*cist.
You want me to put on some Jodeci?
There you are. I was looking for you.
Okay...
Listen.
Uh-huh.
I'm not used to people who have it all together.
I think... you scare me.
Oh, no, no, I don't...
I don't have it all together.
I don't even know how to talk to my own kid.
I can't even remember the last time she hugged me and used both arms.
She said she wanted to go bra shopping, and so I bought her a ski vest.
Look, every eye roll means you're doing something right.
Really?
No, that's just what I tell parents to make them feel better.
Jess, will you have dinner with me?
Yes.
Great. Good.
Sh-Should I, um, text you, or...?
No. I'll call.
Great.
Okay, cool.
All right, cool.
Oh, no... Hey, Jess.
Jess, why are you in the koi pond?!
Jess, are you okay?
Oh, God, oh, God.
Okay, come here.
Oh, God!
Koi in my dress!
Let me help you.
Koi in my dress!
Are you all right?
Oh, you got a fish in your dress.
I didn't ask you! I'm talking to you!
You want to come in here and charge me a billion dollars?
That's nothing to me!
Want it? Want it?
You're off the streets.
I don't want to, either.
You're the best cop I got!
As President Miller of Earth, I'd like to speak to the Galactic Emperor, please.
Yeah, it's about money.
I'm gonna push a piece of paper across the desk that I've written a little number on.
Why don't I just tell you? It's five kabillion dollars.
So, what do you say?
Is China mine, Mr. Ying?
SCHMIDT: Here? You're dropping me off here?
R-Right in front of this obvious pickpocket?
Look at the size of that guy.
He's clearly new homeless.
We're a mile away from the loft, Cece.
I'm not getting caught with you.
I'm gonna have to run all the way home.
And I have my slippiest loafers on.
If I were you, I would get walking right now.
You're never gonna get home before dawn.
Okay, look, I'm fine with you not telling anybody about us, but you cannot just call me at anytime and just summon me for intercourse.
I have no control here, and I'm stressed out all day long.
It's like you're ripping the side block out of my mental Jenga.
I'm totally falling apart.
Okay, Schmidt, you...
you really need to learn to take a breath and calm down, all right?
We're just being a little spontaneous.
Words that have never been used to describe Schmidt:
"spontaneous, flexible, easy-going."
I'm like a Marine.
You're nothing like a Marine.
I'm totally like a Marine, all right? You know what? Fine...
I'm... I'm out of here.
Take these, and take care of them ... I can get a tetanus sh*t, but I can't cure damaged suede.
JESS:
Can you believe
I found this on the street?
Who would want to throw this away?
A blind man who suddenly recovered his sight?
Get rid of it, Jess ... pine has no place in this loft.
It's the wood of poor people and outhouses.
I pay rent, so I think that gives me the right to add a few things. - Jess...
(chuckles)
you're wrong.
Okay?
My answer's no.
Well, my answer is yes.
I'm keeping the hutch.
I had a bad night.
I'm really, I'm just asking you, please d-don't push me.
'Cause then I'll have to reinstate my ban on high-waisted shorts.
You would not dare.
Try me.
That was the worst four weeks of my life.

Hey, Winston, why are you still drinking?
It is 10:00 in the morning, man.
Yeah, I know what it'll feel like when I stop, so I'm just gonna stay a little drunk, forever.
Well, why is there no girl version of you, my man? (groans)
Moving on.
So, last night's poker game.
Got pretty intense.
I don't even know what you're talking about ...
I was so hammered last night.
I've never been more sober in my whole life.
I'll remember this as long as I live.
I'm all in. Uno, bitches.
Read 'em and weep.
Straight flush.
Aw!
So, what do I owe you, 20 bucks?
20 bucks?
Yeah.
You owe me $487.
Come on, Winston!
Aah! Schmidt makes me so mad!
I want to put one thing, one thing in the living room, and he won't let me.
I'm not putting up with this.
Oh, yes, you are.
We live in a fragile ecosystem.
It's a delicate balance.
It's a broken ecosystem, dominated by an apex predator.
Chill out, Jess.
We let him run the house, no big deal.
The boy cooks and cleans ... and happily, I might add.
Yeah, he probably couldn't sleep last night
'cause he was so excited to clean up after us.
I know he's been bad lately, but...
Schmidt's an odd bird.
He can't handle it when things aren't clean and orderly.
It's been that way since the day he moved in.
Welcome to your new home, Schmidt.
Come on, play ball.
(whooping, laughing)
Coming home!
(gagging)
Well, I'm fed up with it.
And he's got to learn how to relax.
And, Nick, why do you have...
cannons drawn all over your back?
Those aren't cannons, Jess.
Long-stem mushrooms?
Nope.
Oh, so that's...
not a mossy cave.
Mm-mm.
Mmm, no.
Probably not.
(door opens)
What the...?
What is happening...?
I can't take this right now.
What, do we live in a pawnshop?
Hey, Schmidt.
(chuckles): Hey, Jess. What, uh...
Where did all this come from?
I found the afghan underneath a Dumpster outside an animal shelter.
And I found the lamp underneath the afghan.
I'm gonna assume that these are your spices jammed in here with my spices.
Yep.
I would really appreciate it if your non-Tahitian vanilla was not touching my Tahitian vanilla.
Oh, Schmidt, they're more than touching.
(breathy voice): What's it like living in the most populous isle in French Polynesia?
(French accent): I could tell you, or... I could show you.
(breathy voice): Not in front of the cloves.
Where's my burr coffee grinder?
Oh, you know, I think it's in the hutch.
You put it in the hutch?
The... aah, this thing was on the street.
It's a coffee grinder, Schmidt.
I think it'll be okay.
A top-of-the-line conical burr coffee grinder.
You know what that means? It means it doesn't smash up the beans like some pedestrian blade grinder.
It actually grinds them, for a deeper, richer, more satisfying flavor profile!
Oh. Well, I've used it repeatedly to make homemade crayons.
Does that show up in your flavor profile, Schmidt?
Uh, yeah, that's fine.
If you're looking for your oven mitts, they're in the top drawer of the hutch.
(chuckles):
Oh. Okay, fair enough.
Hutch is gone.
No.
No, no, no.
No. - No hutch.
No, no!
Stop! Don't move the hutch.
Bye-bye, hutch!
This thing makes me emotionally nauseous!
This is my hutch. Don't move it!
All right, you're right, you're right...
I'm so sorry. You're right.
It's a beautiful piece.
It looks great there.
My apologies.
Thank you.
Oops.
Schmidt, you have a real problem.
You've got to learn to calm down.
Yeah, yeah.
I love the beach.
Now, isn't this better than arguing about a hutch?
Yeah, if you like hanging out on the rim of a giant fish toilet.
Jess, I can't believe you brought me down here.
This is a great place to talk about your problems.
Jess, this sucks ... I just want to go home.
Schmidt, come here.
Look. You got the birds in the sky.
Sea and sand.
The wind in our hair.
(grunts)
You've lost your kite!
Have fun flying your string all day!
Sorry I forgot my wallet.
Thank you for paying;
It's delicious.
Yeah, which is weird, because I clearly remember saying,
"Hey, man, don't forget your wallet."
And then I still forgot it.
You still forget it. Wow, it's weird.
Yeah, you said that. We're getting older.
Yeah, I said that.
Okay, this is a good segue.
(sighs):
Um...
can I talk to you about something that's kind of tough?
(sighs)
Yeah, man, sh**t.
"The subject of this talk is the debt of money between us.
I feel that..."
Oh, man!
I thought this was about something serious.
You set that up like it was about something different.
This is about the poker?
Oh, I'll pay you your money. Relax.
"If I am reading this section, then I can only assume
"you have told me to relax.
You wrote that?
"Let me assure you I am very relaxed,
"although I have good reason not to be,
"as you owe me a very large sum."
I will pay you the money, you clown.
"I am aware that we're both broke,
"one of us embarrassingly so. Points to Nick.
"I have recently tumbled down the socioeconomic ladder
"and have h*t rock bottom,
"where you, Nick Miller, Thank you.
"Have been waiting patiently for the past 15 years.
"But I want that money.
"Give me my money. I really mean it.
"It's my money. You owe me that money,
"so give me my money. Seriously.
Are you finished?
"Where is the money, dude?
You wrote "dude"?
"But I am not without pity.
I am willing to just call it an even $200."
Everything let go with just $200?
Right.
All right, I can do $200.
$200? Two hundo clean?
Yep.
All right.
I did pay for gas here, though.
So that's, let's say, ten bucks.
So we're at $190.
We'll say clean $190.
I hate to be this guy...
but I got the fights on Friday, so that's $30. So let's call it $160
and be done with it.
$20 for beer that night, so $160 takes us to $140.
Just to be fair.
And I didn't write a stupid letter about it.
But let's say right now $140.
You ate a lot of the nachos!
Littering!
$15 for littering!
♪ What a way to live... ♪
How fun is this!
It's not my cup of tea.
♪ Don't you know that life ♪
♪ Don't wait for death? ♪
♪ Choo-choo ♪
(whistle bl*ws)
(screams)
No!
No! No, Jess, no!
I can't believe I never noticed this before, but, Schmidt, you are legitimately crazy.
I think we're all a little bit crazy, don't you think, Jess?
No, I mean, you're like aging-
ballerina, child-chess-prodigy, professional-magician crazy.
It's my mom's fault ... you know, I come from a Jewish family, but she used to tell me the reason Santa didn't come to our house was because my room was dirty.
The only thing I ever controlled was what I ate.
That's why I got fat.
Yeah, I got fat 'cause I used to eat Concord grape jelly from the jar using a candy bar as a fork.
It's because you didn't have any structure.
You know what I mean? That's what happens when you don't have any rules.
None of these people have rules. Especially that guy.
He's wearing ladies'
bikini bottoms.
SCHMIDT: Jess, I'm not like these people, okay?
I don't have dreadlocks. I don't own a snake.
And I don't understand how these people think that they're relaxed, because they're not ... they just have nothing to do.
That's not me. It's not that easy for me.
Sounds to me like a lot of excuses, Schmidt.
Just be spontaneous.
(rhythmic percussion playing)
Hey, Nick.
Look, man, I'm sorry to bother you while you're clearly sitting here working hard making lots of money.
All right. - But if you'd kindly just pause that for one second, I have a few accounts that I'd like to settle.
Account number one:
A $15 receipt for a Chinatown box turtle.
Bam. Here we go.
We're doing this, huh?
Yeah, we are doing this. - Great Item number two:
Cancelled $35 check for registration of a domain name ...
"It's Nick Miller Time.com."
"Hey, guys, Winston, I got a good idea, man.
I'm gonna be a big-time blogger."
I have to go to work...
Uh-huh.
...At a bar, where
you drink for free.
Wow.
How much does four hundred cognac and colas add up to, Winston?
You want to go there?
Yeah.
Okay. How about all the times I sat around listening to you bitch and moan about how Caroline broke your precious little heart?
Okay, in eighth grade...
Eighth grade.
...You "accidentally" saw my mom naked. - Mm-hmm.
Before she stopped exercising and let herself get chubby.
(laughs)
Okay?
So how much is that, in terms of money?
'Cause I haven't gotten over that.
And I would say four to $5,000.
Hey, guys. Hey, guys.
Schmidt, Winston saw my mother naked in eighth grade; in terms of mon ...
I waded into the ocean without my aqua socks.
JESS:
Mm, he did.
He let go.
(drumming, chanting)
He washed his hands in a public restroom.
And there was a man in there.
And he was using the toilet, full sit, no door.
And I didn't break eye contact.
Not once.
That's not letting go, that's cruising.
Hey, Schmidt.
There's a spill.
I know.
Do your exercise. You know.
Yeah, okay, the exercise.
(clears throat)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I feel great.
I'm gonna go take a shower with Nick's bar soap, like a common ranch hand.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - What is going on?
You messed with the ecosystem.
And you guys said it couldn't be done.
You have no idea what you're getting into.
You're welcome.
JESS: Schmidt, you're k*lling
with me with that drumming!
(rhythmic drumming, Jess moans)
JESS: You're k*lling me!
Look at this mess. How did this happen?
So, this is your fault.
No. No.
This is good for Schmidt.
'Cause you guys have been taking advantage of him for years.
You make him cook, you make him clean...
Where's my money, dude?
Frankly, it's... sexist.
Oh, my God. Ew!
How's it sexist?
Who's cleaning up?
I cleaned this morning.
All right, fine.
I'll clean, you guys go to the store.
Act like an adult.
BOTH: I'm not going to the store with him.
Where's my money, dude...?
Stop throwing things at each other.
JESS: Oh, come on. WINSTON: Where is the money?
You're a child.
...My car, too, while you...
SCHMIDT:
Silence, friends!
I made you necklaces.
Hey, do you want to go to the store?
Please, God, yes.
$100? How did Schmidt buy all these groceries with 100 bucks?
It's only $100?
$100.
You should've told... we have way too much stuff, man.
Yeah, like shrimp cocktail.
We don't need a baked ham.
All right.
Winston?
Sorry about that.
Really? Really?
Two cake mixes?
Really? All these soups?
Pizza? Frozen pizza?
You fat ass. What are you trying to do, die? Shut up, dude.
We have enough ketchup. We have enough ketchup! Come on, really?
Next, please.
Oh, hey, how you doing, sir?
We only have $100, Gary, so could you stop checking us out when we h*t $100?
Yeah, you got to include tax, too, so, like, $93, just... Cool?
Yeah, just that'll do.
Okay, guys.
Thanks. - I'm gonna put my stuff at the front,
'cause you obviously don't know how to shop. - You're being ridiculous.
Are you getting me?
We have enough ketchup.
(chuckling)
Epsom salt?
Yeah, okay. - What, are you too good for regular salt?
You know damn well I got to soak my trick foot.
Oh, Winnie, your little trick foot.
Yeah, my trick foot, and don't ever call me Winnie.
Aw, Winnie...
Fine.
You don't owe me anything.
The slate is clean. We're good, we're even.
Oh, good, that's how I feel, too.
Because in my mind, your mom will always be the winner of Best Boobs.
Really, Best Boobs?
Yeah. Master's Division.
You're gonna talk about my mother?
You're gonna talk about my mom's boobs?
Is that... you gonna go there?
Don't push me in a supermarket, man.
You started this.
Did you just slap me in the face?
No, I did not.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not afraid of you, man.
Don't act your...
(grunting)
NICK:
Grow up, dude!
(singing to himself)
Hey, Schmidt.
Oh, hello, Jess.
Hey.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, just checking up on you.
Oh, I see you're eating street meat wrapped in street meat.
This is my man, Gordon.
You've outdone yourself once again, Gordon.
Excellent.
Did you go to work today?
No, no. No work.
I haven't been there in a while.
How long is a while?
I don't know. Three days?
Schmidt, I made a mistake in bringing you down here.
I shouldn't have done that.
Please come home.
Why?
So I can cook and clean?
So I can show you where the vacuum is?
WOMAN: All right.
(drumming starts)
Okay, fine, I don't know where the vacuum is.
That is one reason why I came here, but I really want you to come home.
Everything's falling apart without you.
Nick and Winston are fighting all the time.
And all of us lost our keys to the mailbox.
Schmidt, just listen to me, because you don't belong here, like, really.
Do you remember when you got yourself off to An Inconvenient Truth?
How about when you dress up like Shia Labeouf from
Wall Street Two for Halloween?
Do you remember when you said jazz music was America's greatest mistake?
Say it in drums, Jessica Day.
Me hablo drums.
Hey, man.
I got the last frozen thing.
I was gonna ice my wrist, but...
How about this?
Take half, pal.
So kind of you.
(chuckling)
That hurts, man.
(sighs)
I am so hungry.
Remember those things that Schmidt used to make us with the peanut butter and the raisins on the celery?
What were those called?
Ants on a log.
Ants on a log.
I just got why they're called ants on a log.
Looks like ants on a log.
(door closes)
I'm hungry, man.
Hey, Schmidt, is that you, buddy?
No, it's me.
What the hell happened to you?
I went down to the beach, and I tried to talk to Schmidt, but he just ignored me, and he went back to twirling his f*re baton.
He's really bad;
He b*rned a lot of people.
I feel like they should let you twirl it around a few times before they actually light it on f*re.
Well, look, Jess, being friends with Schmidt is really complicated.
'Cause you want to change him so badly, but you can't
'cause he'll just get worse.
You guys were right, I upset the ecosystem.
(sniffles)
This is not what I wanted.
I just wanted to put my hutch here.
Make the place my own, be a part of the family.
What family? With these clowns?
Yeah, you clowns.
Well, look, you want in, you're in.
Congratulations, welcome to the family, Jess.
Aww.
Yeah, we don't "aww"
in this family.
(door unlocking)
(mumbling)
Hey, guys.
Hey, Schmidt.
Um, we need to talk.
Something not cool?
Schmidt, we miss you.
You just want me to clean.
No, that's not true.
Well, it's a little bit true.
There's truth to that.
Okay, look. I want you to clean.
Look, we're so proud of you for letting go, and relaxing.
But this isn't like you.
You can run away from your problems, but you're just gonna find new ones that pop up like hepatitis.
And Nick and Winston want to say to you that they really miss you.
You're freaking me out, man.
Why are you wearing that crystal around your neck?
Nick, the crystal symbolizes energy.
All a crystal is is rock poo, Schmidt.
Look, I need you, Schmidt.
Okay, I need you to tell me what pants not to wear and to exercise more often.
I need you to make fun of me when I call a panini a hot sandwich;
How am I ever gonna learn?
WINSTON:
I even miss your hair chutney.
Without you, man, we're just three idiots who live together.
(sighs)
You make us a family.
(chuckling) Well, I'm the cool rebel brother.
You're the mom. - The mother. - Mom.
NICK: Look, Schmidt, if you come back to us, I'll let you clean my room.
The white whale?
Think about how many dust bunnies are under my bed.
How many stray socks.
JESS:
Hey, Schmidt, I got you something.
Is that a boutique box?
A pair of gray, shiny, twill, flat-front trousers designed by a man named Calvin.
Never been tried on.
Pockets are sewn shut.
Don't you just want to get your thumbs in there and rip?
Okay, so, I'm just gonna leave this on your bongo drum, and you can, you know, give them a whirl if you feel like it.
Just make the right decision.
(whispering)
Come home.
Take the pants.
(clears throat)
(sighs)
Oh, come here.
(sighs)
(chuckling)
Calvin.
You magnificent wizard.
(water running, dishes clattering)
Scmidtty.
Nick, your hair is doing that thing that I just... I just hate.
And Jess, can you please ask Winston to help you move the furniture out? He could use the exercise.
You're looking a little, you know... (sputters)
He's back.
And Nick, Winston, we have a urinal.
How are you still missing?
(door closes)
CECE: Schmidt?
Schmidt, wake up.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey!
(both screaming)
What...
are you doing here?
What do you think I'm doing here? Come on!
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
What?
Cece, before we continue, I clearly have no control in this relationship, and... I'm fine with it.
Good.
But know this, you're the one who broke into this apartment at 3:00 a.m.
for a little bit of this Schmidt, so who's really in control?
Shut up!
(sighing)
Wait, oh, are you sleeping in dress pants?
What? They're slacks.
What's the big deal? Calm down. - Oh...
SCHMIDT: Look how excited Hector J. is to see you.
CECE: Yeah, I've already met Hector J., so...
Ooh, look, he's knighting you.
Oh, no, please stop knighting me.
Don't...
Lady Cecelia...
No, Schmidt, I'm gonna leave.
You have entered the order of the round table.
I'm getting my bag, okay, I'm gonna get my...
Oh, I want to stay.
Dame Nasty Cece.
Nick, go out ten yards, cut left.
Winston, go long, post right.
Jess, go down, out towards the parking lot.
Get in the car. We'll meet you back at the loft.
Oh, very funny. You're a comedian, Schmidt.
Hike!
Schmidt! Come on!
(groaning)
Oh! WINSTON: Did you see that?
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm oka ... (groaning)
What is going on?
JESS: Nick... Nick, I'm so sorry.
(groans) Oh, my God!
This is real!
Probably your lateral sizer.
Shut up!
Can you just...
Okay, let's go. (screams)
Rotator cuff? JESS: Can I...?
What do you need?
Nothing from you.
Please go far from me right now.
I can taste my spine.
Three or four down there ... vertebrae.
Why is no one helping me?
Not you! Not you!
♪ Hey, girl ♪
♪ What you doing? ♪
♪ Hey, girl ♪
♪ Where you going? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪

(groaning)
Are you sure you're okay?
You're walking like a Disney witch.
Let me drive you to your doctor.
I don't have a doctor.
I don't have insurance.
Nick, you need to see a doctor, if only to make sure that your junk is clean.
I don't go to doctors. JESS: I'll take you to my friend Sadie.
She'll just look at you ... she won't charge you.
Okay, I don't go to doctors!
Are you sure you're okay driving?
Yes, I'm fine. I've never been better.
I'm great.
Thank you.
(engine starting)
I feel better already.
See you guys back at the loft.
(crashing)
Oh, my God!
Oh!
What did you just...?! NICK: I'm okay.
I'm okay. Don't worry. WINSTON: Oh! What did you do?
(groaning)
You h*t my car!
I'm okay.
(Winston groans)
Oh, Winston, relax.
Okay? Relax.
That's all I did. I did this.
The rest was already there.
Actually, I think I undid a dent there.
I'm taking you to see my friend. Get in my car.
No... Jess, no. Oh!
Now!
So she's fitting us in between patients.
(Nick groans)
Jess?
Is Sadie a gynecologist?
No, she's an OB/GYN.
(groans)
I'm going to go.
It's a different thing.
I'm going to get out of here, actually, I think.
Yeah? I don't think you are.
(groaning)
Nick, she's a wizard with a speculum.
Nick!
I don't have a vag*na.
You can take mine.
(chuckles)
(laughs)
I heard that, sister.
True dat.
(Nick groaning)
Okay, you know what, Nick?
I'm sorry that my only doctor friend is a gynecologist, but you're broke, so you're going to have to shut your mouth, and you're going to tag the things that you want in this Lucky magazine.
We're gonna have to put this baby to bed. - No.
No, no, no, Sherman, look, uh, I don't think you understand, man.
This car's been with me through everything, so... if you could just fix it.
This is not really officially a car anymore.
You didn't even buy the thing ... it was given to you as an illegal recruitment gift from a college you didn't even go to.
Things happened in this car.
Like what?
Desert Storm?
Oh, things happened.
Is this your car?
Yeah.
Cool.
Any time.
It's time for you to buy a new car, man.
You buy a new car!
I bought a new car.
It's what you borrow every morning when this one makes the weird sound.
(imitates squealing, moaning engine)
That's not a good sound.
Just give me the keys.
You shouldn't call them keys.
It's a paperclip that you start the car with.
(engine squealing and moaning)
SCHMIDT: See, that was the noise
I was talking you about.
WINSTON:
Shut up.
You know you don't have to sit like that.
It's the only way that it feels okay, Jess.
Jess!
JESS: Sadie.
Hey. Hey. How are you?
SADIE: Good. How are you? Hey, good to see you again, Nick.
(straining):
Hey. Hi.
We were playing football, and I tackled him.
Oh. Well, that's not exactly how I saw it.
Oh, I'm surprised you got hurt. You're such a big boy.
Jess tackled a girl I was dating once.
Oh, yeah.
She tried to steal my overalls.
Okay, so... does that hurt?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes!
All right.
Does that hurt?
(groaning loudly)
All right. He can flip over.
Okay.
(sighs)
So... listen.
This is not an official examination, and I am not officially telling you that you bruised your spine, and I am not officially giving you these pills to manage the pain.
Okay.
So...
please don't take those pills.
Take the pills.
Don't take those pills.
JESS: Take the pills.
SADIE: Nobody prescribed them.
Take them. Take them.
Why would you take them?
No. That's bad.
That's a code. Take them.
JESS:
That means do it.
Don't do that. No...
Those are designed for severe menstrual cramps, so they should cure your baby back ache.
JESS (chuckling):
"Baby backache."
Wait. Stop.
Hey, take another sip of water.
Yeah, um... JESS: What? What's wrong?
No, it's your thyroid. I noticed something while you were swallowing. Do you mind if I...?
I mean, I don't know what choice I have.
JESS: Do it, Nick!
Okay, Jess. Stop.
Yeah, he has a growth.
Oh, my God.
A growth.
Oh, no.
Everything works. I can swallow.
Oh, my God.
Everything's fine. I know what you're talking about.
You knew about this?
Yes.
So you've had it checked out?
No, no, I don't...
I don't have that stuff checked out. I'm fine.
I can set up an ultrasound tomorrow morning, first thing ... I've got a friend.
I can't really afford an ultrasound, but...
You're going to have to, so...
Yeah.
SADIE: All right. So I'll set that up?
Absolutely.
Right. Right.
Make sure he goes, Jess.
Don't look at me like that, Jess.
It's probably nothing.
Yeah, it's nothing.
Oh, God.
Put the baby's head at the bottom.
I'm not going to go tomorrow.
I'd rather not, because I don't want to get an ultrasound.
I just don't have time.
No, I've got some writing I got to do.
The truth is, with working out, I've got some people to see, so I just can't make it.
I lost a stamp.
It sounds worse than it is, but it's a somewhat expensive stamp and I had planned on looking for it.
One of the reasons I moved to Los Angeles was to get closer to whales, so I can record them.
I haven't gotten around to it because where we live is actually east.
It's way farther from the ocean than I expected.
I appreciate your concern.
It is really sweet. It's nice.
But this machine's still kicking, you know?
You're going.
And I know your scared, but you know what my mom used to do when I got scared?
A Daffy Duck impression.
Please don't do what you're about to do.
(imitating Daffy's lisp):
Hey, Nicholas.
I'm sorry you have a lump in your throat.
That's despicable!
Sorry. Too much?
Okay.
I got to go to work.
I'll come with you.
Oh, absolutely not.
I'll just sit by the bar.
No way.
(lively conversation, laughter)
You told them, Jess? Really, it's not a big deal.
Don't tell them.
We're just hanging out.
With my best friend.
Come on, Schmidt. What are you do...?
(sputters)
You just Fredo-kiss me? What's your problem?
Go sit down.
You're going to b*at this, man.
I don't have anything.
What is going on with you guys?
Thanks for telling them.
I take those, too ...
when I got a heavy flow.
Good to know.
Hey.
Hey.
So I heard.
Of course you did.
Can I get a vodka soda?
(chuckles)
Thank you. You being normal...
Vodka soda.
Okay.
It's because he refuses to wear a Bluetooth. You know that.
I gave him one for his birthday, too, but he just laughed in my face.
Gave it back to me for Hanukkah.
Well, according to this Web site, it could be a colloid nodule.
But that's most common in golden retrievers.
I thought my lifestyle choices would rub off on him.
I tried to set a good example.
Treat your body like a temple.
Treat your body like a temple.
But he treats his like a dump.
Like a dump!
Let me see this.
Oh, my God.
NICK: Hey, hey.
My friends.
Can I just say that these pills are amazing?
I feel, like, really warm in my uterus.
Oh! I feel good.
Feel real good.
What's with the long faces?
Schmidt?
Just looking at you and your beautiful soul.
Big, strong Nick.
He's a champ. SCHMIDT: I wish I could trade places with you, 'cause you know what, Nick?
I would do it in a second.
But I'm also glad that I can't.
Okay, what is going on with you three?
(crying): Oh, God. Jess?
Oh, God.
Hey, are you okay?
You're gonna freak him out. You're gonna freak him out.
You're freaking everybody out.
Why are you crying?
Schmidt, are you crying?
'Cause you're not helping.
'Cause you're making me cry with your emotion.
(Winston sobbing)
Really, Winston? You?
It's just that I love you so much, man.
Stop it. Enough.
Hey, I'm fine. Just stop it.
How do you know you're fine, Nick?
Is that... would that be where... in my neck?
Hmm.
(taps piano key)
I'm not going to lie.
Mm-hmm.
I think the pills are on top of me a little bit.
I think you're right.
It's so sad.
Yeah, it's really sad your friend's getting an ultrasound tomorrow.
It's just so hard.
Are you using your best friend's medical crisis to feel my boobs with your face?
Why isn't the whole world making love all at the same time?
How many...
ears does Daniel Boone have?
He's got a... a right ear, a left ear and a... front ear.
"Frontier."
Get it?
(both chuckling)
You don't get to speak at my funeral.
What?
For sure.
100%.
What? Why?
Because of that joke.
Yeah, but...
Jess, you don't want to talk at a funeral.
I've tried that once.
What kind of dummy fixes a washing machine using a Kn*fe?
This kind of dummy!
It did not go well.
I don't want you talking at my funeral!
Okay.
You can go to my funeral, but you can't talk.
My funeral is my time to shine.
I want the girls to think,
"I wish I brought Nick Miller to orgasm."
And I want the guys to think,
"I wish I bought him more stuff."
And I don't want Daffy Duck voices and feeling sticks.
You don't... you don't know how to be real.
I can't have you trying to cheer people up.
I know how to be real.
Question: Am I wearing a hat?
SCHMIDT:
Nick Miller.
Almost a lawyer.

(pounds keys)
What?
You want me to get real and stop being all cutesy and whatever, fine.
Let's get real.
You don't do anything.
Mm.
What did you want to do?
I mean, isn't there something you wanted to accomplish?
Hey, I've done things.
I wrote half a book about zombies.
Okay, just tell me.
If you could do anything, what would you do?
You know, I'm the guy who... I can't just jump into something if I don't know what's gonna happen.
I never have been that guy.
Like, I'm the, I'm the guy that, if I don't know what's gonna happen, I don't do something.
Ever. I don't care how bad I want to do it.
I don't do it.
Like, if everybody would go into the ocean and jumped in the water, well, I'm the guy on the beach guarding the wallets.
All right.
All right, Nick.
All right.
Get out there.
Yeah.
I'll hold your wallet.
I don't have a wallet.
All right, well, that's fine.
I have a sandwich bag with my license and money in it.
Okay, I'll hold your sandwich bag.
Get out there, go.
It's a little cold.
Just in terms of running into the water, it's a tad on the cold side.
Well, you know what, just... it's just...
(laughs)
(laughs)
(yelling)
We all taking our shoes off?
What's going on?
I'm a little drunk, and I can't be too sure, but I think you're finally about to see your best friend's penis.
(Nick yelling)
Nick ... he's gonna sh ...
he's gonna show his penis to the ocean and not me?
Nick, wait!
(laughs)
I'm alive!
I... am... alive!
(chuckling)
I'm alive!
(yelling)
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
This is stupid!
No, it's cold!
My testicles are in my abdomen!
What was I thinking?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! That is so cold!
That is so cold!
Words cannot describe how cold that is!
Nick, are you okay?
No, I'm not okay, Jess!
I'm not okay!
All right, I woke up today and I wanted to play a friendly game of touch football, then I hurt my back, and I went to your gynecologist, and now I might have cancer!
So, no, Jess!
I'm not okay!
(sighs)
SCHMIDT: I don't think this is the right time to bring this up, you guys, but...
does anyone else think Nick could stand to lose five to seven pounds?
(sighs)
You know what I'm thinking about, Ceec?
What, Schmidt?
That when you stand up, there's gonna be, like, a perfect imprint of your butt in the sand.
That is what you're thinking about right now with your best friend down the beach going through what he's going through?
I know, I know.
Then why would you say that?
I don't know why I would say that.
Why would anyone say that?
I've never gone through anything like this.
Yeah, well, I have.
What happened?
My dad d*ed when I was 12.
That's, um...
The only way to get through it is to get through it.
You know, I had a cat that d*ed...
Don't compare my dad to your cat.
It was a big cat.
I mean, human size.
(chuckles)
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Is this seat taken?
(chuckles):
Oh, please.
Here, will you help me up?
(grunts)
I know that you're right.
You're right, I have to start doing things.
I can't just...you know.
Jess...
I like you a lot.
I really do.
I'm glad you're around.
I'm not gonna remember any of this in the morning, am I?
Most certainly not.
Oh, no.
(laughs)
Yeah, it's... yeah.
(laughs)
Yeah, we should go home.
Yes.
Let's go home.
Hey. We gotta wake up.
Morning.
What?
Hey, Schmidty!
(whistles)
Wake up, wake up! Everybody, up!
I got that ultrasound thing.
We're late.
What?
Oh...
Hey, Winston.
We're late, man.
SCHMIDT:
Ah, fresh air.
Back to the fume chamber.
NICK: Couldn't even sell it for metal.
Hope you didn't get sand in my car.
SCHMIDT: Yeah, that's this car's problem: too much sand.
Oh, my God, there's soot coming in from the floor.
(clears throat)
Hi. Uh, my name is Nick Miller.
I-I have a 9:00 a.m. today.
Fill these out. I'm gonna need a copy of your health insurance.
Oh.
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be paying with cash, actually.
It's a mixture of, uh, paper money and change.
I do have a check that's postdated.
There's a 60/40 sh*t that's gonna clear.
I hope that's good.
Jess ... oh, yeah.
Do I have to do this now?
How long does it take to tell if someone has cancer?
Guys.
Hey.
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm fine. It's nothing.
Yeah.
What was it? What did they say it was?
I didn't hear anything after they said,
"You don't have cancer."
I blanked out. I think it's, like, a cyst or something.
Ugh.
Stop Fredo-kissing me, Schmidt.
All right, so what do I owe you?
Let's figure this out.
I've got, uh...
It's already taken care of.
What do you mean it's already taken care of?
Oh, we split it.
All right, well, I'll pay you guys back.
I just...
And can you please get a wallet?
I do have a wallet.
A wallet.
I have tons of wallet chains that you can borrow.

Hey, Jess?
Hmm?
What happened last night?
Nothing.
(ignition sputtering)
(chuckles softly)
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
(sputtering stops)
NICK: Let it go, bud.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just got to give it a second.
Bye.
SCHMIDT: It's cruel at this point.
The car's d*ad, bud.

Can't a man say good-bye to his car?
Oh! Oh!
L'Chaim.
To humping.
I was like a river.
Did you feel that? Did you feel me sweeping you along with the current of my body?
You were like a canoe on my body river.
Like you'd ever be seaworthy with those breasts.
Boobies.
I wish there was a word that meant complete satisfaction and complete self-loathing.
I've never seen a woman bite her own shoulder before.
That was the last time.
You said that twice last night.
You'll be back.
I'm like your black tar heroin.
You just need that sweet taste in your veins.
Schmidttle and the damage done.
Neil Young, yo.
Just get me out of here without someone seeing.
Schmidt?
Oh, did you have a sexual guest?
What?
Was it the same girl from the other night?
I don't know what you're talking about.
It is!
Oh, my God. You slept with the same girl twice in a row?
Was it a mistake? Was she wearing some kind of disguise?
Hey, Nick, Schmidt slept with the same girl twice in a row.
I owe you five dollars.
You know, I thought I heard the door open at 3:00 a.m.
Those are the sounds of true love.
Bet she had the time of her life.
What happened?
Did I miss her?
You did.
Man, I love meeting the girls you bring home.
I like to pretend like I'm your lover on the down-low, Theodore K. Mullins.
Damn, Schmidt, in our bed?
Where we shave each other?
I've always loved you, you're my boo.
Theodore K. Mullins is not my type, man.
So, you gonna three-peat this ho?
Who is this bitch? We want to meet her.
I'm not gonna parade her around like some trophy.
You know me, I'm not that kind of guy.
Oh!
Schmidt told me this was the front door?
What's wrong with her? Does she have a hunchback?
Dwarf parts?
Lovitz body?
She happens to be an incredibly beautiful woman.
She another one of your heavy gingers, Schmidt?
How big are her knuckles?
Butter body?
She has a h*tler moustache.
I'm sorry, just, like, I want to banter with you guys in the morning.
I just, like, panicked, and I made a h*tler joke.
I'm sorry.
* Hey, girl
* What you doing?
* Hey, girl
* Where you going?
* Who's that girl?
* Who's that girl? *
* Who's that girl?
* Who's that girl? *
* It's Jess.
Your science projects are looking great, you guys.
Love the potato battery, Harper.
Good job.
Thanks.
Luke, I like your tree exhibit.
Might want to think about changing the name.
Okay?
Okay.
Whoa.
You built a robotic arm.
I think we know who's gonna win.
Anyone can still win, Brianna.
Even me, Miss Day?
Yes.
Okay, lunchtime.
Can I have lunch in here?
Oh, no, Nathaniel, what's wrong?
In the cafeteria, kids have started playing this game, coin slot.
They put pennies in my butt cr*ck.
I made 46 cents.
No, no, no, you earned that.
Um, Nathaniel, I'm gonna help you out.
Julia sent me a cactus.
She's on a business trip to China, and she sent it to me out of the blue.
I'm not an idiot.
She's gonna break up with me.
Who told you that?
Did the cactus tell you that?
Is this one of those fortune-telling cactuses...
Winston, think. She's gonna break up with me.
She doesn't think I can take care of a regular plant.
Well, you can't.
Any idiot can take care of a cactus, Winston.
She thinks I'm an idiot.
Why are you watering a cactus?
Because I'm an idiot.
Julia sent him a cactus, which means she's gonna break up with him.
Hm.
I'm sorry, I thought that was a joke because otherwise that would be totally stupid and insane.
Snap out of it, son.
Jess, you don't get it.
This cactus is like a symbol of my relationship with her.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna quit on this.
I'm gonna get her back.
There it is.
Look at that.
Not bad, just fix red eye, red eye, red eye.
Send.
Hello?
Where are you?
Oh, hey, Cecilia, Did you get my junk mail?
I'm in front of your loft.
I know I said that last time was the last time, but... you want to come down?
Yeah, I want to co...
Yeah, I'll come down, that sounds good.
All right.
So, I think I changed a life today, you guys.
I pulled a Gandhi, a real Gandhi.
There's a student of mine, he's been bullied for the past few months, so after warning the kids that there would be serious repercussions if this continued, I delivered a lesson in the key of learning.
Learning minor.
* He's a plump bird who prefers the shelter of a hole *
* He has a stubby beak
* And a nervous soul
* Because being chased
* By predators takes its toll
* Let the sad sparrow fly on... *
You think singing a song about a kid is gonna stop him from getting his ass kicked?
I know 12-year-olds are vicious, vengeful creatures.
Middle-school girls literally scalp each other.
I spent most of sixth grade with a bald spot on my head.
What?
But don't tell me music can't make a difference,
'cause it can.
Those kids were videotaping me on their cell phones.
Right.
I think these kids are gonna really remember that.
Yeah, um, You know, this day.
What's the song called?
Um, "Sad Sparrow"
"
" why?
This is why.
* He's not smartest bird or the most pretty *
* He spreads disease What?
* Throughout the city Well, at least the bully's not making fun of that kid any more.
They're making fun of me.
The hawk just took a little poop on you.
I'm not proud of myself for saying this, but it's a really funny video.
* Sad sparrow fly on...
Why can't we just go upstairs for a little Schmidt and Spin?
You just said that everybody's upstairs in the living room.
Okay, fine, what about your place?
My place is not an option right now.
All the models are there.
It's 12 models in two rooms.
It's like a room full of hungry Russians.
Uh, yes, please, let's go there.
What about just a little good, old-fashioned car sex?
I can't do any of my moves in there.
I like to improvise with my body.
I'm like a sexual snowflake.
Each night with me is a unique experience, Cece.
Okay, are we gonna do this, or not?
'Cause I kind of need this to happen right now, okay?
Isn't there, like, a Starbucks bathroom around here or something we could use?
What do I look like, a Gypsy courtesan?
So, how hard are you gonna drop the hammer on the kid who did this?
I'm gonna find this kid, and I'm just gonna...
open up a dialogue.
Not gonna work.
Take it from me, I used to be a bully.
Ow!
Brown lightning!
Wow, you had a catchphrase? Yeah.
You got to h*t them where it hurts.
Thank you, Winston, but I have a different approach.
Jerk-sica?
My last name rhymes with "gay,"
and the best thing you can think of is Jerk-sica?
Reason.
Hey, Schmidt.
Oh, there is? Thank you.
He says we should look out the window.
There's a crescent moon out tonight.
Oh, dip, seriously?
Why do we care about a crescent moon?
I don't know.
I'm gonna live up there someday.
Hey, Julia, what's up, girl?
Hope you're having a great time in Beijing.
I miss you;
I can't wait to see you.
I got the cactus.
Thank you so much.
I'm taking great care of it.
Yeah, things are doing good here.
Everything's really cool, just...
taking names, kicking butt, you know, all that.
So, great, I'll see you Wednesday.
You're the best around.
Nope, that's not gonna be the one.
Hey, Julia, just calling back to say that I get it.
Message received.
I'm the cactus.
If you put me in the desert, I'll grow some needles, too.
You bet I would.
You bet I would.
FYI, I'm not high right now.
Julia!
Julia!
Call me back.
Call me back, Julia.
Julia, it's Nick.
I'm sorry, I just realized about the time difference.
So, if you get this one first, could you please just delete the other ones?
I love you.
What did I jus...?
I don't hear anyone out there.
I think I'm safe.
And I-I want you to know, that was the last time, okay?
This is over.
But we haven't even gotten to the cheese course.
A little sharp aged cheddar? Mm-hmm.
Manchego?
Maybe some buttery Gruyère?
You sure you want to miss out?
I just want to...
slowly peel the wax off your Babybels.
What are you even saying?
How about a little stinky Taleggio?
Why is this working?
I am so turned on right now.
Or maybe some cream cheese?
Want some schmear, Cece?
You know what?
Cece, you should go.
Because if you have the strength to turn all this down, do it.
Yeah, I'm good.
Hi. Who do I speak to re: getting something removed from the Internet?
Yeah, I can hold.
Want to party with Havarti?
Fine.
Give me the damn cheese.
So, Brianna, I saw the robot arm in the user profile, so I know you made that video.
So I thought we could sit and talk for a minute.
Look, Brianna, I know you're better than this.
Can we talk about you for a few minutes?
Can we talk about you instead?
I'm an open book;
Ask me anything.
How come you don't have a boyfriend?
And why did Mr. Genzlinger dump you?
And is it true that your boyfriend before that cheated on you?
Are you barren, Miss Day?
And why is your voice so deep like a man's?
It's no... it's not.
Your happiness seems like a mask.
Well, I better go.
What have I done?
Julia! Welcome home!
Hey.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm okay;
Welcome back.
Are you sure?
Did you listen to all the messages?
I did.
You did? That sucks.
You know, I really didn't mean anything.
I know.
I-I didn't.
Look, I got in my head, Julia, I thought you sent me this cactus because you were trying to tell me that I can't take care of a normal plant.
Which, when I think about it, I probably can't.
Plants freak me out.
I'm way better with babies, actually.
Hmm.
Not that I want to have, like, a baby with you, like, right now.
I can see us having babies.
Please, can we not...
I know, that's not what I mean to say.
No, come on...
I'm getting weird again. What I mean to say, - No, Nick, I need to say...
Julia, please, I overreacted.
I think we should break up.
I do. I mean, I didn't realize it when I sent it...
but then after listening to the seven...
Yeah, I know.
...Seven, Nick, Seven, yeah.
Separate voice mails about the meaning behind the cactus, I don't know, it really just clicked in for me, and I just, I don't think that we should do this any more.
I'm really sorry.
So I was right about the cactus.
Okay, what kind of crazy person destroys a child's robot?
Can you bring me, like, a bunch of Phillips head screwdrivers and, like, a Crescent wrench and, like, other tool things?
What if I'm busy?
Thank you, Winston.
I really needed that.
It's been a really hard week.
Hey, man, I'm going to the beach to watch the sun go down, 'cause I love sunsets.
Did you know that about me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, Julia dumped me, so sad face.
Hey, do you want to come with me to the beach?
'Cause I feel great, I'm ready to rock, but I really don't want to be alone.
Scissors?
How am I supposed to fix a robot arm with scissors?
Those are my good scissors.
Why do you have good scissors?
You know, the news only focuses on what goes wrong.
Never talks about what goes right.
Evolution.
That's it. Come here.
You know?
Yeah, exactly.
I'm gonna k*ll him. Can you get him out of here?
Hey, guys, you guys want to watch The Piano later?
Here?
You want to do it here?
Okay... all right. What's the scenario?
We enter separately, pretending to be strangers meeting in the bathroom.
You want me on the can, off the can?
No, I just, I just need to pop in this party for, like, 20 minutes.
When I come back, we'll have sex.
Okay, yeah, let's do it.
Oh, no. Um, I'm going in there alone.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'll cr*ck a window for you.
cr*ck a window for me?
Yeah.
What am I, your sex dog?
What... what if I have to go to the bathroom?
Why don't you just give me a chew toy.
Come on, Schmidt, stop being such a big baby.
Oh, my... Are you ashamed of me?
Yes. Absolutely.
100%. I'm 100%
ashamed of you.
What-what a revelation.
Okay, come on, Schmidt, I can't be the first woman who's ashamed to be with you.
Okay, look, I won't go into your party, if...
if you go to breakfast with me tomorrow.
In public.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, really?
Really.
I mean, I can survive breakfast.
I'll be back soon.
Hey, Wendy. How's it going?
I hope it works.
I didn't get a chance to test it.
Even broken, it's still got a sh*t at top prize.
I mean, have you seen some of this crap?
"What can old people do?"
"Does it taste better with hot sauce?"
My friends.
Guess what I just learned.
What's inside of a pumpkin.
Apparently, a lot.
I didn't know.
Whoa!
Winston, you have to get him out of here.
You see him, he's about to blow.
I'm not having him by himself right now.
There's Brianna.
Hi, Brianna.
You must be Brianna's moms.
I'm Miss Day.
Right. The singer.
You're the one who sings.
This is Brianna's project, a robotic arm.
Start it up, Brianna.
And a project bursts into flames.
Brianna, what happened?
Someone must have sabotaged it.
Bet it was Nathaniel.
Hey! Get my scissors out of your mouth!
What is wrong with you?!
He's been creating problems for our daughter.
What are you gonna do about it?
Nathaniel, come over here.
Um, actually, uh...this is my fault.
I sabotaged the science project.
You did what?
What?
And it was totally unprofessional.
And I'm sorry, but your daughter is... how do I put this?
Brianna is difficult.
Difficult? You're the one that sabotaged her project.
You daughter sucks.
Okay, she is a demon seed, she is the spawn of Satan.
And I do believe I speak for the entire human race when I say that people like her should not be building robots.
Who are you?
Brown lightning.
I want her disciplined.
No! No!
Wonderful.
Hey, no.
No.
Why can't we all just love each other, right?
What are you doing?
Want a science project?
How about this as a science project: love is a myth.
Why is this Earth so big and I am so small?
So, yay, Earth.
Be optimistic? Learn?
We're all gonna die alone, so...
My office, 9:00 a.m.
How embarrassing.
I was right about the cactus.
I assure you, I'll be watching Miss Day very closely.
Hey.
Hi.
I am so sorry, Tanya.
Don't be.
I love it!
Jess, you're a real teacher now.
What?
You're a kid hater.
You're one of us.
Come here. Welcome.
I'm-I'm not a kid hater.
That's right.
None of us are.
Hey, Brianna.
Can I speak to you?
Look, I know I'm not your favorite teacher.
You don't like my style.
That's fine.
But I'm not gonna change who I am, so you're just gonna have to deal with it and respect it.
Also, you're gonna take this paper, and you're gonna sing a duet with me.
What?!
Oh, yeah.
Everybody, settle down.
Camera phones are encouraged.
No.
One, two, three, four.
You really don't want to be seen having breakfast with me, do you?
Are we even still in L.A.?
Schmidt, you and I are not together.
We're not in a relationship.
We're just having sex.
And I love it.
And I'm not gonna be a prize that you get to show off.
Look, guys are always just showing me off, and I hate it.
Look, I... I want to tell people because I think that you are the dopest, flyest...smartest, ballsiest, bitchiest, truly terrifying woman that I have sexually enjoyed in a really long time.
Do you want to tell the waitress?
Uh, if I could have everyone's attention.
Real quick, if you could, uh...
Hey, guys, call a time-out to whatever-whatever-
whatever that thing is. Okay, great.
I am having sex with this woman right here.
You want to stand up?
No. Okay, you don't want to do it? All right, great.
I'm enjoying myself im-immensely.
Uh, it's, you know, a physical thing, but I am definitely, for real having sex with this girl right here, to completion.
Parkour!
h*t it!
Down! h*t it!
Down! h*t it!
Yeah.
Hey.
I got you a real plant.
Yeah, I don't want it, Jess;
I'll just k*ll it.
I know.
You're a plant k*ller.
And I write songs.
We're weirdos.
But that's who we are.
And that's fine.
And you have a giant cactus needle sticking out of your face.
What? Where is it?
Can you get it out? Get it out. Ow.
* So it's time we all make a change *
* Find somewhere else for our loose change *
The song is called "Let Me Lift You Up With My Robot Arm"?
Yeah.
It's catchy.
I mean, the title is flawed, there's no question about that.
But you are kicking ass with the comments.
Look at this.
"This teacher is muy caliente."
Hot, hot, hot.
"I'd like to grade her on a curve."
Yep.
"Finally, entertainment that doesn't resort to salty language."
Finally.
Jess, these commenters are all you, aren't they?
Yes. Yes, they are.
* A robot arm.
That's classic Nick Miller. Hey look, I'm holding your hand, and what?
Yeah, I want to go out tonight.
Ugh, couples!
Boo. Hiss.
Every time you have sex with the same person, Jess, you die just a little bit.
It's like a copy of a copy.
But lucky us ... we get to go out looking for some strange.
Happy V-Day, player!
Holla!
Look, Jess, truth is, I don't go out on Valentine's Day.
What?
There's no thrill.
You know, all these bars filled with emotionally vulnerable women.
I'm like a Dominican teenager playing Little League.
It's just not fair for everybody else.
It's my first single Valentine's Day in six years, and I... I need to go out, okay?
We need to go out.
'Cause I'm feeling pretty twirly.
Twirly?
Twirly.
Is that like horny?
I got the dirty twirls, Schmidtty.
Watch out, 'cause you're about to get laid... world!
* Who's that girl? * * Who's that girl? *
* Who's that girl? *
* Who's that girl? * * It's Jess. *
So, we're doing this ...
full-on Valentine's.
What'd you do last year?
I was fighting with Caroline.
What were you fighting about?
Oh, you know, the usual ...
about how I make too much money and I dress too fancy and I'm too good at communicating my feelings.
Right.
Well, this year we're gonna make up for it.
You and me are gonna do a real Valentine's Day date.
I know. God, what's the plan?
Well, first of all, you're gonna need a map of Arizona.
I can get that.
And a container that you're comfortable getting urine in.
Oh, I have one in my purse.
You do?
No. Bad idea.
You can't go on a first date on Valentine's Day, Winston.
Dude, I'm telling you, it's not a first date, man.
We used to hook up all the time.
You know, for two years I had her number stored in my phone as "Shretty,"
'cause I was too drunk to type "Shelby."
She just wanted a relaxed night in.
It actually sounds kind of sexy.
Dude, we're just trying to figure each other out, that's all.
You know where that puts you in six months?
Yeah, watching
It's Complicated on DVD while you cradle your newborn baby to sleep.
And guess what? It's not complicated.
It's about a bunch of rich white people who are remodeling their kitchen.
Are you sure you're really ready for that?
Dude, it's gonna be great.
What are you doing?
I'm packing an overnight bag in case I have one-night sex.
I've got a T-shirt, socks...
Is this a sewing kit?
Yes, it's a sewing kit.
Stain remover.
* Hello? *
You don't have one-night stands ... you get way too attached.
I mean, you could have an emotional connection with a shoe on the side of the road.
Oh, one shoe? I hate that.
Is this Schmidt's idea.
It's my idea.
I want to try a one-night stand. Tonight...
is all about what
Little Jess wants.
Little Jess.
Okay, all right. I am gonna text Kyle and tell him to meet us at the bar, because I'm not leaving you alone like this...
with all of that.
I'm sorry, I don't know who's smelling what tonight.
Excuse me, you know where
Julia Cleary's office is?
Uh, does she need to sign for something?
Little late for a package, isn't it?
Let me guess, your bike broke down.
Fixed-gear, single-speed.
I've been rocking a three-speed.
No, I'm not a bike messenger.
Follow me.
Okay.
She can get pretty cranky when she gets interrupted, but I'll tell you what, I would still h*t that.
I mean, despite the age difference, I would just take that to Pound Town.
You know what I mean?
Just take her a visit to the boneyard.
You know what I'm saying.
Hey, Nick.
That's my boyfriend, Nick.
Hi. That's my little intern, Cliff.
Excuse me, Cliff.
What...?
Could you get him a water?
Thank you.
Hey, Cliff.
Thanks, Cliff.
Sorry it's such a mess in here.
But... I went full out with the cheesy Valentine's Day stuff.
Are you ready for it?
What did you do?
Ha-ha!
Heart boxers! These are the best!
Right? - I'm putting them on right now over my pants.
You can't stop me.
I don't want to stop you, because I...
am gonna be rockin'
this action.
You were born to wear that thing.
We can never talk about any of this, to anybody. - Okay.
Can we go?
I have a little bit more work to do ... just, like, an hour.
Hey, babe.
Ooh, you brought wine.
Yeah.
Good. We're almost out.
It's not the food!
Come on in. Pick out a polish.
He looks like a player.
Ah. Never mind.
I thought we said no guys.
I am not touching his feet.
I'm not kidding you.
That's amazing.
Where's what's his name?
We are actually gonna meet up later, because...
he's got a little surprise for me.
Spoiler: it's his penis.
Okay, stop. Enough.
Pay attention.
You're from Oregon?
Yeah.
I'm from Oregon.
Oh, no. What?
I mean, how often do you meet Oregonians?
I don't know.
Oh, could you hold on one second?
Yeah. Sure.
Okay.
Oh, my God, he's from Oregon; I'm from Oregon.
Bad idea.
No, you can't do this.
Horrible.
I'm sorry.
You bonded emotionally.
If you end up having sex with him, it's gonna be missionary with a lot of eye contact.
Look, that is not one-night-stand material.
You got to listen to him.
He's right on this one. Sorry.
I know what I'm talking about.
I have my 10,000 hours.
Outliers.
You should read it.
Malcolm Gladwell.
It's one of my desert island books.
Along with Machiavelli's
The Prince,
Freak by John Leguizamo, any of the scripts from the first season of Vampire Diaries,
a little Phantom T.
I love Phantom Tollbooth.
Of course you do ... you're a human being.
So no connection?
Zero.
Sorry, babe. No.
Good girl.
* *
Hey.
Could I have your cherry?
Sure.
Cool.
Sorry.
You okay, lady?
Hmm.
Schwing!
Hey, guys. Um...
this is Oliver.
Um, Oliver is a...
Web creator.
Web creator.
Uh, also, we both love... lunch.
Lunch.
Love lunch.
You're kidding.
Wow, what a coincidence.
When people talk about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, I'm, like...
What...
what?!
Is that?!
What about lunch, man?
You want another drink?
If I didn't know ya better, I'd think you're tryin'
to liquor me up!
Why are you talking like that?
Oh, Oliver...
we have nothing in common.
Yes! I have no emotional connection to him at all.
But I'm just gonna eat lunch off that butt.
So, what about you?
What about that redhead over there?
I thought you totally had that.
Oh, that's in process.
This is where I do this kind of, like, look thing, where, like, my confusion makes her confused...
and, then, also kind of hot.
Let me help you.
I'm gonna make her jealous.
All right, can you... can you stop?
Cece, you are way too beautiful.
She'll think she doesn't have a sh*t with me.
Can you stop looking at me like that, please?
What look? I'm not even looking at you.
The pouty one, the naughty baby Indian.
I just ate something spicy, and now my lip is swollen. Mm-hmm.
Baby! Hi!
Hey!
All right, just get in there, man.
Clean it all out.
Like a dentist.
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey-hey!
Wow!
Look, look.
Surprise!
'Shrooms.
Oh, Kyle, you really shouldn't have.
I ate three.
I ate three. Three.
On a pizza!
Look at you, man.
You're a champion.
Okay, um, we're gonna go, 'cause he's about to get real handsy and a little r*cist.
So, you'll watch Jess?
Yeah, yeah, I will.
Okay. Let's go, Kyle.
Schmidtty, Schmidtty, Schmidtty.
Hey, um, so, I'm gonna go home with Oliver.
Great! I'm so happy...
Hey, three words:
Double bag it.
I got that covered. Um...
These guys...
hundy bag, so...
A hundred condoms?
What, are you gonna have sex with an army?
* Oh, I'm gonna *
* Get up in it, mon. *
That's the biggest box of condoms I've ever seen, honestly.
Does it have, like, a roller?
Like, you know, you go through the airport with it?
I'm gonna rip him a new one.
Very intimidating.
A normal man can go maybe three times in a night, depending on how much salmon he's had.
He's literally the most boring person I've ever met.
He's described every lunch he's had this week, and three of them were tacos.
My work here is done.
Not really.
Little favor. He doesn't have a car, I don't have a car,
'cause I came with you, so I...
No, no, no, no.
No. No.
One of the tacos had extra cheese, and the other one had avocados.
And cheese.
And cheese, actually.
Well, I guess it's time to take that Chinese head out of that Chinese ass, Ming.
That's so sweet.
I love that. Thank you.
Hey, I pushed the reservation to 8:30.
Okay, I just need
40 to 50 more minutes, okay?
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
Hey, Confucius say: "You work for me."
What, Winston?
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry to call you ... I know you're at dinner.
No, I'm not, Winston. I'm actually hanging out with a guy named Cliff.
Are we hanging out?
That's awesome.
Listen here, man, I'm at Shelby's house.
And there's two other girls here.
They're drinking cranberry juice, talking about Michelle Obama's upper-body workout.
I got a nose strip on my face, man.
So leave.
It's just that...
I really enjoy being around this girl.
All right, so stay.
You know what, I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna...
Can I ask you something?
With her, the...
is it... is it gentle, or is it... not so gentle?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I'm gonna act like you didn't just say that, Cliff. - Fair enough.
Yeah, Ming, I got your text.
What-what part of that did you not understand?
Do you want some champagne, Cliff?
What is that?
Is he injured?
No, I think...
Pause. Pause.
Why are you pausing?
Bathroom break.
It's right in the middle of the movie.
What are... What's wrong with him?
Why are you still here?
You don't have a car, he doesn't have a car;
How you gonna get home?
I'm gonna take a cab, Schmidt.
It's a horrible neighborhood, okay?
There are youths everywhere.
Youths? Are you Officer Krupke?
Would you st...
Damn it.
It's Cece. Hello?
Why are you crashing Jess's one-night stand?
Well, he asked me if I wanted to watch Planet of the Apes.
I didn't know he meant right now.
Ugh.
What's wrong with you?
Hate you. Tell him to leave.
Get out of there, Schmidt.
Leave your car there, and I'll come get you, okay?
What is going on over there?
Where are you; where's Kyle?
I'm at a playground.
Kyle's shrooming.
Woo-woo.
I'll see you guys later.
I love brown people!
That's r*cist, Kyle.
Excuse me.
Back to the movie.
Ready?
Yeah.
Yeah.
These monkeys look so real.
Apes.
They're apes.
Oh... you're one of those.
Get out.
Like there's a real difference?
Get out now!
All right.
Youths!
You know what, Cliff?
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling very romantic, and I have nowhere else to put it, so happy Valentine's Day, good looking.
You know what?
What?
Put it right here.
'Cause I-I like it.
So how did you get that far into law school and then drop out?
Well, I got my heart broken.
Yeah.
And then everything got weird.
I started playing guitar in an alt-country-ska band. - Sure.
Gambling a lot.
Yeah.
There was a really weird week where I wore a long blonde wig and I made everybody call me Sandy Ferguson.
I have never loved anyone that much.
Then I drove to Mexico, and I tried to enter a cockfight.
As a person?
Yes, Cliff, as a person.
Come on!
Get me out of here!
Help! Help!
I've had a tough couple of days, Freddie.
The point of the story is I looked around at my life and I realized that I didn't want to work for somebody else my whole life.
That is exactly how I feel, man.
Yeah, but the second half of that story is how I went broke and started working for somebody else my whole life.
Okay, what was that?
I don't want to be a lawyer.
I don't want to do this.
Don't do this. Not tonight.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving tonight.
Oh, Cliff.
Look what I found under a pile of depositions.
I'm quitting!
What?
Nick convinced me that I can't waste my life doing your stapling any more.
I never said anything like that, Julia.
Not doing it any more. I'm not working all night on Valentine's Day.
I'm just gonna get in my car, and I'm just gonna drive until I see the sun.
'Cause it's got to be shining somewhere.
And for once in my life, I'm gonna spend some time with my birds.
With you birds?
Woo! No, Cliff!
We're gonna start paying you so soon!
Julia, I am so sorry.
I just told him a story about when I got arrested in Mexico.
You got arrested in Mexico?
I wasn't gonna tell you until after you got knocked up and were stuck with me.
Now I got to do all this stuff.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Just go home, Nick.
Sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.
No!
What?
Are you kidding me?
Hey, baby.
Uh, this is my ex, Amy.
We broke up last week.
She can't afford to move out
= 'cause she doesn't work.
= What?
Hey, so how was your night?
Are you serious right now, Oliver?
Yeah.
Um, hey.
I'm Jess.
Hey.
Who is she?
What are you doing here, Cece?
Sorry, I just came to get Schmidt.
Schmidt left, like, an hour ago.
No, no, I didn't.
Are you kidding me?
My tires were stolen by street youths.
Ugh!
Hey, did I pee my pants?
Friends, did I pee in my pants?
Guys?
No, Kyle, you're just on drugs.
He definitely peed, I can see.
See! See!
Who's the idiot now?
Okay, all of you, get out of here.
I peed my pants.
We got to get out of... oh.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This guy's like a magician.
How does it feel, Oliver?
Okay, uh, Kyle, I'm the one you're gonna sleep with tonight, so we got to...
What are you gonna do now?
Okay, okay.
Okay.
My man!
Get out of my house!
I will m*rder you!
Bye!
What?
Hey, Kyle. Hey.
It's a stick.
Go get it.
Ooh, shiny!
Whoo.
What does a girl got to do to get a one-night stand around here?
Sorry.
This sangria is amazing, Winston.
My grandmother's recipe, so I can't take credit for that.
But seriously, Tia, you don't want a man who has fancier underpants than you.
I keep trying to tell her that.
It's true.
You want to have the fanciest drawers in the relationship.
Boom.
Wow.
Hmm.
Hey, are you gonna be done soon?
Maybe.
She can't keep eating tacos all night.
Yeah.
Because I ate most of the tacos yesterday.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You're a really great guy, and, um, I-I I mean, I don't know that, um, but honestly, I was just gonna use you as a giant meat puppet.
I'm looking pretty good right now.
It's just so hard, you know?
I feel so alone sometimes.
And I lied to you.
I'm not a Web creator.
I'm not a player.
I miss her so much.
Oh, she's in... she's just in the kitchen.
Baby!
Can you make me a smoothie?
You know, just making copies.
Did you do all of this?
I did.
No.
Yeah.
Really?
And I just want you to know that there's a photocopy of my butt somewhere in your recycling bin.
Okay.
I had a weird moment, Julia, and I went for it.
Okay, and if anyone finds it, I want them to know that I moved during the copy, and I don't actually have two butt cracks.
I know.
What?
I've never ever cared about Valentine's Day before.
Neither have I.
But it's nice.
Yeah.
Right?
You did all the work wrong, though.
Yeah, I know I did.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, do what you got to do.
Hi, Ming.
Yeah, I got your text.
And yeah, it was wrong just like every single other text you've sent me tonight.
Call I call you tomorrow?
Yeah, it's fine, go.
I'm sorry.
Are you really...
Are you arguing with me about that?
Are you actually arguing with me about that?
Bye.
Bye, girl, thank you.
Bye.
Bye, Shel.
That was fun.
Any time.
So, you weren't expecting a girls' night, were you?
Not really.
You know, Tia needed some tough love.
You keep doing it.
What?
Making up for how you used to be.
You don't remember?
Valentine's Day, 2008?
You said you'd call.
You didn't.
Um...
I waited all night.
Okay, I don't deserve a second chance with you, do I?
But here you are.
Getting one.
Oh.
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing home so soon? - Well, I helped him get back together with his ex-girlfriend.
He made me video-chat with his mom in Hawaii for a couple minutes, and then, um, I came home, so...
Jess, you don't your first one-night stand to be with some total stranger.
You got to pick someone who you know, who's not gonna make a big deal out of the whole thing.
Hmm. - You have an urge, you act on it.
And...
whatever you do, leave immediately afterwards.
God help you if you get sucked into a brunch.
Thanks, Schmidt.
Come here.
You smell good.
It's probably the oil of the ylang-ylang tree.
Don't over think it.
Okay.
Don't over think it.
Don't over...
Don't over think it.
Schmidt?
Hey, Jess, what are you doing?
I was asking Schmidt a question.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Were you...?
What? No.
...with Schmidt?
No! No.
I was holding those, but I...
Oh, my God.
What has gotten into you?
No. No.
And why do you have so many condoms?
Shh! Don't ever...
Shh! Don't ever speak of this again.
You need one.
Tops, two. Let's go.
We'll get these later.
I was feeling twirly.
Nick, Nick...
No!
You're not having sex with Schmidt.
NICK This is a danger zone for you.
What is happening out there?
Stop, do not move, okay?
What? Why...? - Because if somebody catches us, I'm gonna say that you drugged me, and it's my word against yours.
Okay?
Okay, yeah.
That-that's fine, that makes sense.
You smell so good right now.
You are not gonna believe the stupid thing I almost did last night.
Tell me.
Okay, but have to promise never to tell anyone, ever.
Of course, out with it.
Tell me.
Okay, I almost tried to hook up with Schmidt last night.
That would have been crazy.
I know!
Can you imagine? Ugh.
I cannot.
I got to go, okay?
Bye.
(Horn honks)
NICK: Hey, hey, hey, man, this is my spot.
I was here first!
That's my space, huh?
This isn't Europe! Move!
Come on. Come on, Nick.
Maybe he's a really nice guy. He's just having a bad day.
I don't care if he's a nice guy.
Get that piece of crap out of my space.
Don't... - Come on, dude. Why don't you come in here, Nick!
...take my pants off...and kiss my ass?
Oh! Oh, my God!
What do you got to say now? Huh?
Oh, my God, it's like The Wire!
He has a g*n. He has a g*n. Stay down.
Oh, my God. You still think he's a nice guy, Jess?
That's what I thought.
Maybe no one's ever been nice to him.
Maybe v*olence is his only tool to express himself.
Hi. - Huh? Get down. What are you doing?!
JESS: Hi. Don't k*ll us.
Don't use g*n!
Stop it. Just stop it. Just get down.
We're sorry. Take the spot.
JESS: Sir...
Just be submissive.
Sorry about this guy.
Don't apologize...
He's overreacting.
I'm overreacting? He has a g*n, and you're dressed like a bull's-eye.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I can't believe this is working.
Sorry. - You out-crazied a man with a g*n.
Have a good day.
See, it worked.
You always see the worst in people.
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ Who's that girl? ♪ ♪ It's Jess.
Here we go again.
Another text message from work. Look at that.
"Tokyo call at 11:00?"
This is driving me crazy!
What is she trying to say?
I'm not an expert at your industry at all, but, um, sounds like there's a call.
From Tokyo.
Sometime today.
Oh, wait. At 11:00.
You don't understand.
I've been getting a lot of mixed signals from my boss lately.
What is wrong with you?
The world is not out to seduce you.
(phone buzzing) "And bring me the budget reports."
Why can't she just say what she wants?
What kind of sick game is she playing?
It's all in your head, man. It's always in your head.
Nonfat vanilla latte.
We're not talking about coffee...
are we?
Three, please.
Are you sure you want me to...
stop at three?
I have a package for Schmidt.
Sir, I'm very flattered, but I must decline.
He said he had a package for Schmidt. JESS: Oh, you're always starting fights with everyone, Nick.
I mean, not everyone's out to get you.
He had a g*n, Jess!
He was literally out to get me.
Isn't Nick the most negative person you've ever met?
Absolutely, and you know what? It all pools up right in that little satinous center below his belly button.
WINSTON: I mean, he's not wrong, though.
His life is genuinely terrible. NICK: You know what, Jess?
I guess I don't live in a world where I smile, and people do what I want them to do.
You never smile.
A smile is a sign of weakness.
(screams, whirring)
No!
All right, everybody relax.
(whirring)
(clanking, Nick groaning)
Get out!
It's fixed.
Okay, Nick, I'm calling the landlord.
Uh-uh.
This is ridiculous.
Don't call the landlord.
We don't need him here, and he's a jerk.
See, here's an example.
Maybe you never gave him the chance to show you what a great guy he is.
Yeah, he's a terrible person. No, Jess. He sucks.
Don't call the landlord, I'm serious.
Okay.
Hey, Kim, where should I put this...
budget... report?
On the desk.
Yeah, um, okay.
I'll just... Thanks. So...
Schmidt, my files need sorting.
Do it here... so I can watch.
Okay.
So, you want me to...
sort... your files?
Is that right?
What are you doing?
What am I...? Hmm? Okay.
Because I probably got this one wet, so I'm gonna re...
I'm just gonna replace all of them.
(scraping)
Knock, knock. Mr. Landlord?
Um, I know you probably think cupcakes are totally lame.
I know I do, so if you could do me a solid and take care of those extras?
Cool office.
I like your...
bucket of...
gasoline.
It's super practical.
What you got there?
Broom.
So, I live in, um, Four D...
There are a lot of real safety hazards in our loft.
Nothing a little landlording couldn't fix.
What do you say?
No.
(water dripping)
That's a sweet picture.
How old are your kids?
I did that.
It's me and my ex-wife.
Okay, you know what? Um...
My roommates are really scared of you, but I know you're a good man, and I know you don't want the four of us living in a dangerous apartment.
The four of you?
Apartment Four D, there's only supposed to be three people.
Oh, did I say four?
You know what?
I was counting myself twice.
It's so easy to do.
Big personality over here, so...
gonna go...
(mutters)
Hey, guys.
I've got a fun exercise.
I'd like everybody to take a moment and think back to a time when they did something stupid, how they were treated, and how they wish they were treated.
What did you do, Jess? LANDLORD (knocking): Open up!
Did you talk to the landlord?
Little bit.
Okay, it's happening. Guys, go.
Ginny. Call me Ginny. Ginny.
Ginny. I'm Ginny. Okay, go.
We'll be right there. Come on, let's go. Go, go. Okay, okay.
NICK: Come on, this is what we trained for, guys.
Go! All the way, all the way, all the way.
Be careful with the duvet, please.
Shut up, Schmidt! I'm freaking out!
Oh, my God. - Told you we didn't practice this enough.
Jess, close those up.
Oh, there goes the chinos.
Oh!
Brad. Coach.
(heavy accent): Oh. Hello. (laughs)
Ginny! I had such nice time visiting Los Angeles.
It's so many fancy people with their fancy lives.
Oh. Hollywood!
Oh.
Oh, good-bye.
Bye, Ginny.
Yeah, Ginny.
Thank you for memories.
Bye, Ginny.
Ginny. You're the best, Ginny.
Oh, I'll miss him.
I love Ginny.
So, someone told me you have four people living here.
NICK:
Well, that idiot probably doesn't know what she's talking about, so...
You don't want... you don't want to go in the library...
Who left the library like this?
You kidding me? Oh!
Know what? This is so embarrassing. Who left the library like...?
This is a mess.
Hey, hey, where you going, my man?
Oh. Hello.
Train to Panama all sold out.
Must be the Mardi Gras.
Good God, what is this?
Why would you do this?
This was Schmidt's room, okay? He painted this.
It is a sexually-charged, zero-gravity tea ceremony.
Paint over it!
Or you pay for it.
(mutters):
He's fair.
Who painted that?
Giancarlo.
Some creepo Schmidt was obsessed with.
He used to wear a le...
I suggest you paint it, and you paint it fast!
Have fun, buddy.
To be honest, I was expecting a lot worse, so just...
Four people is fine.
Just paint over the sex wall, and don't bother me any more.
Hey, sir, wait.
Jess, let.. let him go.
I just want to apologize on behalf of all of us for lying to you about how many people live here.
Stop reminding him.
But while you're up here, might as well just fix a few things.
Please... Remy?
How did you know my name? They call you?
I saw your tattoo that says,
"Hello, My Name is Remy,"
and I just... I took a leap of faith.
Look, I know you're a good guy...
Okay, what do you... what do you want fixed?
Why don't you close your eyes and point at something?
Her. Not you.
Schmidt?
Yeah.
I need you to clean up my hard drive.
Okay, do you want me to reformat first? - I said, I need you...
to clean up...
my hard drive.
I should have seen a divorce coming.
You know, we stopped doing the little things, like talking.
One day, we were humping.
Then everything changed.
We weren't humping.
That must have been really hard.
You know, it was what it was.
Come on, Remy.
It was hard.
It was hard.
Mm.
All right, give it a sh*t.
Great.
Okay. Oh.
Here, I'll help...
I'll brace you. Pull back.
Okay.
Use your hips. Come on.
Okay...
Oh! Oh, that's good.
That's it, is it?
Okay.
That'll do it.
Hey, Jess.
Can I talk to you for a minute alone?
(sighs)
(laughs)
So, what's up? Ready to admit you were wrong?
Hello. My name is Nick, and I like eating crow.
That man wants to sleep with you.
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does. - He was just showing me how to close a closet.
Okay, anytime a man shows a woman how to do something from behind, it's just an excuse for him to get really close and breathe on her neck.
Watch any sports movie.
That is not a thing.
You mind picking up that mug?
Oh, no, you're doing it all wrong.
Here, let me show you.
No, no, no. I've been doing this for years.
See, the way to pick up a mug is like that.
You just got to relax into it.
He wasn't doing that!
That's exactly what he was doing.
You always see the worst in people!
Yeah, because people are the worst!
Oh, five bucks!
Look out, college. Here I come!
(laughs)
That's it. People stink!
You must have been doing something.
Are you seriously defending the man who pushed me into the bushes?
Well, people can be good.
You just have to give them a chance to show you.
MAN: Hey, little girl. You like candy?
I sure do!
Great!
My nana made way too much!
Why can't you admit you were wrong?
I was nice, and now he's fixing our apartment.
I'm working up an appetite in there.
Boy, I hope you don't mind the smell of a real man in your room.
Let me know when you want to get started on that bed.
Okay.
He's turning my mattress.
Yeah.
This is so wonderful.
Oh, come on.
Don't you ever wear jeans? Honestly, you look like you should be distracting James Bond at a baccarat table.
No, I'm actually gonna go meet Kyle.
Jess loaned her seasickness bracelets.
Going to a party on Greg Kinnear's boat.
You're going to a party on Neptune's Folly?
Yeah, relax. He's not going to be there.
I know, he's in Rio till the 16th.
Cece, can I talk to you, as a...
as a woman?
All right, Schmidt.
Okay.
My boss and I, we're running a Pre-Sex Marathon right now, and I feel like we're stuck in mile 25.
I'm cramping, Cece, my toenails are falling off, I'm peeing down my leg, it's like I can see the finish line, but I just can't get there.
I need to put one of these on right now.
The problem is is we don't talk.
I don't know what she's thinking.
Should I make a move or not?
Stop asking permission and go get it.
That's what I would want.
There's nothing less sexy than a dude asking if he can kiss you.
Nothing? I mean, what if I ate my own hair and pooped out a wig?
What if I called my mom after sex to describe it to her?
What if I had a croissant blog?
Two of these now.
(laughing)
Hey, Bob Ross, how's painting going?
Going absolutely fantastic, Schmidt, because everything is easy...
"when you are a battleship, invading the Bay of Success."
What?
I have here Schmidt's New Year's resolutions from 2007.
Oh, please, read on. NICK: Read my favorite one.
"Stop pursuing Caroline.
"She's Nick's girl.
Deal with it.
"Deal with it." CECE: Wow!
She's my girl.
Okay, where'd you find that?
Do not ever stop reading this.
I was very young. And drunk.
Were you too drunk to "begin the search for the cocoon..." - Cocoon.
...that will one day release your butterfly"?
No, it does not say that one!
That's number three.
Come on!
Why are you doing this to me?
Maybe I just got bored painting over your interplanetary ass dojo.
This is my favorite.
"Find out where Winston gets his sparkle, and then steal it."
Oh!
Steal his...! You were gonna steal my sparkle?
Give me that.
The funniest thing just happened.
I was watching Remy fix the sink, and I got totally soaked.
You were so wet!
Man overboard!
So I invited Remy over for dinner to thank him for all the stuff he's been doing around the apartment. Who's in?
I gotta... I...
I got a boat, so...
So, I guess it'll just be me and Jess.
Oh, no, Remy.
I changed my mind;
I'll be there.
Just watching you.
Remy brought a bottle of...
this?
I ferment things in the basement.
I also make cheese.
Hm, you're not drinking that, Jess.
Yes, I am, Remy made it.
Ahhh.
Think you can handle some, Nick?
Oh, I'm okay.
Somebody needs to stay sober to fight you later.
Nick, be nice;
How hard could it be to just open yourself up a little bit?
Dip your toe in the pool of possibilities.
Yeah, Nick.
Dip your toe.
You guys have a lot in common.
Nick went through a break-up last year that was really hard on him.
Schmidt said your mom had to fly out.
That was a scheduled trip.
Did you smell your girl on your sheets for months until they were too soaked through with your own sweat and tears?
No.
Did you punch out all the windows until you h*t the wall and broke your hand?
Did you go out, looking for companionship, a little human warmth, only to come to in the woods covered in animal blood?
In my own way.
Come here, man.
(sighing, panting)
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll just go home and open a bottle of wine.
Yeah, I'll probably just do the same.
(murmurs)
(beeps)
(car alarm blaring)
I want you.
Now.
Finally.
(tires screech)
No, no, no, no, she wanted me to! Oh, dip!
No, no! Stop! Stop hitting him! She wanted me to! Consensual, guys!
Tap out, ow, tap out!
(laughter)
Oh, man, tonight is just...
I-I honestly didn't know if I'd ever enjoy myself again.
So... thanks.
Bathroom break.
(clears throat)
See?
I was right.
What do you mean, you're right?
You're wrong.
You see the way he's buttering me up so he can move in on you?
Why can't you just admit that you were wrong?
How have you lived this long on your own?
There is no part of that man that wants to sleep with me.
He's been creeping on you all night.
No, he hasn't been.
Open your eyes, like, I'm worried...
No!
Oh...
Hey, Remy, what happened to your pants?
I've never done a threesome.
That's what we're doing here, right?
This I did not expect.
I love watching you be wrong, Jess.
I might've been a little bit off about Remy, but people are generally good, and I'm not wrong about that.
Jess, people are jerks.
He is hurting from his divorce...
Are you still making excuses for this guy?
Well, look, if you feel so bad, then just get in there.
Just dip your toe into the pool of possibility.
Hey, Remy, let's get weird and toss that ball around, huh?
So turned on.
Okay, you would seriously have a threesome with that man just to get me to admit that I'm wrong?
I think we could do a lot worse than Remy.
He's got strong arms.
Let's have a threesome.
Ugh...
All right, so, a menage
a trois is about three of us... trois...
Sure.
...Menage-ing fully.
Oui.
Okay.
This is happening with this guy.
This is happening right now, Jess.
Yeah.
So, it's gonna get even a little more uncomfortable.
We just have to keep talking with each other, all right?
Around and communicating.
Let's get some relax music going.
Great idea, great idea.
Okay? All right.
Thank you. Why can't you just admit that he's a good guy?
We are about to have a menage a
trois 'cause you won't admit you're wrong. You're out of your mind.
I'm just saying he's a good guy.
♪
Yeah, get into it.
I am so into this.
I can't wait till we're all menage-ing.
Are you into this, Jess?
Yeah.
Say you're wrong. No, turn this up. It's great.
Say it's over, and it's over.
Don't get nervous, Nick.
This is just a regular conversation we're having.
Oh, yeah.
Except I'm rubbing your back.
That's right.
And then I'm going to start unbuttoning your pants, and then I'm gonna unbutton my shirt.
I'm not gonna take my underpants off, though.
Not right away, I'm gonna keep my underpants on until I let you take my underpants off, Nick.
Okay? Because you are gonna be the underpants captain tonight. - Makes sense.
Great choice, Remy.
Nick will make a fantastic underpants captain.
Let's bring it in.
Okay.
You two get us started.
Me and Jess get it started?
Yeah.
All right?
Us two...
Go ahead.
...getting it started.
You know what to do.
Breathe into each other.
Oh, yeah, Jess.
I'm not here.
Relax into the menage.
Let's get this started, Nick.
You doing this? - Yes.
Come together.
Are you doing this? Cause I'm...
Yes.
I will do it.
All right, okay.
We're gonna do it.
Then let's do this.
Nick, I will do this.
Say that you're wrong, and it's over.
I'm not wrong.
Jess, you can't do this.
But I can.
Okay.
Let's do this, Nick.
Let's do it, Jess.
I can do it.
(muffled yell)
No, okay!
Fine, I admit it, I'm wrong.
Yes! Yes!
I'm sorry, Remy.
REMY:
What, we're not doing this?
JESS: No. NICK: We're not doing it.
I get it, cold feet is just, you know, it's part of the journey, so...
Whoa!
What is going on in here?
All right, I am not ready for a four-way.
That's, uh, I'm-I'm...
I'm out of this.
To be honest, I'm kind of riding a weird ego high.
Why didn't you tell me four people couldn't live in this apartment?
If we're gonna do a shenanigan, I'm fine with doing shenanigans.
I love shenanigans, as long as no one gets hurt.
(loud popping, Jess screams)
Okay, just so we're clear, we're gonna have to live with this, right?
Yep.
Absolutely.
SCHMIDT:
Hey, Kim?
Look, I just wanted to apologize for yesterday.
I hope you didn't get into too much trouble, I just...
I really don't want to lose my job, okay?
I've worked at Associated Strategies for six years.
Nothing means more to me than Ass Strat.
Your lip is bleeding.
It opens back up when I talk.
Look... Kim, this wasn't your standard 2:00 a.m.
mistaken as*ault in the parking garage.
I've had a thing for you every since I was the husky kid in the mailroom.
And if... if you don't believe me...
here you go.
Straight from '07. Read resolution number four.
It's about you.
"Only think about hot new C.F.O. Every other time I masturbate."
I did not live up to the challenge.
Number seven: "Start floating idea that people call me"
"Mr. Finish/Garee Time Jones/
The Hook-up-erator."
Can I...?
Number nine: "Just pick a color of Crocs and buy them already."
Okay, thank you.
Hey.
Go into the conference room and dial me into the Tokyo call.
Now.
Yeah.
♪
Pants! Pants!
(sighs)
(counting in Japanese)
...five, six...
I dialed you into the Tokyo conference call.
(clicks tongue)
(confused murmuring)
Yo... you look awesome.
(elevator bell dings)
My door is always open.

Your sheets are so soft.
They've actually been in my family for almost 40 years.
Wow!
If these old things could talk, huh? Ew.
I was just trying to paint a picture.
Read the room.
Sheez.
Hey, Julia. Hey.
It's so fun having another girl around here.
There are tampons hidden all over the apartment.
Ah! Damp towel! Damp!
Here we go... It's like a really big Wet-Nap.
Ah. I feel like I'm being licked by a golden retriever.
Look at this bathroom.
There should not be two girls in this bathroom.
You're too humid. You make everything damp.
80% of the products in here are yours.
Blah, blah, blah, yawn, yes.
I use sculpting chutney.
Once I'm done with my chutney, back in the row it goes.
Hair everywhere... Yo.
The multicolored rubber bands.
I'm fine with it. It's all okay with me.
But a damp towel is where I draw the line.
Sorry, so what are your thoughts on damp towels?
Oh, you'd better watch it, Nick's Overnight Guest.
Julia. I know your name.
Are you flexing, right now? No.
Hey. Hey.
So, I'm gonna just get ready in your room.
Sure. Feeling a little weird and uncomfortable in here?
Hey, Julia, I'll see you later tonight.
Yeah. See you later.
She's helping me get out of a traffic ticket.
Jess, are you seriously using the girl I'm sleeping with for free legal advice?
Oh, I'm sorry, the girl you're sleeping with?
I mean, you can't call her your girlfriend?
We're not labeling it. Oh, you're not labeling it,
'cause you're too sophisticated.
Don't do your
"sophisticated guy."
That's now how a sophisticated man dances.
How does a sophisticated man dance?
# I'm too sophisticated
# I don't believe in labeling. #
You gotta get laid, man. You gotta get laid, man.
Yeah, I need to get laid.
This is bad. Get out of here.
# Who's that girl?
# Who's that girl? #
# Who's that girl?
# Who's that girl? #
# It's Jess.
You know, maybe I should call Shelby.
I haven't seen her since I got back from Latvia.
We did have an amazing time together.
Whoo! That was amazing.
Yeah. All right, bye.
I'm gonna call her.
Yeah, over in Latvia they had this fermented milk stuff that they drink.
Whole country runs on the stuff. Called.
was definitely one of my biggest endorsements.
I mean, I have a lot of endorsements, but that was probably my biggest endorsement amongst other endorsements that I had.
Wow.
So, um... your place or mine?
What are we laughing at?
How much I'm not going home with you tonight.
You show up after two years, out of the blue, and all you do is talk about yourself.
You don't even let me get a word in edgewise.
Why did you agree to let me take you out for drinks?
Winston, you took me out for a drink at the place where I work!
Here's your bill.
Thanks for the water.
Man, I told you to get yourself whatever you wanted.
You chose water.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Let me get you a blanket.
Why would I want a blanket right now?
Just to get toasty. Oh.
Would you like a cookie, or a cupcake? I made them.
Oh, no. I'm okay. I'm not really a dessert person.
I just don't eat it, usually. Okay. Okay.
I'm just gonna put this, like, right here.
I don't... okay. Just...
Why don't you just take me through what happened with the ticket?
Okay. They got a photo of you?
# At the scene of the crime
# Meh, meh, meh, meh.
Is this it?
Yeah. Okay.
Hmm. This may actually be kind of hard to argue with.
Well, there's actually more there than meets the eye.
Um, there was a bird ... he's not in the sh*t ...
but he was injured, and he couldn't get out of the road, and so I braked, and then I had to accelerate out of the intersection.
You missed your first court date on this.
My ex-boyfriend failed to send it to me before the court date, because he doesn't believe in mail, which has to do with his thoughts on government spending.
Now it's an $800 fine.
That's why I need, like, a really awesome lawyer, like you.
So... can you help me?
I mean, I can try. You never know.
A judge might buy into this whole thing, so...
What "whole thing"?
Your whole thing.
With the cupcakes, and the braking for birds, and... bluebirds come and help me dress in the morning.
Oh, I didn't know I was doing a thing.
It's a great thing. I mean, the big, beautiful eyes, like a scared baby.
I'm sure that gets you out of all kinds of stuff.
Yeah. Yeah, except my peripheral vision's, like, almost too good.
Hey, so...
living here, it's probably fun, right?
Yeah. There are, like, lots of girls coming in and out of this place?
Schmidt's like Ellis Island in the 1800s.
He accepts everyone.
Yeah, and... Winston and Nick...
I probably shouldn't...
Oh, yeah. Well, you don't have to... Plead the Fifth!
No, that's not what... Objection!
Nick, hey! Hey, Julia!
You want to hang out in your room? Sure.
Jess, if you'll excuse us, Julie's about to be very disappointed.
Okay, so I will look at this stuff some more, I-I'll call some people, see what I can do.
Here's your blankie back.
Power blazer. Hey. Ha ha.
What's going on with the ticket?
She has a problem with me, Nick.
Okay? She doesn't like me. What are you talking about?
You don't understand,
'cause you're a guy.
She does not have a problem with you. She's just...
Nick, your girlfriend's not a dessert person.
Hmm.
She said you have
"a whole thing"?
I'm sorry, she doesn't like desserts?
Where is she right now?
Look, I think I know what she meant.
I mean, you do like girly stuff.
I mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.
When I met you, you were wearing a hat made of ribbons.
My ribbon hat. I love that hat.
Screw her. And I'm gonna wear that ribbon hat.
Go get it, right now.
Be right back.
Whoa. There she is.
Nick, where is this bitch?
Gonna smack that lawyer learning right out of her mouth.
Okay, this is getting excessive, guys.
She's actually helping her get out of a ticket.
By being condescending and judgmental?
What did she say?
Ugh, just drop it, Nick.
Okay, what did Julia do wrong?
It's just how girls fight sometimes.
There's a lot unsaid.
Like one time, a girl said to me,
"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots."
Ooh. How did she say it?
"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots."
That is diabolical. I'm really sorry.
And it ruined our friendship.
I mean, I couldn't get over the polka dot incident.
Warning! Spoiler alert.
Somebody unplugged my dehumidifier to plug in their flatiron.
I will be putting my dehumidifier, and my towel, in my room, where nothing ever gets wet.
All right, you know what, Jess? Julia's one of those girls where she doesn't have, like, a lot of girl friends.
Because she thinks like a guy. She doesn't play mind games.
So blind! Look, all I know is she's totally up front with me.
No subtext, no codes.
Oh. Okay. So did she come right out and ask you if you were seeing other girls?
Because... she asked me.
She did? You didn't know that?
'Cause I thought you guys were so up front with one another.
I thought you guys told each other everything. Yeah.
She told him she didn't want to label it.
Oh. I mean, that's a classic move, even in the lesbian community.
What are we talking about?
Did you just hear the phrase
"lesbian community"
and come running out of your room?
I did. Uh...
question, for you.
This community you speak of, do the ladies look, uh...
more like this one or, you know...
kind of Nickish? Aw, shut up, Schmidt.
I did date a woman who looked a lot like Nick.
You did. Felicia.
Why can't you just admit that she's your girlfriend?
I know, I just thought it was uncomplicated, and now I'm freaking out.
I'm not good at being a boyfriend.
I'm good at being that guy that you find yourself spending more and more time with until you meet your husband.
All right. So, so far, Nick Miller's list of fears is sharks, tap water, real relationships.
And blueberries. Barkeep.
Get this man a drink.
Ladies, he hasn't had sex in four months.
Come and get it, ladies.
I seriously hate you, Schmidt. Why?
It didn't go well with Shelby?
I gotta say, I thought it would be easy.
You know? Maybe...
maybe I don't have game. Maybe I never had game.
Maybe it's always been about basketball.
Yeah, you don't have any game.
It's always been because you play basketball.
Are you seriously just realizing that you don't have game?
What is your secret, man? How do normal guys get girls?
Let's not say "normal."
Just, you know, say what it is ... "average."
You've had the most game, out of any of us.
Because for years now, you've been working with absolutely nothing.
He makes a good point. Okay.
I've been working with nothing. Zilch.
You're right, I've got nothing.
Except this.
Ow.
Oh, my God.
Miller! No Cocktail!
Sorry, Julio.
Julia! Hey, Julia!
Hey.
Ooh. You guys are using names?
That's not too labelly for you?
Hey. Hey, hey, Jules.
Hey.
Thought I'd drop by and say hello.
Oh, I didn't know we were doing drop-bys.
Uh...
Here's a scenario that's paid sexual dividends, particularly in the Asian markets, and I think, Jess, you can back me up on this.
Inform her that you're an aerialist for the Cirque du Soleil.
Winston, just ask questions, pay attention to her, listen to her, don't listen to him.
Oh, believe me, I don't take advice from Schmidt.
Never have, never will. Ever.
So Jess told me what you asked her yesterday. What?
That you asked if I was sleeping with other people.
That is not even... I... what?
I don't want to play games. That's not what happened, okay?
I just said something to h, because I was feeling kind of guilty, because I'm, uh...
I'm dating other people, and I just, you know... wanted to see if you were also dating other people.
You're dating other people?
Yeah, yeah.
No. No, I'm seeing other people, too.
Good. Good.
I'm having sex all the time. I'm like a mailman.
Except instead of mail, it's hot sex that I deliver.
I've had to start carrying, like, athletic shoes in my purse, 'cause I have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another.
Can't wear heels.
Well, I'm having sex right now.
Under the bar.
And she's on top.
So figure that out.
Was that her?
Yeah.
Well, great. Great.
Then we're both doing the exact same thing.
And we're on the same page.
Kudos for not putting labels on things.
That is exactly what I want. It's my dream.
Just going to go to the bathroom really quickly.
Okay. Great.
Hey. Julia?
Are you serious?
Did Nick say some stuff to you?
Because I'm really sorry, and I want to explain...
Why would you tell him that I said that?
Do you know what that makes me look like?
Um...
I see what you're doing.
I know that I'm the mean lawyer girl who wears suits and works too much and you... you're the really fun teacher girl with all the colorful skirts and you bake things.
And eventually, Nick is going to come running to you and you'll tuck him in under his blankie and...
What is it with you and the blankie thing?
I never said the word blankie.
I don't talk like Teddy Ruxpin.
If I acted the way that you act when I was at work, nobody would listen to me.
Well, if I acted like you at work, my students would turn in really weird, dark dioramas, so...
I don't like you.
And I don't want to be your friend, so...
Fine. Can you leave, please?
Because...
I am about to start crying, and you are the last person that I want to cry in front of.
I want to cry, t, and...
where am I supposed to cry?
You can't monopolize the bathroom crying space.
Please go.
What are you doing, Jess?
Get out! I'm sorry.
Winston, what are you doing? Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
I have come here to listen to you.
Should I have interrupted you to tell you that?
Probably not.
So how... how are you?
Tell me about your life, and how is everything?
Winston, what am I supposed to do?
I was a booty call for two years, and then I was nothing for two years.
You show up bragging after all this time like nothing has changed.
What do you want me to think?
That I'm an idiot.
And you know what?
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just that since I've stopped playing ball, I realize I'm not that good at this.
And, quite frankly, you are way out of my league.
That is clear now.
But... I do hope this is not the last time I see you, but whatever you want, I'm cool with.
I got to get back to work.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll help you.
See?
I'm the manager.
Oh, you're the manager? Yeah.
Wow, that's amazing. It's okay.
Case 73.
Mr. Sandoval.
I see you have dressed for the occasion.
Oh. Hi.
You didn't have to come.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I said that I would be here, so I'm here. Don't worry.
I think I can handle it. Let's just get this over with so we can get out of here.
Your Honor.
Your Honor.
Your Honor.
These are the facts, Your Honor.
# Your Honor.
Case 74 ... Jessica Day.
Yes, sir. Yes, I'm present, sir. Okay, listen.
You just have to enter the plea yourself, all right, and then I'll do the rest.
Okay, okay. I got it, all right?
So you know, all you have to do is say... I got it! Thank you.
Okay. Okay. How do you plead?
Guilty. What?
Great. Pay your fine upstairs.
Well, I guess we're never going to know if the bird defense works.
Such a bummer, too.
We have this pool at my office.
Okay. Hey!
I got something to say to you, man.
What?
I brake for birds.
I rock a lot of polka dots.
I have touched glitter in the last 24 hours.
I spend my entire day talking to children.
And I find it fundamentally strange that you're not a dessert person.
That's just weird, and it freaks me out.
And I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown.
And I hate your pantsuit.
I wish it had ribbons on it or something to make it just slightly cuter.
And that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong.
Okay.
And I know you like Nick, and I'm not trying to interfere, but you should just talk to him about it.
Are you done?
I am almost done.
I'm about to go and pay this $800 fine, and my checks have baby farm animals on them, bitch.
That's the wrong way.
You moved.
You remember my old place?
The place in the hood?
No.
It was hood-adjacent. Whatever.
So, um... so this was nice.
Yeah, it was.
You want to know what I want to do now?
What?
Take you on a real date.
Why don't you call me?
Good night, Winston.
Winston, what's happening? Huh?
Yeah, good night.
What is wrong with you, man?
You got no game. That was so stupid.
Hey! Anyone!
My towel!
Can someone please get my towel?
It's in my room next to my Irish walking cape.
The... the bigger towel.
Not... do not touch the small one.
Okay, I left my towel in my room.
Nobody look.
Nobody look, yo.
We don't want to. Nobody look.
Seriously, no... no one's looking?
All right, forget it.
Aah! Damn it! See, he's a natural blond.
What shape is that supposed to be shaved into?
Think he's trying to force perspective.
Very funny. I got to get something off my chest.
No, Schmidt, there is an apron right over there ... go cover yourself.
You are Jewish. You're making me gayer.
Are you going to go on, like, a big wet towel rant?
No. This is now a sex rant.
To wit, six months ago, I thought getting a girl roommate would mean sex all the time ...
definitely with her friends and probably with her.
Are there women here?
Yeah, sure, more than ever.
But you ... not going to happen.
You, I will never give up.
And you... well, you sample from the gumbo pot.
I am in a damp bathroom full of naked women every day, and I hate it.
It's like a nightmare. I'm in a...
watermelon-themed apron with a...
A tampon?
Why would you need this for cooking?
I just had an idea.
Why don't we hang our towels on towel bars instead of hooks, and that'll make them dryer?
That is the...
that is... that is a great idea.
Quick question for you.
As a lesbian gynecologist, perhaps, one of these days, the two of us could sit down and talk about OSI.
What is OSI? Our shared interest.
Schmidt, clothe yourself! All right, all right.
It was just a suggestion.
Oh.
Hey. Hi.
Nick's not here.
That's okay.
Uh, because I came here to...
well, I kind of came because I-I thought it would be good if you and I...
Hey, Jess, my hands are actually stuck in the yarn because... Oh.
I didn't realize that you had people over. Sorry.
No, it's just... crochet time.
Yeah.
Nick's not here right now. No, I know.
Thanks.
I'll just come back later.
Hey, Julia.
Do you want to crochet with us?
I mean, growing up was brutal.
I went to an all-girls school.
The worst ... girls can be so mean to each other.
Yeah, Cece and I hid in the bathroom for four years.
This is... this is really nice, guys.
Thank you for letting me join in.
It's totally relaxing.
Except that I don't know why, if I put the fox through the cave, it doesn't... the yarn is broken.
I don't know why this is not turning into...
What you making?
A hat.
If you're making a hat for a baby, it is done.
Yeah.
Hey, Julia.
What are you doing here?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Okay.
Hey, Julia.
Stop.
No, there's something that I need to say to you.
All right. Then go ahead.
Okay. Okay.
I'm going to say it.
Okay, I... Just say it.
All right. I-I wanted to say that...
I don't want to date anybody else.
I just want to date you.
Well, that's what I was going to say to you.
Really? Yeah.
So, then... so, then, what does that mean?
You're, like, my boyfriend now?
I'm not really into labels.
Yeah, all right.
Boyfriend.
That's so lame.
You're totally going to...
carry my books home from school.
I will if you wear my leatherman jacket.
It's "letterman" jacket. No, I'm pretty sure it's a leatherman jacket. You letter...
The leather sleeves that the football guys wear?
I'm right. I'm right.
I'm glad you pitched a fit, because my towel is very dry.
I didn't pitch a fit. I just...
Damp!
Damn it!
Everybody ... bathroom now!
What's up, Dad?
What, Schmidt? Is someone playing a joke on me?
Honestly, why is my towel still damp?
cause it's not your towel;
it's my towel, Schmidt.
No, it's not your towel. Your towel is the red one.
I'll tell you this, pal.
I've never used that.
I do use that one every single day.
Oh, God.
This towel's so warm and fluffy.
It's like it's been in the sun forever.
This means you two have been drying your junk with the same towel. Intimate.
Are you out of your mind?! What do you mean, am I...
How do you think this is your towel? Do you even wash it?
No, I don't wash the towel;
the towel washes me.
Who washes a towel?
You never wash...? You wash your towel?
You never wash the towel? What am I going to do?
Wash the shower next? Wash a bar of soap?
You got to think here, pal. I'm furious right now.
I get out of the damn shower, I'm clean as a damn baby, and I use the towel. Let me ask you this.
Have you been wearing my underpants?
Sometimes, yeah. Who cares?
You guys don't wear each other's underpants?
You're lying. We all wear each other's underwear.
$50 in the douche bag jar?
Absolutely, man.
Yes, absolutely.
Why so much?
I feel like it should actually be more in the 100, 200 range, so that's a discount.
Think about what you did, Schmidt.
I lost it.
I lost the party bus.
The party bus for your birthday party?
Yeah.
Apparently, my business isn't as important as Frankie Muniz's.
They canceled my rez.
There's nothing I can do;
The party's off.
You should torch them on Yelp.
Actually, I can do it.
I have an account under the name Fantastic Jacques.
He's a French diplomat with very little patience.
Or you could just get another bus.
In two days?
Okay, yeah, sure, Winston.
W-Why don't I just go down to the party bus store, where all the party buses have a state-of-the-art sound system, a stripper pole, a love grotto, and a steering wheel in the shape of a boob.
You honk the nipple.
It's pretty awesome.
Just have the party at a bar.
Nick, this is it.
This is my 29th birthday party.
This is the year. After this, I don't know, it's just... just all darkness.

I'm not okay, Jess.
I had to cancel my birthday party.
It's social su1c1de.
I can feel my it factor going away.
And then what am I gonna tell Benjamin?
Why are you so worried about Benjamin?
He's your friend.
We have a very weird, girl-style friendship where we kind of hate each other.
We're bronemies.
He's my fremesis.
I'm so confused right now.
Okay, look, Benjamin and I... we were suitemates in college.
Benjamin, I can't wait to get to L.A.
We're going to have so much sex...
in the morning, in the afternoon, at bedtime.
Mmm, peanuts.
I'm telling you, man, I'm gonna run that town one day... You'll see.
I'm gonna write you a check right now for $100 million.
How do you like that?
Damn, dude.
And this is a real check.
You can cash it when I'm rich and awesome.
Give me about four years.
Do the song.

If it wasn't for Benjamin, I, I never would have become a Los Angeles baller.
Holla.
I changed everything about myself, Jess.
I lost all the weight, I changed my clothes, I even dropped my voice half an octave, but it wasn't enough.
I guess I'll just never be cool enough, Jess.
Okay, I've got it.
We are going to throw Schmidt a birthday party. - No.
Yes, 'cause it's his 29th birthday and we care.
Jess, Schmidt's world is different than ours.
They speak a different language.
They shorten every word to one syllable.
Okay, he once called an oven an "ovs."
He calls an airport "airp."
He called ketchup "ketch."
Last month he went to a party called Bros before Hos on the Moon.
What does that even mean?
And the dress code was "yacht flair."
What?
Schmidt has a friend who legally changed his middle name to Doin' It.
Yeah, Doin' It.
Just one word: Doinit.
You are not emotionally, ment*lly, and spiritually prepared to throw these d-bags a party.
I'm gonna do some research.
Actually, I'm sorry, I do have to go.
I apologize.
Where are you going?
And why are you wearing your jury duty pants?
I'm not, man, I'm just... mumble, mumble, mumble.
Come on, lawyer party...
the classic fifth date.
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna apologize for it.
I got nothing to apologize for.
I owe you nothing.
No, I'm having a really fun time.
I love wearing a Bill Cosby sweater in front of a bunch of lawyers who are younger than me.
Hello, I'm Bill Cosby, do you like pudding?
My son's name is Theo and his best friend is Cockroach.
That supposed to be Bill Cosby?
That's as good as I can do.
Let's see yours.
Would you like to hear How he really sounds?
Yes.
I want to get some more pudding.
That's the worst Bill Co... How about this?
I got a daughter named Rudy Huxtable, and she's the cutest of all my daughters.
I'm really glad that you're here with me.
Yeah, I'm happy you let me be here with you.
No, I really am because I got to, like, kiss all the asses of these 24-year-
old law students to try to get 'em to work here.
I went to law school.
You went to law school?
Yes.
I quit. Yes.
Quit law school... why?
Because I realized I hated lawyers.
He says to the lawyer.
And for some reason I find you ridiculously attractive for saying that.
Why don't you kiss my ass, then?
Look, Julia, I got turned around.
I thought we were doing a flirty back-and-forth...
I'm actually just kidding.
I really do want to do that.
Oh, you would?
Well, we can make that happen.
Great.
Let's go.
Let's go to your place.
Want to go to your place?
Do you mind?
Are you married or what?
No, no, no, n-no, no, no, n-no, I'm not married.
I am the opposite of married.
Before you, there was like, there was like nothing.
I've got, like, no girls on the horizon.
In a hot way.
Why don't you ever invite me to your place or, like, tell me all that much about yourself?
It's weird... I don't even know where you live.
I'm 30 years old, and I live in a loft with three roommates.
In a hot way.
But maybe you can kiss my butt when I talk like Bill Cosby.
All right, let's go.
Is that going to work?
Uh-huh.
Wow, weird stuff works with you.
Hi, yes, I'd like to order a last-minute stripper.
Oh, um, preferably of Asian heritage, very bendy, with a heart of gold and a crotch of gold.
Mm-hmm, yeah, I'll hold.
Hey, Jess, Winston, this is Julia.
Oh.
Hi.
We're just saying hi.
Nice to meet you guys.
Welcome to our home. Hold on one second.
We're doing a surprise party for Schmidt.
Who is that?
Oh, I didn't tell you about Schmidt?
No.
That's our other roommate.
Other roommate.
You know what? You should come.
It's on Saturday.
Yes.
Cool, yeah.
You should stay as far from that party as possible.
Is it like a presents thing or more like a donations to charity situation?
No?
Just bring yourself.
Do you want to head to my room for a little bit?
Give you the rest of the tour around the place.
Great, yeah.
Great.
Bye.
Hold on one second.
Hey, Winston, why'd you do that?
Are you hiding her from us?
Like, are you ashamed of your friends?
100%, and you're not my friend right now.
You're my enemy, Winston, my enemy.
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss.
No, that's the problem.
Thank you, Ms. Phatbooty, you're the best.
Yes, I just hired my first stripper.
Anything else I should get?
Do you like jazz cigarettes?
Hi, Tanya.
Patti told me that...
Patti told you to break in my office to look for drugs?
Hey, JK kidding, JK kidding.
You can do whatever you want.
I didn't know you liked to shop at the Confiscation Station.
So what are you looking for... grass?
'Cause I can do a locker search on Monday.
Monday's too late because...
Oh, so what do you got cooking this weekend, huh?
You have to tell me;
I'm your boss.
What is it, a list thing, Paperless Post?
I'm free Friday, but I can also make Saturday or Sunday work.
Jess, what are you doing?
I'm making an egg yellows omelet.
The shallots and gouda are going to congeal.
I can't... what is this?
Happy birthday!
It's a party bus.
I'm so excited.
Whoa, Jess, you really did all this for me?
Okay, so...
over here is kosher yogurt and honey.
Kosher yoge?
We got some condoms Over here... small, medium, large, whatever your preference.
Well, I would use...
I don't want to know.
And the R-rated section in the back with the stripper pole.
It's normally used for s*ab, but tonight it's going to be used for $50 worth of seminudity.
Coincidentally, I'm wearing my lap dance pants.
This is, like, your world, huh?
No...
It is.
It's you in your natural habitat, it's fascinating.
I'm just here for Schmidt. I don't know any of these people.
Nicholas, what's up, N-word?
Don't call me "N-word."
I don't know this guy.
How's your family in Chicago?
Really good, thanks for asking, they're all healthy.
That's good.
Oh, look at this big old pile of birthday Schmidt.
Hey, do you mind if I get a ride on your school bus?
I don't want to be late for first period.
Why you got to do me like that, Been-ja-meen?
What's up, boys?
What up?
Why don't you sing us your birthday song?
Oh, you have a birthday song?
All right, all right, guys, come on.
Sing it, come on.
♪ We built this Schmidty ♪
♪ We built this Schmidty ♪
♪ On rock... ♪
♪ On Tootsie Rolls. ♪
Is that the lyrics?
Yeah, we used to make him sing that because he was fat.
You know I'm just playing at you.
Yeah, hilarity, my man, hilarity.
Yeah, come on, man.
You really live with that guy, huh?
Yeah, I really do.
Does he, like, tuck his shiny jeans into boots when he goes out at night?
You know, the truth is, I met Schmidt a long time ago when we were in college and he was this sweet, chubby communications major who wore cargo shorts and...
Yeah.
I'm actually just messing with you.
Seriously, I think all of your friends seem completely awesome and nice and fun, so relax.
You don't have to say that.
-They're my friends, you can tease 'em.
-I don't want to tease them.
I tease them all the time, they don't care.
Schmidt's a d-bag, you know, but, like, not in a bad way, and, like, Jess is a total nut.
Oh...
And Winston is like this competitive maniac who loves Sister, Sister and he's, like, afraid of thunder.
But I'm the voice of re...
Behind you, he's behind you, He's behind you.
Right now he is?
Currently.
And he's also one of my best friends.
Oh, no, keep going.
You want to go on the bus?
Yeah, let's go on the bus.
I'm really sorry, man, I was just saying that to show off for her.
Oh, no, man, I am bringing you down.
Don't bring me down.
Bro juice?
Vodka pom, right?
Winston said it was a tradish.
Look, Benjamin's smiling.
Jess, you did so good.
Is this stripper pole weight-bearing?
Looks like some pretty shoddy workmanship on the cap flange.
Can I help you?
Martin Fuller, GrindPalace.com.
Hi, I'm Jessica Day.
I spoke with your supervisor on the telephone.
Um, are you bringing the stripper?
'Cause I really wanted to see her jugs first, you know, just so... um, I do right by my bro.
We have a little miscommunicado.
Did you make the call?
Because if they hear a woman's voice, then they send me.
I'm your stripper, folks.
Hey, need to clear this aisle.
I got to have a perimeter.
It's a joke... no.
Please, please, please, no, you can't.
Are you the birthday boy?
You are going to love it.
I do wet towel tricks.
Nobody likes wet towel tricks.
No, he does not love wet towel tricks.
I don't judge, pal. I just want to have fun.
We're not... No. Sir, you are not gonna...
I don't want to be rude, but, uh, times are hard.
It is Saturday night, so if I get hired to take my clothes off, I'm gonna get naked.
So, I'll just put my gym bag down, and I'll take my pants off.
No, no, I'll handle it.
Hey.
Hey, Mr. Fuller.
Mr. Fuller.
Mr. Fuller?
Oh, no.
It's getting a little nippy out.
Not a good time to start turtling.
Come on.
Jess, make it stop.
I'm gonna pay you...
$50 to never show us your penis.
But what about tips?
I make my living on tips.
Well, can you do anything else for the money?
I'm a baritone at my gospel choir at First Presbyterian.
Everybody, everybody...
hey!
Welcome to Schmidt's 29th!
Safety is of the utmost importance, so the person sitting next to you is gonna be your bus buddy for the night.
Any time you're up and about, please wear one of these fashion helmets.
And I brought drugs.
Tanya has half a pot cookie, so maybe she'll share.
Okay, everybody, have fun!
Martin, sing us out.
♪ Oh, when he comes ♪

$50. I've never put $50
in the douche bag jar.
Well, that's really impressive, Schmidt, considering.
Someone's personalized condoms just came in the mail.
Hey! Jar! $20.
Winston, did you know that NWA didn't stand for "Never Walk Alone"?
$30. Jar.
Hey, man.
No! Jar, Schmidt.
Jar!
For what?
Somehow, Schmidt, you've outdone yourself this time.
It was my birthday.
I was very drunk.
All right, everybody, I think we need to take sh*ts.
A little bro-juice sh*t for Benjamin!
What?
For Benjamin is a true...
I'm the king!
Winston and Nick, come and get your bro juice!
Bro juice!
Bro juice! Bro juice!
Bro juice?
I have no idea.
Really?
Yeah.
Nick Miller invented bro juice on Schmidt's twenty-second birthday. Remember that?
Bro juice.
Bro juice! Bro juice!
Get over here for your bro juice!
This is not gonna be attractive.
Oh, yeah!
You know, we're way too old for this, don't you? - Oh, definitely.
Happy birthday, brother.
Yeah!
Happy birthday, Schmidty!
Yeah!
Bro juice!
Bro juice!
When I say "Par," you say "Tay."
Par.
Tay!
Par.
Tay!
Holla!
What am I doing?
It makes you think, huh?
Twenties... they're almost over, man. It's crazy.
Are you hitting that?
Jess?
Yeah.
No.
Well, then I think I'll help myself.
To sex... with your friend.
No, no, no, Benjamin, you can't.
Not with Jess. Please don't.
Well, I can. I can, and I will.
Good evening, night owls.
It's about to get bubonic in here, for tonight, we're going to...
The Plague.
Sorry. Just... It's just Plague.
It's a discotheque.
We'll be going there next.
Whose list are you on? Tristan's?
Isn't it just like a bar or something?
What do you pull down a year in the game?
Ever since I started doing full frontal, I pull down seven K a year easy.
Why? You interested in the life?
Me? A male stripper? Come on. You're too kind.
But you know, theoretically, if I were to get into the game, you know, what are they looking for in the gator department?
You know what I mean?
Or is it just moving so fast that it doesn't really matter?
It's all about storytelling, taking 'em on a journey.
Let me ask you some basics.
When you thrust, what's your range of motion, side-to-side?
Well, left... right-right.
What about your testicles?
Are they more or less symmetrical?
Size... yes, location... no.
What about your persona?
What? Fireman or a cop?
I didn't ask you your character.
Your persona.
I'm a Wolf-Hawk. What are you?
Luxury. Dessert.
I'm a warrior poet, man.
That's it.
Got a number for you to call.
You ever hook up with the ladies?
It's ladies, like, one out of ten times at most.
You're dancing for dudes?
Yeah, I'm dancing for dudes.
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
You're so quiet. You're having a terrible time.
I don't mean to be. I'm probably just intimidated.
I'm sitting right next to the inventor of bro juice.
I get it, okay?
That's... I'm gonna brag about that.
I did. I invented bro juice, okay?
And now you want... You're done.
What?!
I get it. When we get off the bus, it's over, I blew it.
It's ridiculous. I don't care about any of it.
I really don't. Everyone's got embarrassing stuff.
I mean, I have stuff that you don't know about.
Like what?
Just don't lie to me about stuff, and we'll be fine.
Fine.
When I work out, which isn't often, Uh-huh.
I listen to Huey Lewis because it pumps me up.
Not ironically. Want to hear something else?
Okay.
I don't believe dinosaurs existed.
I've seen the science. I don't believe it.
Want to hear something else?
No, I think I'm good.
And I believe you, and I appreciate all of this truth-telling.
I don't think you have stuff.
All right.
You're just perfect.
Uh... yeah.
Hey. Scootch.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So, I texted Tristan.
Oh, o-okay.
He said he could get us into Plague.
Oh, that's-that's terrific.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, just you and me, of course.
So why don't you ditch that zero and get with the hero?
The hero is my penis.
Oh. Uh... no.
Am I bad?
No.
Hey, Benjamin.
Just leave her alone.
Schmidt, your party is slugs, bro.
All right, you know what?
Schmidt, this party... is the worst.
No, man.
This party is badass, all right?
Don't act like I didn't see you over there eating on the charcut... the charcut... the charcut?
Charcuterie.
Charcuterie.
Charcuterie. Don't act like I didn't see you eating the charcut...
Charcuterie.
Charcuterie...
Hey, you know what, Curly?
You don't like the bus, then get off it, pal.
Schmidty's birthday, bud.
You guys suck.
Let me talk to him for a sec.
I'm a lawyer.
Please.
She's a lawyer.
Hi. Why don't you just say that one more time?
What? You guys suck?
Look out! Look out!
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh!
Is everyone okay?
Yes. No worries, Jess.
Is everybody okay?
I'm so sorry.
What, are you nuts?
Oh, God.
Who are you?
Whoo!
Tanya, please stop flashing the driver.
What, are you like the Bourne Identity person?
I've got these iss...
like, these anger management issues.
Anger management?
But I'm trying to fix it.
I go to all these class...
They're court-ordered classes, but...
And what was, like, all this stuff you...?
It's martial arts.
I started doing martial arts, ironically, because I thought it would give me a little bit more Zen in my life.
You must be really freaked out right now.
Yes, I am really freaked out.
I'm so sorry.
I hate that I'm so turned on by your craziness, but I, um...
Go with it.
I'm going with it.
You guys sure you're cool waiting for the tow truck?
Yeah, it's fine. I'll see you back at the loft.
Bye, guys. Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Bye, Julia.
Bye, Bro Juice.
Thank you for that.
Bro-J, my man.
So, it's my birthday.
Right now?
Right now.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Schmidt.
I'm 29, folks. What's up?
29!
29!
Can you please not tell anybody I just did that?
That feels embarrassing.
Actually, you know what? I don't care what people think.
Do you think I care too much about what people think, Jess?
Maybe a little bit.
Maybe.
What? Did you have fun tonight?
'Cause I know it was a little bit... flawed.
Jess, are you kidding me?
Tonight was... tens across the board.
No splash.
Good.
No. For real, I had...
Nobody's ever done that for me before.
Any time, Schmidt. Any time.
Schmidt, why are you looking at me like that?
Shh.
'Cause you had... you had fuzz on your face.
No, no, because I thought...
Oh, my God.
You had a piece of fuzz on...
Oh, my God! Jar.
Schmidt!
You had a piece of fuzz, and...
It was a little piece of fuzz.
You tried to kiss her?!
It was right there and just...
Just put it in the jar, Schmidt.
Yeah, come on. No excuses, Schmidt.
Okay. For you... for you guys.
Happy birthday.
29!
Ten more.
Sorry about that.
Ah, Frankie Muniz.
Ooh, Jess, I just found a Groupon for hypnosis lessons.
Think about what you can do with that.
Sex stuff.
Jar.
Look, guys, has anyone seen my good pea coat?
Jar!
Have you seen my sharkskin laptop sleeve? - Jar!
Darn it! Has anyone seen my croquet cleats?
Hey, Jess, have you seen my other timepiece?
Nick, I came up with the best name for an uncircumcised penis.
Bishop in a turtleneck.
Ugh! Jar!
Damn it! I can't find my driving moccasins anywhere.
I can't believe Jess got roller skates for Christmas.
I feel so free.
Don't. See this.
"Merry Christmas, Brendan. Don't swallow these. Love, Uncle Nick."
It's a great gift. He's a 12-year-old kid, it's a bunch of tacks. He's going to love 'em.
Give it to me.
I hate Christmas.
First of all, it means that Hanukkah is over.
Second of all, I hate it when you guys leave and go home.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
I think 4:00 a.m.
Is that it? Schmidt, don't worry about it, man, we're all gonna hang out tonight at your office party.
Please tell me you're not dressing up like Santa this year, are you?
I'm the only man in the office.
Of course I'm gonna dress up like Santa.
Look, I like it.
I get all this dirt on my coworkers.
They get drunk and they whisper what they want for Christmas in my ear, and then I use that information to subtly undermine them and control them for the rest of the year.
Ah, the true spirit of Christmas.
Winston, you'd better watch it, man, because I will take you down.
You want to go? You want to go?
You're gonna take me down? I had figure skating lessons until I was 13, and then my mom sobered up and realized I was a boy. Let's do this.
You should not have said that. Hey, guys, guys, don't fight.
Let's go. You're wearing roller skates.
I'm telling you, man. Both of you, enough, hey, hey.
Nothing's smart about what you guys are doing.
Why don't you both act like grown-ups?
No, no.
I need your help right now.
I need you guys to get in my car and come with me to the mall 'cause I really need to figure out what to buy Paul for...
You guys are all wearing the holiday gifts I gave you.
No, I...
That is so sweet.
I need to take a picture.
Jess, don't take a photo right now.
So cute.
Don't do the photo.
Please, no pictures.
So cute, so cute.
New Girl S01E09
"The 23rd"
==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==
So why can't you figure out what to get your boyfriend Paul?
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause we've only been going out for, like, a month, so I know it's not something fancy.
But do I get him a gag gift or do I get him something sweet?
I don't know.
Well, I think you got to figure out what you feel about him and then get a gift that reflects it.
I think that's kind of the move.
My initial thought was to get him a gift certificate for piping hot sex.
Really... oh, you're being serious?
But I don't want him to think that I'm using him for his body.
I'm sure he'd be okay with that.
"Nerdy weird sex that works for both of us."
Give it back.
This is amazing.
No, come on.
I'm gonna keep this.
I'm gonna cash this in one night and get some weird nerd sex with it. No, but it's not for you.
Oh, my God, thank you.
Now I know what I'm getting my mom.
Oh, my God, Nick. It's going right to my mom.
Why do we have to go to this office party tonight?
Because it's the last night before you guys go home to your families, and we got to blow this thing out, man.
Plus, it'll be a good opportunity for you to do some networking.
Help with the job search.
I'm telling you, everybody's hitting the nog, having a good time, letting loose.
You swoop in there, and then boom... new job, man.
That's how things work.
You know, Benjamins in your pocket, La Pen-si-own, little four-to-the-oh-
to-the-one-to-the-kay.
You're making me want to stay broke.
So what'd you get Paul?
I'm not telling you, but, um, I'll give you a hint.
It's fuzzy.
Well, I hope you didn't listen to Nick.
He's the worst gift giver ever.
You're welcome.
Where are we, Jess?
We are on Candy Cane Lane.
At night, the whole block lights up
with Christmas decorations.
It's so beautiful.
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.
What fun, what wonderful fun.
Okay, whatever.
We have to come back later
'cause you'll see what I'm talking about.
Oh, no, we're not gonna have time.
We have to go straight from the party to the airport.
No.
Yes, I've missed my flight four years in a row.
If I miss it this year, my mom's gonna k*ll me.
Schmidt, it's a menorah for you.
Oh, a menorah.
Judaism, son.
Hey, hi.
You look awesome.
It's a before and after for a Bolivian diet pill.
El Glatrax? Yeah, I've taken that.
I'm "before."
Su-Sure, you are, look at that.
So you said you wanted to see me for something?
Yes, I brought you a gift.
I hope you appreciate that I have kept eye contact with you this whole time and made no reference to the fact that you are basically naked.
Very proud of you, Schmidt.
Hey, hey.
Oh, lot of tongue.
Done with her hair? With her...?
No, I'm not the hair guy, man.
Oh, no, no, no, this is my very good friend Schmidt, and he just came by to bring me a gift, so...
It's perfume.
Why does it say "Cecilia Number 5"?
Actually, it says that because... you know, I ma... I made it specifically for you.
Yeah, I found this place on Third Street where you can design your own perfume.
Base notes of cocoa because of your brown, uh...
ness.
Sea salt, because it kind of sounds like Cece.
Uh, and sandalwood...
Sandalwood... always up to no good.
That's, um...
Ha.
Thank you. Yeah.
Thanks. Neat.
Let's get back to work.
Yeah, okay, um...
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just... I'll see you there.
We'll do that.
Three, two, one.
Go.
Envelope.
Festive bag. I was afraid you were going to get me jewelry, so...
Oh, no.
What is it?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, two tickets to Vienna and passes to the Salzburg Music Festival?
That's, like, incredible.
You're gonna love it.
I'm speechless.
And, um, all I got you was...
"Anatomically correct heart of a 50-year-old nonsmoker."
You know what?
Normally I'm, like, really good at giving gifts, and I thought that was romantic, but it's just... so creepy.
I, I'm sorry, I have to get you something better.
No, it's great, I love it.
It's funny an-and quirky and, and so sweet.
It's like you.
That's why I love it.
I love it.
Thank you, I love it.
I... I love you.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
You're welcome.
Look at you, all dressed up.
What, are you in The Temptations tonight?
That's so cute, Nick, you're intimidated by my style.
But I'll tell you what...
one of us is walking out of here with a job.
Where you going?
You wore my present.
I did.
Thank you, I love it. Yay.
She's seen it now, so maybe you can take it off.
You look like a man.
I know, right? That's what's freaking me out.
Good humor and fun... God forbid.
Is that Schmidt?
Oh.
What the...?
Hey, guys.
Whoa, whoa, Schmidt, Santa voice.
This isn't temple.
Ho, ho, ho.
Are those my shorts?
Hey, what's wrong, Jess?
Hey, Nick.
Paul told me he loved me.
Hmm. And I couldn't say it back, so I, um, said "Thank you,"
which was horrible.
I don't know what to do because I am always the one who loves more.
That's my thing.
One time I went on a date and by 11:00 p.m., I gave the guy my ATM code.
What is your ATM code?
42...
Very funny.
Very good try, but no.
Not a try... I got it.
If you don't have feelings for Paul, you got to tell him.
I can't do that to someone on Christmas.
And then it's New Year's.
Then it's going to be Valentine's Day and then, whoa, it's Presidents' Day.
Hard to argue with that logic, but just tell him.
Don't lead him on... you'll just hurt him more.
Okay.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna tell him.
You are?
Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing in here?
Kyle's being a jerk.
What are you doing in here?
Eating cookies and avoiding confrontation.
Remember when Christmas used to be fun and all I had to do was worry about my drunk uncle asking me out?
Yes, Uncle Pardeep.
He thought I was a boy.
Such a weirdo.
Okay.
Hey, man.
Hey.
How you doing, Paul?
Good.
Has Jess not talked to you?
Oh, yeah, no, we talked.
Yeah, yeah, no, I...
She did, okay.
Yeah, it's hard, you know, it's really tricky. It's like she doesn't love you right now, Paul, but that's not to say she might not fall in love with you later.
I think that's the positive way of looking at it, but it's hard, man, believe me.
We talked about how we might have to drive you to the airport 'cause you're gonna miss your flight.
Yeah, that was probably all you guys talked about, so I'm joking.
W-Wait a minute. Because she hasn't...
Yeah, I know... guess what, Paul.
Don't even think right now.
I'm drunk.
Did... Jess tell you... I'm so drunk.
that she doesn't love me? What's happ...? No, shut up, you goofball.
I'm... this conversation didn't happen.
Did Jess tell you she doesn't love me?
Joke.
But he's the best guy, Cece.
Maybe I should just make it work.
Yeah, no, Jess, you can't just dive into something like this right now.
Yeah, I just wish I could stay in this bathroom all night.
Me, too.
Whoo, that eggnog is deadly.
We got to get out of here.
Yeah, we do.
I should just put it off till later, after the holidays.
You coming?
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.
Kyle wants to go to this party.
Ugh, Kyle is the living worst.
Yeah, I know.
Did he even get you a gift?
No.
Who wants to sit at a desk all day?
Not me... I don't want to have to do that.
I don't want to call Wednesday "hump day."
I don't even know how to network.
So what's your deal, man?
Why are you sitting here by yourself?
Mommy won't let me sit in Santa's lap.
You have a smart mommy.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm the genius who brought my kid to this Christmas party.
Looking forward to years of therapy over Dirty Santa.
I can't believe that he's even talking to you.
He doesn't like anyone.
Yeah, I don't like anyone.
Yeah, but we're really working on that.
No, she's working on that.
My man.
Okay? You think it's fun?
Do it. I do think it's fun.
Do it then.
Do it.
Okay.
What are you doing, Santa?
I have a really bad case of Santa lap.
The entire marketing department is wearing wool.
It's not good down there.
Well, get back to work soon.
Boom! Ow! Why would you...?
There are so many bobby pins up there.
Everything's attached... Does she always talk to you like that?
Yeah, kind of.
You like dressing up like Santa?
Sexy Santa.
No. The truth is, no, I don't.
You know, you don't deserve to be treated like that.
You just got to tell her no.
Otherwise, all she'll do is see you as a pretty face and a hot body.
I'm sorry, what was that?
You have a pretty face.
No, no, no, 'cause the second part.
And I'd like you to say it, like, in an accent, but make direct eye contact. Yes, Schmidt, do not push your luck with me.
What's that smell?
That's your perfume.
You wore it?
Yeah, and it smells terrible.
Ha!
It does smell terrible.
It's like a dirty dish towel.
Santa voice!
Please just tell me what she said.
She said the sex is really great, but she just doesn't want to jump into anything.
Why am I talking about this? Oh, my God, the sex is great, it's amazing.
Great. We had amazing sex this morning, and then we ate Taro chips.
Oh, my God. Oh, oh. Oh, God. I... I feel like such a terrible guy for saying that to you, man.
Oh, my God. You're a good guy, Genzlinger.
Hey, man, just let it go.
You know what I mean? Just let it brush off your shoulders, dude. Oh, man.
What has happened to my life? Hey.
Why are you guys hugging?
Just guy-talkin'. Yeah.
Yeah? Everything's fine.
We're just talking. Just talking.
About, uh... how moved we are... by jazz music.
That's a lie.
I told him you didn't love him, Jess.
What?! Because I...
But he said it nicely.
Are you kidding me?!
It's not your information to share. I totally agree, and I regret it. It is not your information...
Why would you do that?
I apologize.
You guys have a lot to do. I'm sorry. Nick. Nick.
Oh, my God.
Please! This is my nightmare!
Winston!
Schmidt!
Help me...!
Paul, I really care about you.
I think I just... I think I just feel really overwhelmed.
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Nicholas told m...
Damn it.
Hey, guys, just pretend I'm not here, and just do whatever you two guys are doing.
I'm not here. I'm not even listening.
This is my nightmare.
I-I knew you were getting out of a long relationship.
You told me all about Spencer. I just thought...
I thought we were feeling the same things for each other.
You seemed like you were.
I was. I just...
I feel like maybe you were feeling them a little bit more than me.
Nick!
You started this.
Sit down and be quiet!
I just... I got really hurt, and I... I'm trying really hard not to get hurt again.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh.
Oh...
I am so sorry.
This is as rude as it gets.
It is my mom, though.
I... Hey, Ma. How you doing?
I can't talk right now.
I'm in a real weird situation.
No, Ma, I'm not high... I'm done with that phase.
I promise you I won't miss my flight.
Okay. I love you, Mama. Bye.
You done?
Can we just...
can we just keep going but take it a little bit slow?
I-I don't know if I can do that.
I don't know how with you.
It's just not how I feel. Well, all she's asking you to do is slow it down a little bit.
How's that hard?
Nick.
Yeah.
All right, everybody leave the room.
I need to talk to Kim.
Okay, you know what? Actually, stay... this'll be good for you guys to hear this, too.
Why d... Don't...
Come on.
I just told... There are two hours left in this party.
What are you doing, Santa?
Kim, I'm not gonna be Sexy Santa anymore.
It's over. Santa's d*ad.
I k*lled him.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, don't worry, that's just Gina's cowardly son.
He is a scream machine.
Kim, I'm not a sex object, all right?
I'm your employee.
And I work harder than anyone.
I'm the first one to show up every morning.
No, you're not.
There's never a parking space.
That's because everyone's already here, Nick.
Okay, you're so off topic right now.
You're missing the point. What?
You need to take me seriously, Kim.
Does that mean no more...
Sexy Easter Bunny?
No Sexy Easter Bunny.
What about, uh, Cinco de Sexy?
No Cinco de Sexy.
And no Sexy Martin Luther King?
I could never get the voice, I never really felt like I had the authority...
I can't believe it took you five years to say that.
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to be Sexy Santa next year.
Yeah, just got to jingle bell rock.
You know what I mean?
That is so inappropriate.
I get it... so you can dish it out but you can't take it.
Yeah, how's that feel, Kim?
I like it.
Both these machines need toner.
They need... I'm gonna put the toner in the...
in the machine.
Mrs. Miller, I told you, I will get Nick to his flight on time.
No worries.
I can't find Elvin. I've looked everywhere.
I-I have no idea. Uh, you know what?
I got to go. Um, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
We'll find him.
Elvin!
I'll tell you what, you go that way, I'll go that way.
This is Schmidt's fault. I don't know how, but it is.
Elvin?
I'm sorry, Jess, I just...
I don't want to slow down... with you.
It's just not natural. So if you need to, then... I don't think I can do this anymore.
Okay.
Come on, Paul!
It's Christmas!
Don't break up with her... Hey, Nick...
It's okay.
Hey, have you guys seen a little kid running around here?
Thank you.
Ah. I see you found Santa's house.
I was looking for it.
The man with no shirt k*lled Santa.
Oh, you mean Schmidt.
Well, he was just dressing up like Santa.
Then why didn't he have a shirt?
You know, we ask ourselves that question every single day.
Is it because he's a D-bag? Mommy says he's a D-bag.
You know something?
You're a really smart kid.
And for that, Santa's gonna bring you extra presents this year.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you, LeBron.
Okay, cool, I'll be him.
You found him!
Yeah. Hi!
Extra gifts this year.
You're really good at this. Seriously.
If you ever want to hang out with Elvin again...
I will pay you a lot of money.
Let's go.
A lot.
Thank you.
Like, whatever you're thinking, add money to that...
'cause that's what I...
Like, a lot.
Bye, Elvin.
Bye, LeBron.
Yep.
What up, Mrs. Miller?
Yes, yes. Actually, we're on our way right now, so just go back to sleep.
We're getting Nick to the airport, okay?
What kind of airline has flights that
Actually, what's that smell?
It's nothing. Oh. That's my perfume.
Oh, God, that is bad.
But the weird kind of bad that makes you want to smell it again.
Okay, there's something that we got to do. Sorry.
What are you doing, man!
Hold on, you're going in the wrong direction!
I think we're too late, Nick.
Yeah, this was supposed to be your gift, Jess.
I screwed it up.
I'm sorry.
Candy Cane Lane is shut down!
Should've got her perfume, man.
Nice, man.
Man.
Yeah.
I have the worst timing.
I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Let's go.
We should go. No, we don't...
Jess, no.
It's Christmas. It's our Christmas.
We came here to see the lights.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Yeah, what are you doing? What are you doing?
It's 2:00 a.m. Why would they turn them off?
It doesn't make sense to me. Nick!
We don't got time for this.
Excuse me, guys?
Oh, hell, no!
Excuse me, we got a girl out here who'd really like to see the lights!
Sorry to wake you! This is rude!
Make it the Candy Cane Lane or whatever!
You spend all this time to show off and do it, so show off... you got an audience!
This whole neighborhood is ridiculous!
You all show off, so turn on the lights!
Just go in the shed or whatever and turn your damn lights on, you show-offs!
Turn on your lights! Turn on the lights!
Turn on your lights!
Lights! Turn on your lights!
Turn on your lights! Turn on your lights!
Turn on your lights!
Yes! Yes!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Hanukkah!
Now, stop yelling before I call the cops!
Oh, my God.
Candy Cane Lane is the crème de la crme It is... amazing. of decorated streets.
Hey, Ma! How are you?
Yeah. No, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Yeah, I'm sorry. No.
Ma, stop yelling at me, please stop yelling.
Ma, I'm not high! Stop yelling!
I'm driving a car. I can't talk.
Hey, remember Winston?
Winston, it's my ma. Talk to her.
Hey, what up, Mrs. Miller?
You know, I wrote a poem about you.
You want to hear it?

Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

Don't worry about it. I'm good.
I'm more than good.

Can you not do this to yourself?
Look at your hair, you look ridiculous.
What am I supposed to talk about for an hour?
It's a haircut.
No, you're trapped.
You can't move, and they're standing behind you with their hands in your hair, and they expect you to talk back.
Oh, yeah, it's your baby.
He's cute.
Yeah, your baby's cute.
Okay, I tell you what, man, just come to my place.
No, I'm not going to a black barbershop, Winston.
I've seen the movies;
I know how fast they talk.
I don't need to seem any less cool than I already do.
Want to go to my salon?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
So, um...
heads up, Paul's coming tonight.
And I just wanted to tell you that I'm gonna tap him like a maple tree.
I'm gonna be searching for some syrups.
I'm gonna be having sex with him.
All right.
All right, hey!
Why are you telling us this?
'Cause I want to. I want to give you a heads up.
You nervous? You need tips?
No, I'm not nervous.
Just, you know, I can drive stick.
(chuckles)
Yeah, 'cause it seems like you're freaking out a little bit.
With this whole activity.
That's not stick, that's a*t*matic.
That's not a*t*matic.
Another bathroom break, Schmidt?
You know, I've been timing you all day.
Seven minutes and 23 seconds.
I wonder what was going on in there.
Hmm? You pooped.
Can you stop timing me, please?
It's ridiculous that you do that.
I will break you.
Hey, Lisa!
You were on f*re last night, girl!
I'm taking her job.
What did you do last night?
Everyone from the office went to Jill's bachelorette party.
Why don't I get invited places?
Is it because I'm the only man in the office?
"Man." That's adorable.
How is it...
You know, Sarah got promoted.
Sarah?
With the, with the gums?
Yeah.
So she's out of the...
That corner cubicle is free.
(sighs)
So much kick-back space.
And, you know, Gina personally invited me to her baby shower tonight.
So that corner cubicle ... that's all mine.
You like a Bond villain?
You just told me your whole plan.
(chuckles)
(British accent): Mr. Darcy's going to love my new bonnet.
Why are we here?
You don't understand.
You've never been cheated on before.
Spencer and I never tried anything new, and maybe if I'd been... more erotic...
Spencer cheated on you because he's a total jerk, not 'cause you're bad in bed.
It's been six years.
Everything I know about sex, I learned from Spencer or the Clinton impeachment trial.
MAN:
He used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the Oval Office area...
WOMAN: Jess!
Mom?!
I'm not listening to NPR.
(whistles)
No. No whistle.
It's terrible!
Uh, excusez-moi.
Can I try this on, please?
Oh, the starfish. You can't try that on.
Health code.
I'll take it!
Ha!
I hope Paul's packing some coral polyps,
'cause this starfish is hungry.
(chuckles)
Starfish eat coral polyps.
Just pay, Jess.
So today I'm gonna show you how to cut your own hair.
Uh, I consider myself...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing, Nick?
It's a haircut! Human interaction.
You're a bartender, you talk to strangers every single day.
I don't like when they touch my head, Winston.
I don't like it.
Go to the damn salon!
No, it's fine, okay?
I'm learning how to do it myself.
I'm learning from this video.
(screaming)
Oh!
Oh, my God, man!
(screaming)
I was wondering why it had so many views.
Let's watch it again.
Hey.
(chuckles) What?
You know, Gina, I was just walking by and, I mean, I was literally pulled in here by the glow.
What do you want, Schmidt?
I was just working my tail off at my cubicle, which, between you and me, is surrounded by a couple of chatty Cathys.
I mean, that's really their names.
It's Cathy S. and Cathy G.
Anyway, they won't shut up about a baby shower tonight for a certain VP VP.
"Very pregnant vice presidente."
You're the worst. Seriously, the worst.
Get out.
Gina, honestly, it would mean so much to me if you would just let me come to your baby shower.
Okay, fine. Come to my baby shower.
I can come? - Yeah.
So I'm invited?
Yeah, you're invited.
All right.
I saw your registry.
I'm gonna get you one of those portable baby pumps.
You're just out there in every day life, but you're pumping yourself at the same time, you know.
Just milking away. Just...
(makes sh**ting noises)
Get out.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Why don't we meet here at 8:00?
PAUL:
Great. Okay.
Uh, where's the place?
Um, I think it's in Koreatown.
Let me check.
Ooh, exotic.
(sighs)
Let me see here.

PAUL:
Jess?
What?
Oh, um...
Sorry, uh...
Can I call you back?
Yeah.

(key clicks, video stops)
Hey, Schmidt!
Can I borrow your computer?
Nick? Winston?

(woman shrieks, man chuckles)
What?
(man laughs, whip cracks)
Hey, do you have my comput...
Oh, my computer.
I have your computer.
I can see that.
Hey, I got to cram for this baby shower.
Can I, can I have it back?
I've been watching p*rn.
You...
(chuckles)
I found your red folder.
How-how long you been doing that for? Are you okay?
Five and a half hours.
(horse neighs)
Wow. Uh, you went deep, Jess.
Real deep.
Help me, guys.
I have 15 minutes.
Teach me how to be good at sex.
I just, I have to go on this date right now and I can't do it. I'm freaking out, okay?
I need all of you to sit in front of me and tell me what guys like in bed, right now.
What do you want to know?
Okay.
Um, when you're...
if you're in the...
if you're holding the...
Start over.
Um...
when you reach...completion...
Yeah, that was it.
Completion?
No! No, wait.
I can't do this, Jess.
Come on. Come back here.
Jess, guys want to be whisked away.
They want to be enchanted.
Just take your clothes off, Jess.
Do you think that Paul watches stuff like that?
All the time.
For sure.
Probably watching it right now.
Really? Okay.
I put this on mute, because this girl's...
like, pretty loud.
And, um, my main thing that I took away was, gosh, that young lady can really multitask.
Super normal.
She's a pro.
What she's doing.
I don't know if every girl's like that, but she's a pro.
Was wondering if there are any trendy moves.
'Cause I've been doing the same four for the last six years, like...
Uh, and you know, like, uh...
(groans)
That one.
And I don't know.
Do you think that Paul would be into, like, something like that?
What, a little light choking?
I'm gonna bet Paul is into some pretty dark stuff.
Light choking, really?
No one's doing that.
You know what, Nick, maybe you're hooking up with the wrong kind of girl.
Apparently, I'm hooking up with the right girl, Schmidt, because they don't choke me.
Nick is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
Winston and I...
Don't want to be a part of this.
...we're sushi.
So you guys really think you're better at sex than me.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
What did you do after you lost your virginity? What did you say to me?
Don't say that right now. You're taking it out of context.
He said, "Winston, is it okay that I didn't get my pants all the way off?"
That's a true story. That really happened.
I was 16 years old.
And I've gotten a lot better.
You haven't gotten that much better. I used to listen to you and Caroline all the time in college.
It was like listening to a rescue crew trying to communicate with a stranded miner.
"Are you okay?"
"Yeah. Are you okay?"
"Yeah."
Hey, guys, I don't have much time.
Can we get this back on track?
I need to know what to do.
Would flicking be, like, a cool thing?
No.
No!
Absolutely not.
How about role play?
Do you know any voices?
Yes. I can do an old-timey newscaster, like, "Hey there, son, I'm gonna kick you into next Tuesday, see?"
You're telling me, for the last 15 years, you've been thinking I'm bad at sex. I'm fantastic at sex.
Dude, you're scared to get a haircut.
Yeah, I don't like getting a haircut!
It's too intimate. What does that have to do with sex?
Okay, Jess, here's what you're gonna do.
You got a question, just come to me because I'm obviously the best.
No, you're not the best.
Jess, who do you think, of the three of us, is the best at sex?
Yes.
And take emotion out of it.
No one's feelings are gonna get hurt.
Go with your gut. - Especially, you know, Nick and Winston's.
No, I'm not doing this.
Say a name.
Go with your gut.
(knock on door)
Oh. Oh!
Hey! Paul!
Hey, Paul.
Hey.
PAUL: Hey.
Hey, goose.

JESS: I'm gonna go get ready in my room.
Okay.
I'll be back.
I'll just hang out with the guys.
Cool.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up, Paul?
Oh, you're looking at me like, "what?"
I should tell you.
Um, "Goose" is short for
"me gusta Jess."
Of course.
Come here, sit down, man.
Thank you. - I am so tired of people being so careful with me.
It's like, I am 40
and I am pregnant.
I am not made out of crackers.
(laughing) (laughs)
Hey, ladies What are you guys talking about?
Afterbirth.
Afterbirth.
That's like the, the party you guys have after you have the baby...
Sort of. - You know, I'd like to be invited to that.
You know what they say,
"An afterbirth ain't an afterbirth without some Schmidt up I in there."
Schmidt? Come here.
I'm gonna talk to you in a little bit.
What are you doing?
I'm rocking this party, Beth.
Watch this.
Hi. How's everyboby doing?
You know, I just, I just wanted to take a moment to, well, to say how honored I am to celebrate the journey of Bogart through Gina, and out and into the light.
Here's to elective C-sections!

You don't know the first thing about women.
Ah, you're the best, Beth. I don't know if you know this about me, but I was in two frats in college.

Just relax, and be yourself.
You're awesome.

Why are you asking Winston?
Because, Nick, look at your hair.
You really don't look like someone who's good at sex.
I can't believe you just said that.
Here's what you do. You're gonna stop worrying about it.
Completely.
Yeah. That's really good.

No, I'm so sorry.
No, no, don't, please...
Unacceptable.
I'm really intimidated by you, Jess.
You're so experienced, and I've never done any of that stuff, that S and M style... bondage stuff.
It scares me a little, but I...
want to do it, because I know that you're into it.
Just please be gentle with me at first, okay?
I really like you.
Really?
Yeah, I do.
And nothing else matters.

Except, just...
no f*re, and no handcuffs, please. Please, please, please.

Wait. Um...
Last night was kind of a... low point for me. I mean...
I'm not really into that stuff. I just... I thought that whatever I used to do wouldn't be good enough, or sexy enough, or advanced enough, and that's why I did that...
Oh no!
Sorry. - Oh, no. No, it's okay, it just surprised me a little bit.

I'm so sorry, you guys, I should have told you, but the community center decided to turn our rehearsal space back into a hallway, so...
I had nowhere to go.
Is this something that a mean, creative judge made you do?
NICK: Yeah, this is just like a nightmare I had where you brought over teenagers with bells.
JESS:
These kids had a choice between early morning detention and music, and they all chose music.
No kidding?
Desiree, bells are not for hitting.
The kids wanted to play band instruments, but we got a huge donation of handbells, which are tres tres dope.
DESIREE: Miss Day, can I eat some of these crackers up in here?

No, no, no. Water crackers are for adults... to eat with adult cheese.
Can I eat a cr*cker sushi sandwich?
No. Jess.
WINSTON: So what, you guys are gonna sit around all night playing "Jingle Bells"?
"Jingle Bells" is a trash song played on a trash instrument, and I'm not really asking permission, I'm giving you a heads-up.

I know handbells aren't the coolest instrument in the world, they might not even be the fifth coolest, but the kids would love it, it would really mean a lot to them, and if they saw how good you are, I think they'd really get into it and maybe try a little bit harder.

Okay, you know what, I think they did a pretty great job, considering the fact that they've only played it, like, eight times.
Well you're wrong, okay You thought wrong, Jess.
You know why? Because I'm out here right now by myself in the cold.
I got no support.
Maybe we're just not good enough.
No, you are good enough.
This is not your problem, this is Mr. Bishop's problem.

Mr. Bishop...
I'll tell you what.
Here. Here.
You're gonna play these, okay?
Play these until you figure it out.
Right? Don't play these.
(laughs)
And what are you laughing at, WNBA?
This is what you look like.
(mumbling nonsensically)
You look like you're fighting off a shark.
Okay, this is what I want.
Mr. Bishop!
Petting a dolphin.
Oh, yeah, there we go.
All right, and you...
You didn't make me want to throw up.
Really?
Now, come on, people!
Out!
What?
Get out. You're out of the group. You're being mean.
Fine. I don't need this.
I warned y'all about these bells.
Told you, told you, told you.
I'm gonna make you guys a pitcher of my famous virgin Sangria.
Isn't that just juice?
(screams)
This has to stop!
It's not my w*r!
(door opens, closes)
Hey, uh, maybe Jess is right.
Maybe we should talk this thing through.
Absolutely, man.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right, I'm gonna put a clean shirt on.
Great, man.
What is that, man?
I'm sorry. I put your couch and your freezer in your room, Schmidt.
Yeah, I didn't want to get my poor on them.
I got to get in there, man. I'm a mess.
I have to go to a networking event later.
Scott Caan is speaking!
Ugh, would you listen to yourself?
Did you use my conditioner?
What? No.
No, I can tell, man.
What are you doing?
(sniffing)
Lotusberry Relax. Lotusberry Relax.
I can smell it on you right now!
Fine! Stop smelling my hair!
You know how much that stuff costs?
Okay, Schmidt, I didn't use your conditioner.
Why does your hair look so baby soft?!
Fine, Schmidt!
I ran out of shampoo and I used your conditioner.
We're talking about conditioner, right?
You used it as shampoo?!
It's for moisture, Nick, not for cleaning!
I can't believe we're friends. Give me it back, man.
Give you what back?
Give me it back.
Think about what you're doing right now.
I'm squeezing it out of your hair.
You're squeezing it out of my hair?
Yes, I am.
Stop squeezing it out of my hair!
Okay, yeah.
It's on.
It's on. It's happening.
Oh, it is?
Yeah, it is happening.
Oh, you want ...
Okay, it is.
These are the first moments of what is happening right now.
This is the beginning of what's happening right now!
Want to get your hands dirty?
Yeah, man.
Whoa!
Come on, Schmidt!
You little rich boy sissy!
Come on! Who you gonna hire to fight me, boy?!
Stop running!
Stop running, Schmidt!
You want it so bad, you got it!
Okay!
Enough!
Where is this coming from, man?
Look, you chose to be a bartender.
You chose to drop out of law school.
You're not some down-on-your-luck hardscrabble guy, you're just a loser who...
I didn't mean...
It's fine, man.
Okay.
(sighs)
Whatever, whatever, whatever, man.
(chuckles)
(sighs)
Just, these are the things that come out, man, when you take another man's conditioner.
Winston, we need to talk.
We had a dress rehearsal.
It was horrible.
(kids clamoring, screaming)
Stop it!
Hey!
(bells ringing)
Those are expensive!
Hector! Hector!
(screaming wildly)
I'm sorry, Jess, but I really don't care.
You know what, I love running this group.
It gives me confidence, it gives me muscle definition.
Yes, sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines where I literally can't see three feet in front of myself.
But I love these kids.
And I'm sorry I kicked you out of group, but one thing you can't do with these kids is make it about you.
Jess, I don't see what the big deal is, okay?
I only practiced with you guys a couple of times.
You're such a tonkel!
Whoa, hold it!
Don't nobody call me a tonkel.
If you tell them they aren't good, that's one more person telling them that.
That's a big deal to me, making sure no one else gives up on them.
Even if they sound like a guy covered in bells falling down a staircase that's also made of bells.
I know you've had a hard month, I know you don't have a job, but, God, they're just kids.
Also, what happened to the refrigerator and the sofa?
Did we get robbed by giants?
You know what sucks about getting older?
Your friends have known you for way too long.
They've got too much on you.
Yep.
I want friends who still lie to me,
'cause they don't want to hurt my feelings.
Mm.
I sadly kind of mean that.
What happened to us, man?
We used to be so cool.
I was going to play basketball and be a gazillionaire.
(chuckles):
Right. And I told myself I was never going to live with Schmidt.
Who do you live with now?
I live with Schmidt, and he's k*lling me, Winston, he's k*lling me.
(laughs)
(sighs)
I got fired from a temp job.
(chuckles)
Yeah, I got kicked out of bell group for being too mean to kids.
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
That's a low point. You ain't got to talk to me, I know it.
(laughs)
I know it, man.
But I was just enjoying being good at something.
Yeah.
I mean, what does she want me to do, not care about what the songs sound like?
Winston, this is your thing though.
It's not always about being the best.
It's not always about you, Winston.
This is about kids.
Just pass the ball.
(chuckles)
(sighs)
("Eye of the Tiger"

I'll drive, pal.
Hey.
Want to go to this bells concert?
Let me get my cardigan.
JESS:
I know you guys are nervous.
I know you want to do a really great job and you want to sound really great, but it's not about that.
There's a really big crowd of people who's really excited and wants to hear some bells today.
Just look.
All right, bring it in.
(grunting)
JESS:
Hello, Pershing Park!
We are...
ALL:
Ensembell.
MAN:
What? What'd you say?
I said, um, Ensembell.
She said Ensembell!
It's on the banner, stupid!
MAN: You guys gonna play something?
(chuckles)
But first, I'd like to welcome Winston Bishop to the stage.
WOMAN:
Hey, what's a Winston Bishop?
(grunts)
Hey.
(chuckles)
What's up?
"Eye the Tiger"?
Yo, Hector, you think we can pull this off?
Probably not.
Yeah, I don't think so, either.
So let's do it.
One, two, three, four.
(playing "Eye of the Tiger")
Two, three, four.
You know I don't think you're a loser, right?
I can't hear anything you say when you wear that sweater, Schmidt.
You open your mouth and I just hear: "Cardigan, cardigan.
I am wearing a cardigan."
SCHMIDT:
This is super embarrassing.
NICK:
Yeah, it's terrible.

Hi.
Thank you so much for helping backstage. This year.
Really, it's made such a difference.
That's nice.
Yeah.
How... how is your boyfriend?
We broke up.
Oh, sorry.
Good riddance! Just kidding.
Oh.
What are you doing for Thanksgiving?
Well, I always spend it with my grandmother...
That's so nice.
But she just d*ed.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
That's terrible. When?
Well, it was about a month ago.
It was while I was writing the Halloween madrigal.

What is that?
I went to five grocery stores, and I got the last turkey in America.
No, Jess, we're not doing Thanksgiving, okay?
We talked about this.
We're just gonna watch football, drink beer and then we are going to Best Buy for Black Friday.
Or as I like to call it, "Friday."
It's our thing, Jess. It's Dudesgiving.
Okay, no matter how many e-mails you send, that's not a thing.
It's real, man. It's totally real.
It's not real.
We're not calling it that.
It has been two years since I've had an American Thanksgiving.
We talked about this.
Look, it's not a big deal.
I'm just cooking dinner for you guys... and Paul.
What?
What?
Hmm? What?
Did you say "and Paul"?
Who's Paul?
Did you invite somebody named Paul to our house?
Yes, I did. I asked someone out.
Asked someone out?
Jess, be honest ... is the turkey named Paul?
It's a real guy.
And he teaches at my school.
And he's really, really hot!
And the turkey is named Hank ... Hanksgiving.
And we are gonna eat him, so...

Are we gonna be able to hang out with Paul or is he also a teacher?
No, he's a total guy's guy.
He normally spends Thanksgiving with his nana, but she just passed away.
That's a great plan, Jess, be the girl who replaces his d*ad nana.
I know!
Guys, look, this is a bad idea.
He's gonna be our fifth roommate, I'm telling you.
It's a first date.
We don't know him, okay? We got to figure out whether or not he's the right guy for us.
We deserve to be happy.
You guys, don't even get up.
Just enjoy your beers. It's gonna be a great meal.
Just curious, does anybody know anything about cooking?
Mm-mmm.
No pressure.
Just, like, cooking a turkey, for example.
It says you need some kind of string.
Trussing string.
Don't, Schmidt!
That's a good turkey tip. You got more?
Here's a tip: Don't cook Thanksgiving dinner for five people in 14 hours.
Here's another tip: don't ask a guy out on a first date on the least sexy holiday in America.
What are the most sexy holidays?
The most sexy holidays are Fourth of July, uh, Independence Day, obviously, Women's History Month and Christmas.
Will you help me?
No, definitely not.
What if I invite Cece?
Don't do it, Schmidt. Beer, football, Black Friday.
Thanksgiving with Cece.
No, Schmidt.
Okay.
No, no, no, no!
No, Schmidt!
But I want to let you know up front that I've got some control issues in the kitchen, so I'm gonna do this, I'm cooking the whole meal.
I don't want you touching anything.
And I don't want to hear,
"Schmidt, Schmidt, you're using too much tarragon,"
because I'm not.
You will never hear that from me.
I'm in.
Come on, Schmidt!
Yes!
So, this guy's gonna thaw out by tomorrow, right?
What are we, scientists?
Oh!
Hey, look at that, it's ready.
What am I gonna do?! He comes in three hours!
Oh, God, I can't get it in!
We've all been here, am I right?
Jar.
Maybe if I take off all my clothes and I get in bed with him, the heat of my body will warm it up.
I'm not gonna lie. This is turning me on a little bit. - It is?
Hey, guys.
Cece! Thank God. Come down here and lie on the turkey with me.
Oh, hell, yeah, do that.
Yeah, do it. That'd be good.
This is a terrible idea.
Yeah, 100%.
I put it on permanent press.
Good, so you don't have to iron it.
(knocking)
No! He's here early! How do I look?
It's better if you don't know.

It's good to see you.
Um...
So, I'm just gonna freshen up.
Oh, thanks.
And I'll be right back.
I forgot to tell you, Paul brought his violin, and with a little coaxing, he fiddle with the old horsehairs.
Only if you don't mind being enchanted.
(both laugh)
I just want to watch the game.
Hey, Nick, can I talk to you?
I just need you not to do that thing that you do.
What thing? I don't do a thing.
Yes, you get all mean and you make that little turtle face.
Okay, I don't think I make a turtle face.
Just talk to him like a normal human being.
Not about politics or small business loans or the Google conspiracy thing, okay?
I've only seen him at school, and I really want to wow him tonight, okay?
Please, he's the only guy I've liked since Spencer.
I'm not good at this stuff, so please just help me.
All right, fine, I'll help you.

I don't want to do it like that, though.

Hmm.
It's a teacher joke, sorry.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, Paul.
Um, just so I get to know you a little better and you can know me better, Yeah.
We're gonna play a little game.
Oh, great. Fun, yeah.
All right, I'm gonna say something, and you're gonna say the first thing that pops in your head.
Kazoo.
Okay, we haven't even started yet.
Okay. I'm gonna stick with kazoo.
Right, okay, um,
"boundaries."
Important.
Okay, um,
"other people's stuff."
Private.
Good. Uh, "loud early morning sex."
Nice work if you can get some.
(toots)
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Nicholas.
What's going on, guys? Nicholas, wow.
Just two dudes playing word-association games, kicking back a couple of pumpkin ales.
I think that's a lager, right?
Mm-mm, this is an ale. It has to do with the fermentation process.
Could be, could be.
Uh, hey, do you want to watch football, the Lions?
Ah, yes! The mighty, mighty Lions of Des Moines.
They play every Thanksgiving, right, because they're the most ferocious of the teams.
Lions from Detroit. Detroit Lions.
That's another...
What you gobbling about, turkeys?
(both laugh)
Anyone who tells you the future of gravy is nitrogen-based is cooking with blinders on, Cece.
What is...? Are you...? Did you wash your hands?
I'll wash them after.
Okay, no.
See, just, can you just stop?
Because now the entire bowl of walnuts is compromised.
Wow. You're very sanitary.
Do you wash your hands ten times a day?
Okay, look, don't worry, Cece.
If I need to, I can get my hands dirty.
I mean, I get dirty all over.
Would you eat this filthy walnut?
Yeah, I mean, I'd eat the... yeah.
Okay, open your mouth. Open your mouth, Schmidt.
No!
(water runs)
Beautiful savage.
Oh, intermission.
No, it's halftime.
It's parade time.
It's robot turkey.
You know, it was Grandma's favorite.
We used to love watching the parade together.
She was the best.
Check it out. Here she is.
Here's the lady.
Oh, she's beautiful!
Yeah. We used to get in the funniest arm-wrestling matches.
(chuckles)
Hey, can I show you something?
Uh, picture here. That's my grandpa.
Aw...
d*ed last year.
I'm so sorry. Sorry, Winston.
Thanks. Thanks, man. It's okay.
This picture right here was when he tried to quit drinking. That was a bad idea for everybody.
This is the first time he tried gelatto.
He did not like that.
What was his name?
His name was Nelson.
Hey, Schmidt, how's it going?
Well, I need some walnuts. I have no walnuts.
I should go get those. You should stay here with the turkey.
Though, sh**t. I have had two pumpkin ales.
I probably shouldn't get behind the wheel of a car.
Nick, how many pumpkin ales have you had?
Oh, I've had zero pumpkin ale.
Then can you take Paul to the store, right?
(softly): ♪ Getting some walnuts, getting some walnuts. ♪
I'm sorry, man, are you singing about what we're doing?
Yeah, guess I was.
Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it.
Where are you from?
Chicago.
Oh, land of plenty.
It's weird being in L.A.
It doesn't feel like Thanksgiving.
It feels like there should be, like, a little nip in the air, you know?
A little bit like...
Yeah, totally.
...an autumn crisp.
So, Jess said you're a lawyer, right?
I dropped out of law school. I had three semesters to go.
Oh, what?! So close!
So you're still trying to figure it out, right?
That's what your 20s are for.
I'm 30, so...
Oh, Mr. Copycat.
(chuckles)
That's where I get my copies made.
No way! Yep!
You get your copies there?!
I don't, I don't. It was the other one.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me, man. - No.
That's right.
I need long sustained mashes.
Oh, hey, you've got something on your nose right...
What?! What?!
No!
What is wrong with you?
Look at this recipe. Look at the recipe.
Where in this recipe does it say "put mashed potatoes on Schmidt's nose"?
Look at it. No. Here? Here? Here?
Go on, show me!
Schmidt!
Oh, hey. Hey.
NICK: Look, Paul, move.
We got the nuts, Jess.
I don't think Nick likes me very much.
No.
(loud bang)
(hissing)
Turkey!
Turkey's on f*re! f*re!
Jar.
It's like a Prince video.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I really wanted you to have a good time.
Remember when it was only dudes living here, and we had no fires?
This is ridiculous.
Three months ago we didn't even know this girl.
My Lasik'd eye is freaking out.
Okay, that's it. We're leaving. Guys, let's get out of here.
I've had a great time.
Paul, I am so sorry.
We're going to the bar. We can't get rid of the smoke.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on, we can still do this. What are you guys doing?
I have been dying to try that food you've been cooking all day.
You've been slaving away in there.
What's your name again?
Schmidt.
Right.
You know, it's my last name.
Well, my last name is Genzlinger, and I'd like to eat the food that you've been making all day, Schmidt.
Yeah, all right. Genzlinger.
I'm with Genzlinger.
JESS: I have an idea!
Let's go next door.
Mrs. Beverly's really great. She's visiting her sister, but she gave me her spare key for emergencies.
So we're breaking and entering. That's a felony, FYI.
Hey, law school! Nice!
JESS:
No, we're not breaking in.
I gave her a key to our place, too.
She sometimes has a problem with her shower.
No, not you.
What are you doing? You promised me you'd be nice to him.
I was nice to him! I've been very nice to Paul.
NICK: The whole car ride over I was nice to him.
You know what he tells me about?
He likes Air Bud 2.
He loves dogs. I know where he gets his copies made. He likes to whistle.
He wanted to open the door with me, so when my hand went up, so did his.
Oh, I get it.
He's not cool enough for you.
'Cause nobody can be cool enough for cool Nick Miller.
I'm Nick Miller.
I'm so cool, I'll make my cool face.
Why don't you like him?
NICK:
Who cares? Do you like him?
JESS:
Of course I like him.
Okay, fine! It doesn't matter what I think, does it?
'Cause I don't have to have sex with him.
I do. I want to.
I want to have sex with him big-time.
NICK: Great.
JESS: You heard me!
Big-time! Okay?
I want to take him down to Chinatown and slice him off a piece of this pumpkin pie, okay?
What is pumpkin pie?
JESS: I want to do all the things that you do in a bedroom, with him, okay?
I want to do it standing up and sitting down, and half-up and half-down, and the wiggly one, and the Bear att*ck, and the claws in the head, and the one the figure skaters do, and the What's For Lunch, and the... Give Me That Hat. Let's just say that I'm good. I'm really, really good.
And I don't care what you think!
Then why did you ask me?
Hey, Jess.
Uh... just want you to know everyone really loves Paul.
And also, we can hear everything you're saying.
What?
Play through.
After you, Jess.
Excuse me.
So, um... just a heads-up.
Uh... we're just rehearsing a play that, uh, Nick is writing. It's called...
"Big-Time."
It's... it's about a man who, um, loves another man named Paul and it's not very good.
I'm so sorry.
I've done Give Me That Hat.
Only for me it was like, I, you know, I was like, I was like, "Here, take my hat."
Do you know what I mean?
(plucking strings)
So how bad was it, on a scale from one to bad?
Let's put it this way:
a normal guy would've left a long time ago and he's still here, right?
He's not normal.
Schmidt yelled at me earlier.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did he get weird? He's weird about cooking.
Did you touch his whisk?
CECE:
No, the thing is, Jess...
is I think I'm into him.
What? Oh, God.
Yeah, he's got this rage inside of him, this fury, and I just love it.
NICK: Hey, Schmidt?
It's hour nine. I'm starving.
Well, I can blanch or I can talk, but I can't do both.
I'm going in.
(violin string twangs)
Nick...
I gotta just say something to you.
I feel like... you think I'm kind of annoying.
You didn't have to come here to say that.
You could've done it from over there. - Okay.
And if that's the case ... which I don't know that it is ...
It is.
I don't care.
I actually feel sort of sorry for you, because at this point in your life I know that you'll never dislike me more than you dislike yourself.
Really? That's what you're going with, Violin?
Want a little, um, napkin-folding music?
(laughs)
Kind of need it.
I can't believe you're still here.
What do you mean? Of course I'm still here.
Why wouldn't I be here?
Hey.
Let's talk about what happened earlier.
'Cause you made me feel like I was a really bad girl.
I know I did, and...
I'm really sorry, Cece.
I'll never yell at you like that again.
How about now?
Please... Please don't do that.
Got my dirty little hands in your pudding. - Can you...
So gross...
It's so gross, please... Oh, God.
Mmm...
(gags)
So gross.
Yell.
I really... I'd really rather you not do that.
I haven't washed my hands since 3:00, and I'm gonna double-dip.
It's so gross...
How about now?
It's all the way, it's all the way in there, with all the...
it's so unsanitary. Please, just put it...
I'm-I'm begging you to... Please just take the towel!
This may be none of my business, but I-I-I really have to ask you:
Did anything happen between you and Nick?
Like, did you guys go out, or ...
What?
'Cause I, I really don't want to get in the middle of anything.
No. No.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Good.
Because I really want to see you again.
Big-time.
(laughs)
Big-time.
Big-time.
Like the play.
Yeah.
Cool play.
It is.
Do you really like him, Winston?
Yes, man! He asked me my grandpa's name.
You've never asked me my grandpa's name.
I don't know, Winston, I always just thought he was your grandpa.
I mean, you don't know my grandpa's name.
You mean Mason on your dad's, or Charles on your mom's?
Yeah, it's Mason and Charles.
SCHMIDT:
Ho, ho, ho, baby.
JESS:
Oh, that looks lovely.
Genzlinger!
Schmidt!
Yeah, buddy.
You kidding me?
Oh, it looks incredible.
It really does.
What if you play something for us before we start?
Before? Oh, no, no.
Yes!
Please?
Play.
You're all hungry. You know you want to do it.
Just do it. - Okay. - Please?
Twist my arm. - Okay.
All right. - Yeah.
Uh, duet from the pageant, huh?
(Whispering) Oh.
PAUL: Big entrance.
JESS: Okay.
Native Americans, gather ye round for I have a new friend I've met in the forest.
(Paul screams)
d*ad body! d*ad body!
PAUL: Holy God!
There's a d*ad body in there.
I think there's a d*ad body. There's a d*ad body!
There's a d*ad body!
Oh! That is real.
Ooh.
Oh! God.
That's a real thing.
What? (screams)
Poor Mrs. Beverly.
Oh, Ms. Beverly from the mailboxes.
I'm so sorry, Paul.
Oh, it was so fun. I had a great time.
WINSTON:
Anytime, bro.
Hey, listen, we're gonna go to a Best Buy, later, and grab a new dryer. Totally stop by if you need anything.
Oh, good, good. Okay. Thank you.
Oh. Okay.
All right.
Cool. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no.
Coming in. Coming in.
Guys...
No, no, no.
Get clear.
At least she d*ed doing what she loved.
She was on the toilet, Jess.
I'm starving.
Really? Even after that great meal we didn't have?
Oh, come on, Jess.
Are you going to be mad at me all night?
Are you cold?
Do you want my cardie?
(violin playing)
You came.
Yeah.
When I was on that elevator ride from hell, the coroners told me to stop crying like a girl.
I told them that was sexist.
You're right.
I am right.
And then I decided, life is too short.
So I went around the corner, picked up a couple of turkey subs for your friends ...
Yup.
They're foot-longers ...
and... here I am.
Just a man and his violin.
You're amazing.
MAN: Hey, no cutting!
Is he cutting?
He's not cutting. Relax.
Guys! We got a cutter here!
NICK: Calm down, pal. Stop.
(crowd murmurs angrily)
He's not cutting.
He's not cutting.
He's... I saved his spot.
Calm down.
False alarm!
He's just doing fair tradesies.
Honestly, stop overreacting to cutting!
I'm going to the back of the line. This spot's for Paul.
Thanks, Nick.
Thank you, Nick.
Hey. Nick.
Wait.
CECE:
Let's go. Come on.
Hey, I'll go back there, too.
JESS:
♪ Thursday in November ♪
BOTH:
♪ That's the day we remember ♪
♪ How the Pilgrims would have d*ed... ♪
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.
♪ If not for friendship of a tribe ♪

(laughing, whooping)
NICK: Where the hell are they going?
Cece!
Beep-beep.
(arguing)
Beep-beep.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
These traffic patterns are really...
counterintuitive!
Really...
Catch-as-catch-can as far as footpaths go over here!
Cece!
I got your text.
Are you ready to go home?
Argh! Thank you for coming.
Jess, he was making out with another girl.
You... get away from here.
Okay, who are you, Miss Pajama, okay?
You're blocking my booth. Get out of here!
Don't talk to her like that, okay?
That is my best friend!
(laughs) Oh, Cece...
You ripped my deep V!
This is my favorite deep V!
It´s just a deeper V.
Thanks for picking me up, Jess.
I really felt that Gavin was different.
Didn't you feel like he was different?
Yeah.
I mean, he seemed like a really nice...
European DJ with a face tattoo.
(men whistling, car horn honking)
Whoo!
Hey, guys.
I think... Jess, I think these guys are into you.
We should, we should just go back, right?
We should totally head back.
Where am I taking you?
Well, can't go home because Gavin's, like, staying at my place.
You've known him for three weeks.
Can I just crash with you for a couple days? Please?
I don't know. It's Friday night.
The guys probably have big plans.
(video game music playing)
Friday night, gentlemen.
It's on.
What happened to you?
It's on and poppin' up in here, you feel?
What happened to you?
What?
You didn't used to be like this, Schmidt.
What are you talking about?
You've gotten so much worse.
It's on and poppin'!
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
Yes. I told you I'd come through.
Okay, Benjamin just invited us to a very cool party.
I just got off three back-to-back shifts at the bar.
I just want to sit here all weekend in silence playing this game, then I want to go in my room and do weird stuff on my computer.
Are you even wearing underwear?
What is between you and that chair?
Just a little bit of sunshine.
(chuckles) All right, take off that kimono, please.
It's my leisure wear, Winston.
Look, I worked
80 hours this week.
I just want to come home, put on my 'mono and just hang loose, man.
Okay? If you had a job, you'd understand.
R-Really?
Wow! It just got real in here.
Okay, you're not gonna take the kimono off?
Fine. Then I'm not wearing any pants.
Boom! Bam!
Mm-hmm. Everybody want to just walk around this house wearing all kinds of stupid stuff, then guess what I'm gonna do, Schmidt.
I'm wearing a napkin on my face.
Bam! How you like that?
That doesn't even make any sense, Winston.
It makes perfect sense.
Totally different than me wearing my kimono.
You are laughing in the face of thousands of years of samurai culture, and it's an affront, Winston, it's an affront.
Look at me now, huh? This is the vibe we have in the house now because of you.
You want to walk around here looking silly.
This is handcrafted! In China.
(grumbles)
Schmidt, I think you should take the kimono off.
Um, Cece, can you not do your usual thing?
These are really good guys.
Best behavior.
Sure.
(men arguing)
Hey, guys, I brought...
You brought this on yourself!
What you doing?
Oh, you know, we're just chillin'.
Just chillin'.
Just doing this.
You know, Friday night.
I'm gonna use the ladies'.
What's up, Cecelia?
Where's the tequila?
Guys.
(sighs) Okay.
I would normally never bring her here, but Cece's really vulnerable right now, and when she's drunk, she has no boundaries.
So she's really grabby, really physical, she's really loose with her body.
So I just want to apologize in advance for anything that she might do.
That's good to know.
Yeah, thanks for telling us.
Thank you, guys.
You're the best.
(Dance music playing loudly)
This is the opposite of being alone!
This is the opposite of what I wanted this weekend.
Wow, how'd this happen?
Okay, I'm not a part of this, Schmidt.
I'm not a part of this.
Hi, Cece.
I'm gonna make you a bed on the couch, okay?
You have to stop dancing, okay, so you can go to sleep.
(deep voice): You know, Cece, I think you should dance if you want to.
Why are you talking like that?
Like what? I'm just hanging out.
You get up.
Really? Him?
But I'm doing this.
Come on, get up!
No, I don't dance.
I'm from the town in Footloose.
He doesn't want to dance, Cece.
I don't wanna dance. I'm really good.
Schmidt dances... Whoa! What the...
All right, you know what, I'm gonna go to bed. Good night.
That's really not great under here.
You have to love hair.
I think it's time for bed.
You can use my bed;
I'll sleep on the couch.
Over here. Over here, Cece.
Oh.
Over here. Over here.
Are you sheepdogging her?
Over here, over here.
Over here, over here.
Not here. Here we go.
(sighs)
Good night, Cece.
(music stops)
Yes! Yes.
She is sleeping on my sheets right now.
Not yours, bro. Mine.
Parkour!
You know what? I think I might actually have a chance with her.
I just have to be cooler than that guy.
Parkour!
A wise man once foretold of a magical night where I would engage in nonsexual foreplay with a model, my friends.
And tonight...
Don't say...is that night.
No, not a chance. Never gonna happen.
You're not a closer.
Oh, I'm a closer. I'm gonna close this conversation right now, my brother.
Watch this. Boom, bam, closed.
Parkour!
Short track speed skating.
Apolo Ohno.
Well, at least this tires him out, right?
Yeah.
Look, she's great. You're gonna love her.
Do you want some eggs?
No, I've got my own breakfast.
I don't need you to...
What?
I don't know.
Take care of me.
Just stop being so nice.
Your mother's being so nice.
Slam on my mother.
Your mother's gonna slam on your mother.
(screams)
And 4,000.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Wilkommen.
You're covered in oil?
What, oil? No.
This is just, uh...
You okay?
Schmidt.
Hey, are you okay?
Whoa. Whoa.
I just blacked out for a second.
Anything weird happen?
Okay, I need some water, so can you move?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, honey.
Just, you know, slide me like a curtain, okay?
(groans)
There you go. I'm good. I'm good.
Sweet.
Hey, can you get me a coff...
(shower running)
What's going on, guys? I ...
Hey. Oh, you're all here.
Um, does the water gets any hotter than this?
Uh, do you want me...
Uh I mean, I could give you, if...
NICK: I could... I'm good at fixing I can fix it, also.
Actually, you know what, I'll just figure it out myself.
But do you guys have any actual soap?
Because all I can find in here is body gelato.
That would be Schmidt's ...
Schmidt's gelato.
That gelato is mine.
If you could just... Don't use it all.
I'll just not touch it.
Okay.
Hey. Why are you guys all in here?
I'm brushing my teeth.
D-Doing my thing.
She hogging the shower? Cece come on. Hurry up.
CECE:
Sorry, j just... I can't find any bigger towels for some reason.
You have a really beautiful body, Cece.
I really appreciate that about you.
Okay, come on.
I did you breakfast.
You did?
Yeah.
Sorry. I just...
Disappointed with all of you.
Especially you.
It was a bad moment.
I thought you were better than that.
I know. I am sometimes.
Did you see that cleavage?
I just want to get my arm stuck down there.
127 Hours style.
And then, and then...
Just cut it for days. I don't care.
I'll cut through the bone, the nerve.
(makes snapping sound)
Schmidt!
You weren't upset 'cause I was dancing with Nick, right?
No, of course not.
'Cause I think he's really into you.
Nick?! No.
No!
Come on, Jess.
This is classic Eduardo.
You want this to go to Cece, right?
(heavy accent):
"Jess."
Okay, I'll give it to Cece.
No. Jess!
You don't want me to give it to Cece?
Sí, sí... uh, for you.
For me?
To give to Cece.
(groans)
We're just friends.
You can't be friends with these guys.
You don't think that every single one of them has thought about sleeping with you?
No, you just think everyone wants to sleep with everyone all the time.
They do. That's why I think that.
Don't you hear how he says your name?
"Jess."
He's from Chicago.
That's how people from Chicago say "Jess."
(Chicago accent):
Like "Bears" and "milk"
and "Let's go visit the Sears Tower."
(knocking)
Hey, Jess.
I'm going to the drugstore.
Need anything?
Yes.
Jess, you should go with him,
'cause then you can get that thing that you really need.
Oh, I wonder what that is.
She'll be right out.
Yeah, just...
No. No!
No, you are not coming in here and ruining all this.
I'm happy, I like these guys, and I think they're actually starting to like me, too.
Who did you tell me was your perfect man?
Walter Matthau in Grumpy Old Men.
And I could be girl Jack Lemmon.
He's a total Matthau!
I'm telling you, he gets you.
And did you see his feet?
A guy's feet point at what they want.
His feet were pointing right at you.
Why wouldn't his feet point at me?
Otherwise, he's standing like a duck.
Just come on. Go. Get out there.
NICK:
Hey, you ready?
Come on!
Be there in a sec, bro!
You just call me "bro"?
Yeah.
Well, how long is she staying?
Oh, not long.
I know she can be tough to deal with.
Sometimes she just calls me up and she's like,
"Bitch, I love you."
And then she just hangs up.
No other information.
Weird.
But I don't know, I kind of like it when she calls me "bitch."
It makes me feel like Janis Joplin.
NICK: Fine, but does she have to stay with us?
What? I'm sorry.
What-What did you say?
I'm saying stop trying to take care of everyone.
Oh, my God.
What?
What? - What!
Nothing. What?
What?
What are you doing?
I know she's your best friend, but I-I didn't mean to insult you.
Just, you don't have to take care of her...
Okay.
Yes.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm just checking...
I just want to make sure...
If I insulted you, I'm sorry.
But what are you doing right now?
Everything's in its place.
What does that mean?
Okay.
I'm just walking like a friend.
Okay, you know what, forget this.
Let's get out of here. Last on the list...
toilet paper.
Um, I don't use it.
You don't use toilet paper?
I mean... That's not what I meant.
That's what your mother meant.
What, did my mother call? What did she say?
No, Jess, I was... Jess, I was joking.
(whistles)
Look at her.
Go for it, man. You know, go do your thing.
I don't like the roof, man. There's a cat up here.
It's crazy. It was raised by birds.
You mean to tell me you're going to let a cat stop you from all that?
It's a bird-cat, man.
It's very dangerous. Look it up. Double rabies.
Right. You can't close.
You just said the magic words, son.
Baby, baby, don't cry.
Look, I get it.
I was the best lover you ever had.
Yeah. A 90-minute session's pretty standard for me.
It was god what?
Oh, it was godlike.
That's very sweet of you to say.
(phone ringing)
WINSTON:
My bad.
Pocket dialed you.
I got dropped calls, then Winston calls. It's crazy.
Uh, the roof, you know what I mean?
Hey, look, if he's ever bothering you...
You both are.
Cool, that's cool.
(cat meowing)
NICK: Okay, what's going on
with you, Jess?
Why do you have to do that?
Do what?
Why do you have to say my name like that? "Jess."
And why do you have to wear old man clothes all the time?
I don't wear old man clothes. You don't like the way I dress?
No, I just...
Did I do something to you?
No, I just need air.
Rose for the lady?
No.
Okay, I'll buy you one. Or two... they come as two? - No, no.
I'll buy two. - No, no.
Great. Thank you.
Wait, what do you mean no? Here, take some roses.
Want 'em? It's two dollars, it's not a big deal.
I want them to go, no.
They're nice roses...
Hey, what are you doing?! Where are you going?
Jess, it was a joke.
What are you doing? Get back in the car.
Where are you going?
That's not the way home.
Just working on Saturday.
Pulling in them ducats. It's crazy.
It's like golden handcuffs, you know what I mean?
It's like, on one hand I'm k*lling myself, and on the other hand, I'm making all this baller dough.
Ow!
Sunburn.
I told you to take that oil off.
It's cool, man. It's just a little color.
In a couple days I'll be brown just like you, Cece.
Because... because your culture is...
What is my culture?
It's, um... you're... Fff...
Um... Jjj... Jaflan...
Jafanese?
Uh, Sa-Saudi...
Saudiboo...
Um...
Monga...
My parents were born in India.
India... totally. Love India.
He really does.
Hey, Schmidt, why don't you tell her about all the things you love about India.
Uh, sure. I love, you know, uh, I love Slumdog.
I love naan, uh, pepper, Ben Kingsley, the stories of Rudyard Kipling.
I have respect for cows, of course.
I love, uh, the Taj Mahal, Deepak Chopra, anyone named Patel.
I love monsoons.
I love... I love cobras and baskets, Naveen Andrews.
I love mango chutney, uh, really, any type of chutney.
Teepees...
Hey, Schmidt, take a lap. Refresh.
Yep.
That was pretty good.
I know.
You're working a little too hard, though.
Watch this. Schmidt!
Yo.
Go up to the roof.
Yeah, I'm going to go up to the roof.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Cool. See you in, like, ten.
That was absolutely...
Make me a sandwich.
Sandwich.
I walked home.
I got out of the car and I walked home.
Why, what happened?
His feet were pointed directly at me the whole time.
Did I do this? Am I dressing too provocatively? Do I need to get thicker pajamas?
Maybe it's my posture. I have really sexy posture.
Don't worry about it.
I will talk to him for you.
No, you won't. That would be the worst, most life-ruining thing you could possibly...
Hi, Nick.
Seriously, Jess, what the hell happened? I've been driving around for the last hour looking for you.
Everything is okay, and we were hoping to get everything out...
BOTH: on the table.
The table which is not a table, it doesn't exist.
Don't worry about the table.
We were in the middle of traffic and you just got out and ran away.
I was hot.
You were so hot that you had to jump out of my car and run?
Why are you standing like that?
This is how I stand.
I've never seen you stand like that.
I was really worried something had happened to you, okay?
And you can't just walk around this neighborhood with bags full of toilet paper, that you don't even use.
What?
I told him I don't use toilet paper.
Okay, do you hear what he is saying to you?
Yes, I hear what he's saying ...
He's trying to tell you he cares about you.
No, he doesn't care about me.
So I'm going to make this happen for you.
He cares about me as a friend.
This is so on, Jess.
No, it is not.
No, on it is not.
I'm trying to help you...
No.
No.
Okay, my face is my job.
My face is my job.
Okay...
(yelling)
No! No!
My earring.
Okay.
It is stuck in your hair.
Can you get it out?
No.
Okay, we'll do it on the floor. We can do it on the floor. - Ow...
We're going to get it on the floor, don't worry. Okay.
Ow. - It'll be okay. All right, here we go.
What is wrong with you?
I'm trying to help you.
No, what is wrong with you?
No. I don't need your help.
You don't know... Nick and I are friends.
You don't know, 'cause you don't have guy friends at all.
You just hang out with jerks like Gavin.
Oh, I'm sorry... DJ Diabeat It.
He has diabetes.
Oh, he does? Boo-hoo.
I'm sorry. Is it really bad? I feel really bad.
He's fine. He takes medication.
Why do you just come in and you take over?
It's like you're playing mind games with people.
Don't put this on me, Jess. Ok, I'm trying to help you. You never make a move...
Well, I don't need your help.
I like moving slow. I like being weird and taking my time.
I'm not like you.
I don't just jump in the potato sack with the first potato that I meet with diabetes.
Okay, what did you just say?
You heard me, bitch.
(both laughing)
(Schmidt screaming) Oh...
What is that?
Oh, no.
What, what did you do?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What did you do?
(meows)
Hey, Schmidt. How you doing?
Can I sit with you on your cooler here?
Yeah. Just chillin', hanging with the cat.
Hola.
I'm sorry that Cece did this to you.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
I guess I'll just always be the fat kid with the big dreams.
It's not you.
I love Cece, but she's not ready for you.
You're a good guy, You know, if you ignore everything that you do on purpose, and concentrate on all of the things that you do by accident.
Thank you.
She'd eat you up.
You really think she'd eat me up?
Yeah.
Like buffet style?
You know, all you can eat?
'cause I got that prime rib, yo.
Carving station, plates are warm, sneeze guard, kids eat for free. I mean, except for the...
Except for the last...
All right, let's go. Let's go, Schmidt, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Cece. Um...
Look, I get it. This isn't going to happen.
But the couch is super uncomfortable, my sunburn's starting to blister, and I just want to sleep in my own bed.
Okay.
(jungle sounds)
I'm sorry for everything.
I can be a jerk sometimes.
I hate sleeping alone.
Me too.
Sweet.
Sch-weet...
Better when you don't talk.
Yeah.
If you tell anyone we held hands, I have two people in my phone that will k*ll you.
Literally.
Hmm...
Oh.
Hey. (Laughing)
I'm sorry I acted so weird today. Weird!
It's okay.
(brushing teeth)
(phone ringing)
Yo.
SCHMIDT: I did it, man.
I'm holding her hand right now. She's in my bed and she's asleep.
Wait, so you're in... you're in the room right now?
What is wrong with you? Hang up the phone.
I did it. I closed.
We could have this conversation at any time.
Shh. Please, shh.
Okay, we're good.
And just so we're clear, when I say "closing,"
this is not what I'm talking about.
You need to define your terms.
Because what I'm doing right now feels an awful lot like closing.
(scary movie music playing on TV)
(woman screaming on TV)
Ooh.
Scary movie.
I hate scary movies.
Why are we watching this?
We're not watching this, Jess.
We're watching it.
(scary movie music continues)
(groans)
So fun, hanging with the dudes, eating ice cream, watching scary movies.
(deep voice):
We're not scared; we're dudes.
Shh!
(woman screaming on TV)
(whispering):
You know what we should watch?
Have you guys ever seen Fame?
It's about a group of dreamers with talent to spare, taking New York City by storm, one dance number at a time...
the cafeteria, the street...
Oh! Ooh!
That's so much blood.
It's spurting!
Mmm, that was good.
That guy's gonna blow himself up.
** Wah, wah.
Why would that guy blow himself up?
(expl*si*n on TV)
Sorry. I saw it in the theater.
You know what else we should watch?
An American Tale.
It's about a little Jewish mouse with a great big heart and a...
All right.
Wait.
Where are you guys going?
** Hey, girl
** What you doing?
** Hey, girl
** Where you going?
** Who's that girl?
** Who's that girl? **
** Who's that girl?
** Who's that girl? **

New Girl S01E04
"Naked"
== SPREAD THE WORD ==
Do you know where you're taking her? No.
Do you need a list of my sexiest date spots?
You know, it's been a while for you.
Want me to stretch you out?
It's not a date, Schmidt.
Actually, I don't know what it is.
She's, uh... she's a little hard to read.
Wouldn't it be funny if we, like, went out? Like...
Do you want to go on a date? Yeah.
We, like, go for dinner, and, like, the two of us, like, do stuff.
Is that a yes? I know, right?
Seriously, do you want to get dinner...? Right. No, I know.
Sometimes she's so ironic that I think she's being serious.
I get it. Led Zeppelin is classic, but I mean, it's no, like, Steve Miller Band.
Steve Miller Band?
"The Joker"?
Oh, yeah. No, I love The Steve Miller Band.
Hey, look. You've been out of the game for a while.
I have three date packages.
They work every time.
Package A: Close-up magic, dinner, drinks.
Package B: Close-up magic, drinks.
Package C:...
Close-up magic.
You have a date? Fun!
I want to talk to you guys about this stuff.
With Amanda.
Schmidt. Amanda?
From the bar?
Whoa!
She's a looker.
Hatchie-matchie!
Yeah, I know how hot she is, Jess.
Have you been out with anyone since Caroline?
No.
Whoa! Big-deal alert.
Scary stuff, kids.
Yeesh!
Falling rocks. Bridge out. Duck!
This is why I don't talk to you, Jess.
Nick, you're gonna be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Just, you know, suck in the gut.
What gut?
The little pooch where you keep your extra cookies.
(exhales)
(exhales)
All right.
(stereo clicks on)

I had a lot of adventures in this room while you were gone, Winston.
(sighs) How'd the job interview go?
You know, terrible.
Did you see the JWoww retweet and Gaga Twitpic?
I know Word, and I can open a document...save it, save as, print, print preview...
She just wanted to chitchat about stuff I've never even heard of.
Well, you gotta get up to speed, man.
The chitchat is the interview.
I've spent the last two years of my life in Latvia.
I was playing ball year round.
I didn't read the news.
I have no idea what happened in America.
I've got interviews tomorrow.
Fill me in. What'd I miss?
From... from the past two years?
Give me the highlights. Highlights. Okay.
Uh, country's broke.
Betty White's back.
Oh, cool, cool. What about the rest of the Golden Girls?
All d*ad, man.
Damn. You know what? Give me your computer.

Oh, my God!
Look at you. You're like an animal.
What are you watching now? The King's Speech and Human Centipede.
Next up: Precious and David After Dentist.
I think you're doing a good job.
Okay, you know what, test me.
Pretend this is an interview. h*t me with the chitchat.
Ask me anything.
Chitchat. Let's go.
Forget it, man. Let's go!
Come on, what are you waiting for, man?
You're getting intense right now.
You're the intense one. I think you need to bring it down.
(clears throat)
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Something's happened.
It was totally an accident.
Not a big deal. I just want to do the mature thing and come clean about it.
But, um, I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee.
What? What'd she say?
I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee and his bubbles.
But it's not a big deal.
Ain't no thing.
(door opens)
Ain't no thaaang.
Oh, Nick, hey.
Hey.
So, that was weird, right?
I'm running out the door, Jess.
I think we should talk about it.
Talk about what?
About me seeing...
your peen.
(with British accent):
The peen what I saw.
(with French accent):
Bonjour, le peen.
You're blocking the door.
Okay. Cool.
Have fun on your date.
(laughs awkwardly):
Tell that guy to behave.
The adventure begins.
Okay. Excuse me, Jess.
(groaning)
That was so horrible. What am I gonna do?
He's never gonna speak to me again. I'm so embarrassed.
It's not a big deal. I've seen Nick's stuff, like, a million times.
You have?
I mean... how?
We grew up togethe Locker rooms, swimming pools, penis fights... it just happens.
Why haven't I seen it?
Why do you want to see it?
He's my best friend.
Again, why do you want to see it?
What if Nick gets into an accident?
What if he's horribly d*sfigured, and I have to identify him, and all that remains are his private parts?
And I'm standing there and I'm saying,
"Sorry, Officer, I can't help you, because no, I haven't seen his penis."
And then boom, he's buried in an unmarked grave.
Again, why do you want to see it?
What did it look like? What do you mean?
Just say when.
Just sa... serious...
Seriously? Are you s.. Are you serious?
Okay, you know what. This is impossible.
I'm starting over.
Schmidt, I need your help.
Okay... all right, Jess, fine.
What happened after you walked in?
I don't know. I kind of laughed.
Jess, you can't laugh at a naked man, especially Nick.
Nick is delicate...
like a flower.
Like a chubby, damaged flower who hates himself.
Now, listen to me. You're gonna act like this never happened.
We live together.
We're a family.
Families talk about things.
No. Families ignore things until they go away.
YOUNG SCHMIDT: Hey, Mom, hey, Mom, hey, Mom, I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!
Mom, Mom, Mom, I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!
No one wants to talk abou.
Never talk about this again.
Okay. I'll ignore it.
** Not gonna talk about...
Or sing about it.
The bing-bong. I'm done.
This is my... my chambre.
What does that mean?
You're a good kisser.
Can we, can we be serious?
Do you mind just being serious?
I'm gonna get serious... on your face.
(laughing)
I have no idea what that means.
(laughing)
Actually, let's not laugh when you're near my penis.
Take it off.
Here, just take your shirt off.
**
Can't...
Here. Do... Do you want me to go first?
You're offering just to take your...
Oh, my God!
Look at you.
Take off your clothes now.
President Obama.
Yeah, I like him to watch over me.
Do you, like, want to take it slow... or something?
This is nice. Yeah.
MAN (on video):
It's starting toven look like a triple rainbow.
(door opens)
MAN:
Oh, my God, it's full-on!
Hi, Nick.
So I guess your date went well.
Sleepover party.
I have something from school that, um... made me think of you.
It's a Feeling Stick.
Whoever's holding a Feeling Stick has permission to say whatever he or she is feeling without being judged.
I'll go first. Um...
I feel like I want to know what you're feeling.
Believe it or not, that's not the first time someone's broken my Feeling Stick.
I have a travel size.
Nick, wait!
Nick, we have to talk about this What are you doing?
I'm sorry I saw your doojer and your chickadees.
And I didn't mean to laugh. I just...
Then why did you laugh?
Is there something funny about it?
No.
It's beautiful.
Stately.
A real treat.
Oh, my God.
(whispering): I think it's great you dance naked to Jamaican music.
That's really cool.
You should explore your sexuality.
(bell dings)
Nick? Excuse me.
Come on, Nick. I dance naked all the time.
We have to talk about this.
Ugh! Nic
(sighs)
(bell dings)
Nick, please talk to me.
Jess, there's nothing to talk about.
You ruined my date.
Every time I tried to take my clothes off, Jess, I heard your little...
(imitates Jess's cackle)
Your little crazy giggle scream.
And all I want to do is have meaningless sex with a beautiful woman who, yes, talks in mind-bending riddles.
But I can't, because I can't get your little...
(screaming cackle)
out of my head.
Well, maybe you don't want to have meaningless sex.
Maybe that's not your style.
I have a bing-bong and chickadees.
It is my style.
Stop following me.
Then stop running away from me.
I just want to have a mature conversation.
How can we have a mature conversation when you can't even say the word "penis"?
I can say the word "pen..."
Say it. I...
"Peernyas."
What?
"Peernis."
You said "peernis."
** Penis. Not singing.
(deep voice):
Penis.
Not like a ghoul.
(chuckling):
I... I can say it!
Pianist. No, you said "pianist."
Enispay! Not pig Latin.
"Peernis."
Okay, not in Swedish.
"Pemo."
Not in fake Italian.
(shrieking):
Penis!
Shut up!
Say it with me... "pe... Pe...nis."
...neers.
Yeah, I'm the one that's immature.
Hey, man. Aah!
I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.
What? Just the g*n.
No. Just the roses.
What? Just the hub, where it connect Get out. Fine!
I thought we were best friends.
We are.
Apparently not.
Best friends don't do this, Schmidt.
They do it all the time.
You laughed? Yeah, I couldn't help it.
Did you freak out and make that noise that you always make?
What? I don't always make a noise.
(giggles, cackles)
Fine.
I guess I missed the moment when everybody got cool about sex.
I really messed up.
Ah, guys are simple.
You know what I would do? I would just make it even.
You've seen his; show him yours.
(sighs) No.
I can't do that.
Hey, Winston.
Oh, no. Oh, man.
The interview? Did you mess up?
No, I didn't mess up.
k*lled it. I was amazing.
At one point, I was on the outside of my body watching myself be amazing.
Well, that's a good thing, right? The woman asked me why I wanted to sell medical supplies.
I had no answer.
I've done anything but play basketball my entire life.
"Winston Bishop is an American basketball player
"who played professionally in Latvia, and he loves ducks."
Winston, did you write the part about the ducks?
I don't even like ducks that much, man.
Okay, look, man.
You got to get off Wikipedia, all right?
You're going crazy.
I was the guy who was good enough to play in Latvia.
And then one day, I don't know, man...
I just lost it.
They found another black guy.
Labak melno virietis.
Means "the better black guy."
A better melno?
You're-you're the best melno. I don't know, man.
I just don't know what comes next. You know what you do next? Come on. You're gonna get up.
Let's get up. Come on, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of the house.
We're gonna get you moving. It's gonna feel good.
Whoo! This feels good.
(out of breath):
Totally. I love it.
You know, I think I was just scared, man.
I've been playing basketball my whole entire life.
What if I was wasting my time?
Maybe I should have been figuring out my life like you.
(laughs) I don't have anything figured out.
I'm a fully-grown man with roommates.
I have a stupid job. I'm single.
My best friend won't even let me see his penis.
I mean, my whole life is a sham.
Aah!
I actually feel a lot better.
Thanks, Schmidt.
(gasping)
Winston, my legs!
Schmidt? My legs are seizing up.
Schmidt! I hate my life. I hate my...
making new discoveries.
I'm a fear-based person, apparently.
Stop it. Go. I need a...
Give me a hug, please. 911.
Ow. Ow.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night, Amanda.
So you're... you're, like, super into "cuddling."
No, I'm not super into cuddling.
I'm just getting out of a relationship, and I think I got nervous.
I've heard that I'm not great at talking about what I'm feeling all the time, and so I'm sorry about last night.
Honesty.
I like that.
(sighs)
(lock clicking)
NICK:
Really nice.
(Amanda chuckling)
AMANDA:
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
(panting):
Yeah. Yeah.
Take off your pants. Take off your pants! Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Take your pants off. Yeah? You want me to take them off?
Yeah. Yeah. Take them off. Yeah, take this... Want me to?
Okay. Want me to take these off? Yeah.
Okay, lights on, pants off. Here we go. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
NICK: Oh, I'm totally cool with this. (laughs)
Yeah.
(sighs) All right.
(chuckles)
Okay.
What are you doing?!
What is...?! Who is that?!
(screaming)
NICK:
What are you doing?!
Hi. I'm Jess.
Welcome to our home.
We live in a world with rules. We knock.
We have doors.
And we knock on those doors.
I'm sorry, Nick.
Just knock!
Nick... I...
Put that down. But we have to talk...
Nothing to talk about.
I feel that Nick is not honoring the Feeling Stick.
I feel me, too.
WINSTON:
I feel Schmidt's had a particularly bad day, and I feel that if Nick is truly Schmidt's friend, he would show Schmidt what's in his pants.
I feel supported.
What is going on with you two?
What are you doing?
I feel Nick is yelling.
Stop it!
(door slams)
Yo. I just wanted to thank you for taking me running.
Made me feel a lot better.
Now, I might not have a job or anything, but at least I can run a mile.
I mean, watching you try to run, yeah, that was just pathetic.
I needed that.
I suffer from exercise-induced asthma.
Do you suffer from exercise-induced crying?
It's a real thing, man, okay? EIA.
You know what I learned from the Internet?
We got nothing to worry about.
Everybody has their moment.
We might get a cat one day.
That cat might play the keyboard.
A bear might fall on our trampoline.
We don't need to have it figured out right now.
We just need to be patient.
Our moments will come.
Hey, man.
Let's keep bro'ing out.
(knock at door)
Come in.
Jess, you don't have to knock once you're in the room.
I worked on something for you.
All right.
Penis.
Very good.
Thank you.
Um, so did Amanda call you back?
No, I don't see Amanda calling me back.
I'm sorry. It's okay.
Maybe you were right.
Maybe I'm not ready for meaningless sex with beautiful women.
Well, you know, maybe when you are, you'll be able to show her your other penis.
Your heart penis.
Get out of my room. Okay.
Hey, um... (laughs)
when I was, um, leaving in a hurry, um, did you see...
everything?
Yup.
Even my... my gumbo pot?
Ugh. Gumbo pot? Get out.
(shower running)
Get out, Schmidt.
I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.
== SPREAD THE WORD ==
SCENE: Jess' room, trying on dresses whilst Nick and Schmidt are sitting on the bed waiting for her.
JESS: It's our first wedding together, so we need nicknames. Nick is 'Nicknack' or 'Mr. Suspenders'...
SCHMIDT: No nicknames, okay, your only job tonight, is to be Nick's girlfriend, okay and make sure he stays out of trouble with Caroline.
JESS: Why can't you and Winston help?
SCHMIDT: We've tried, he doesn't listen to us anymore.
FLASHBACK - Nick sitting on the floor crying about Caroline whilst Schmidt stands in the doorway trying to         comfort him.
SCHMIDT: She's not coming back. (Nick cries even harder).
NICK: He's right, I don't.
JESS: [Coming out of the closet with a hideous, yellow, floral dress] Tah dah!
SCHMIDT: No!
NICK: [Eyes wide] That is the ugliest dress I have ever seen, Jess.
SCHMIDT: I'm really gonna need you to step it up tonight, okay, when I see you I wanna be thinking who let the dirty slut out of the sluthouse?
Jess: [In an English accent] Probably the slut butler, right?
Winston: [Sticking his head around the door] Yo, let's go, we can't be late, I am in the wedding.
Nick:You're the usher, so relax.
Winston: Yeah I'll be busy, that way I won't have to sit around answering a bunch of stupid questions all day, like, 'Do you have a job', 'Are you still playing basketball?' Does it look like I'm still playing overseas basketball?
Schmidt: What is the matter with you?
Winston: This is the first job I've had in like, two months, dude, and I really just want get in there and ush this wedding in the face!
Schmidt: You're gonna be great, man.
Jess: So when we do the chicken dance, I do it a little bit differently. I know that usually it goes: Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh, [realising she went wrong] duh duh duh duh duh duh duh, mmm mmm mm... But instead of the clap, I like to do a peck, because it's more realistic. [Miming the actions]
Nick: No chicken dance!
Schmidt: Okay, look, we're not trying to be mean, we just don't want you to be yourself... in any way.
Jess: Okay, suppress the Jess. Got it.
Schmidt: [To Nick] Did you use my hair gel?
Nick: Did I use your hair gel?
Schmidt: I'm not gonna be mad, just let me know if you did.
Nick: No.
Schmidt: Sure?
Nick: I used your hair gel.
Schmidt: Are you serious?
Nick: Yeah.
[Jess comes out of the closet in a pretty purple dress]
Schmidt: Who let the dirty slut out of the sluthouse?
Nick: Wow! You look great!
[Reveals prop teeth]
Jess: [speaks in a Southern American accent but inaudible]
Schmidt: NO! [Walks off]
Nick: No teeth, Jess! You can't use prop teeth! [Walks off]
Jess: Come on, guys. These are hilarious, kids love these.
ROLL TITLES - The short version
[In the foyer to the wedding, Jess, Nick, Winston and Schmidt enter and begin mooching]
Jess: Wanna know one of my beauty secrets? The only way I could fit in this dress was by wearing little girls' bicycle shorts underneath, they are tight! I will not be peeing tonight. Oh my god, bubbles.... [heads off towards the bubbles]
Nick: [heads after her clutching her arm and guiding her away] No, no, no, no, Jess, no bubbles, no bubbles, please!
Schmidt: Hoohoo, a lot of big game here tonight, yoohoohoo. [Sees Brooke] Oh, oh there's Brooke.
Jess: Who's Brooke?
Nick: He's been into her, since freshman year. She used to get drunk and pass out on our front porch. It was like having a hot, alcoholic cat.
Schmidt: I'd always leave water out for her. Okay, tonight just got real. She's go on top of the 'k*ll list'.
Jess: Is that because you're going to attempt to k*ll her by having sex with her?
Schmidt: More or less,  yeah.
Jess: Oh, Schmidt, one day you're gonna k*ll the nicest girl.
[In the garden, Jess is doing Nick's tie]
Jess: Look at my new boyfriend, so fancy in his big-boy tie.
Nick: Jess, would you please stop?
Jess: Okay, what is it with Caroline, you're like a different person?
Nick: Just focus on getting through today, please.
Jess: Okay Mr. Boy T Friend.
Nick: What did I tell ya?
Jess: Huhuh, don't be myself.
Nick: Yes.
Jess: It's what I love about our relationship, you never let me be myself.
[Winston is standing, waiting to do his job]
Man: Hey, Winston.
Winston: Hey.
Man: You're back.
Winston: Yeah.
Mam: What are you up to? Where you working at?
Winston: Here, as an usher. [Turns to a woman who is waiting to be seated] Hi, what a beautiful dress.
Jimmy: I'm surprised you noticed the dress, I was distracted by the woman inside. Jimmy Longjam, alternate usher.
Winston: Alternate usher, I mean, I'm here. I'm the usher.
Jimmy: You were late, it's called commitment. Look it up in a typewriter, old man.
Winston: What?!
Jimmy: How much money do you make?
Winston: Where is your mother?
Woman: Can somebody help me?
Jimmy and Winston: Hello, bride or groom?
Woman: Oh, thank you. [To Jimmy]
[Nick, Jess and Schmidt]
Schmidt: Oh no, no, not tonight, no! [Looks at someone]
Jess: Who is that?
Schmidt: It's Gretchen Nelson, she's a terrible person. We can't stand each other, at every wedding we end up having sex.
Flashback: Schmidt and Gretchen getting it on in the closet at some wedding with the Bridal March on in the background. Then Schmidt and Gretchen getting it on in a store cupboard at some wedding. End.
Schmidt: I mean, the sex was amazing. She's coming over.
Nick: Hey, there are those people that we know.
Jess: Oooh, what people? [Both walk off and leave Schmidt alone.]
Schmidt: [Clears his throat] Hello, Gretchen. I see you wore the pant suit again.
Gretchen: This is a new one. It's got way more stretch, in the pants.
Schmidt: That's horrible.
Gretchen: Are you ready for tonight? I'm gonna tie you down and show you pictures of my river rafting trip.
Schmidt: Oh, god, how many are there?
Gretchen: It's a two hour slide show.
Schmidt: No! Gretchen, we can't do this anymore, okay. It's not...it's not healthy, alright, please, no more.
[Sitting in their chairs, Caroline is staring at Nick with Jess]
Nick: There she is, there she is, she's right over there. She's right over here. Just be cool.
Caroline: [Coming over] Hi.
Nick: Hey, Caroline, wow! I didn't know you were gonna be here. It's good to see you.
Jess: Nicholas, you have to introduce me.
Nick: Uh, yeah, of course, er..Jess this is Caroline.
Caroline: Hi.
Jess: One more time, Caroline? [with and ee sounding i]
Caroline: Uh, Caroline.
Jess: Caroloo...Coraline?
Nick: Caroline!
Jess: Oh, kay, fancy. Well, I'm Nicholas' girlfriend, we just started dating so we're still in that honeymoon phase. I barely sleep, so much doing it.
Nick: So much doing it, it's crazy.
Jess: He's so soft, like a towel.
Caroline: Well, uh, it was nice to meet you.
Jess: It was so nice to meet you too, Carol.
Caroline: Caroline.
Jess: [Laughs] i give up.
Caroline: I guess I'll, see you later.
Nick: Sure. [To Jess] Oh my god, was she jealous? I think she was jealous. You did so good. That was remarkable.
Jess: [Puts on prop teeth] I'm just doing what ma momma learnt me.
Nick: [Holding out his hand] Gimme the teeth. [Jess drops them into his hand]
[Scene: At the bar, after the ceremony]
Schmidt: Hi, wow, Brooke. Schmidt. You used to worry my poncho, freshman year. Remember that? No? Fat Schmidt?
Brooke: Fat Schmidt! Of course! Wow, you look great.
Schmidt: You, also, sure, um, how are your classes? I mean...not that we're, not that we're in school anymore, I know that. What...what are you drinking? White wine?
Brooke: I'm not drinking. I'm sober, six months. Can I get a saltzer, please?
Schmidt: Me too.
Brooke: You're six months sober, also?
Schmidt: Seven months, one more.
Brooke: Wow! That's great! Congratulations.
Bartender: Here's your white wine.
Schmidt: What? That's a mistake, no I didn't order that. No. No, sir! [Even the smell of it...]
Brooke: I'm going back to my table, but you can come talk to me, if you need to.
Schmidt: Okay, thank you. [To bartender] So what I need you to do is this, I need you to put vodka in a water bottle, okay, and rendezvous with me in the restroom, okay? Same page, same page?
[Scene: In the venue]
Jimmy: [Laughs at Winston]
Winston: [To Nick] This kid is pushing my buttons.
Nick: Winston, he's just a little boy, relax.
Schmidt: If Brooke asks, I six months clean and sober, and looking to settle down.
Nick: Great. [To Jess] Schmidt's sober. What are you doing? [She is touching his face]
Jess: She's looking at us. [Waves at Caroline] Your head is shaped like a yam.
Nick: Yeah I know, I can't wear soft hats. Hey, when she comes here I want to talk to her about myself.
Jess: No.
Caroline: Hi, could that ceremony have lasted any longer? [Laughs at own joke]
Jess: Hahaha. We loved it, taking notes, unless Mr. Commitment Phobe over here, decides to make an honest women out of me.
Caroline: Oh.
Nick:: Hey, Jess. Did you wanna go do that thing, for um...?
Jess: Yes, I did. I wanted to do it very badly... [Leaves]
Nick: Thank you.
DJ: And now, for the first time ever, Mr and Mrs Hammond.
[Jess walks right into the doorway where the bride and groom are entering through]
Jess:  [Looks awkwardly around] Yay! Bride and groom! Make way! Hazaar! Celebrate love! Get ready for a wonderful life of merriment and joy.
Caroline: Jess is...great.
Nick: Yeah, the best. So happy.
Caroline: Are you guys pretty serious?
Nick: Yeah, we are pretty serious. Yeah, we live together. I mean different bedrooms but shared bathrooms, so that's something.
[Scene: Schmidt at the bar]
Schmidt: Alcohol, any kind of alcohol you have. Just gimme anything. Thank you.
Gretchen: Gimme that.
Schmidt: Oh God. It's like you're lapping it out of a puddle.
Gretchen: Eugh, where did you get those boots? Off a lady hiker?
Schmidt: Look at those earrings. Are they clip ons?
Gretchen: [Whispers] I'm gonna make you wear them.
Scmhidt:... Huh. No!
[Jess is sitting at a table pulling at her shorts]
Jess: Is it bad that I can't feel my legs?
Schmidt: Yes, now let's talk about my problems. Jess, I have to go home with Brooke tonight. I deserve someone like Brooke, she's perfect and it doesn't matter that I have gymnastic mean spirited, highly educational sex with Gretchen, it's just, that's not what I want to do anymore, okay? Not tonight.
Jess: What's so bad about liking Gretchen, I mean you guys obviously have like a weird connection?
Schmidt: No, no, no. I wanna connect with Brooke. I wanna connect with her in the shower, on the floor, sitting Indian style.
Jess: Okay, you know what, you can keep talking but I'm gonna put my hands over my ears.
Winston: We got a problem. [They look over at Nick and Caroline talking]
Schmidt: Jess, what did you do?
Jess: Look, they're fine. They're just talking.
Schmidt: No, not fine.
Winston: No, no, no. With Caroline, he is not fine. Okay, he ran into her at a party two months ago, then sent me a ten page email about what she meant when she said 'I'll see you soon'.
Schmidt: She will flirt with until she knows she can have him. It's like he's her back up plan.
Jess: I didn't know that.
Schmidt: You wanna live with Nick when he's not showering and crying all day?
Winston: Yeah, it sounds like this. [Imitates Nick]
Schmidt: You ever heard a grown man sob listening to Simon and Garfunkel?
Jess: Yeah, my dad.
Schmidt: Yeah.
Jess: Okay, I get it, I'll go but I just...these biker shorts are really tight...
Schmidt: [Getting her up] Come on, work through it.
Jess: Okay, okay.
Schmidt: It's all on you, Jess.
[Jess starts dancing in front of the table where Nick and Caroline are sat]
Jess: Come on in, honey. The water's fine.
Nick: Jess, you know I don't dance.
Jess: Oh, but you didn't know that I did this. [starts to mime dance] I'm mime walking, I'm Mimechael Jackson.
Nick: [Laughs nervously]
Caroline: I'm gonna get a drink.
Nick: Me too.
Jess: Nick, wait, no.
Nick: Yes, relax this is good, I may actually have a chance and it's all because of you so thank you.
Jess: No Nick, that wasn't my intention. Nick, Nick! [Jimmy comes up and starts dancing with Jess] Oh, hi. I don't feel like dancing right now, I'm sorry. I'm really uncomfortable right now.Oh Winston, thank God. Nick got away!
Winston: Nick can wait, this, this is about honesty. [Starts having a dance off with Jimmy]
DJ: And, looks like we have a dance off.
Winston: What?! [Starts grinding on Jess]
Jess: Oh my God, what are you doing?!
Jimmy: Mom! Mommy?!
Jess: Nick? Nick!?
[Scene: Later on in the after party, Schmidt approaches Brooke]
Schmidt: The chocolate fountain, it reminds me of the one in Tuscany, you ever been?
Brooke: Yeah, I was just there for New Year's, where's the chocolate fountain?
Schmidt: I don't know, I've never been, I'm just fascinated with the culture.
Jess: [From the other side of the room] Schmidt! Schmidt! I need you to help me take these off so I can go find Nick!
Brooke: God, are you friends with that girl?
Jess: Schmidt?!!
Schmidt: Look, I didn't want to have to tell you this but, she was a mistake I made when I h*t rock bottom. I was her Sid and she was my Nancy and then I got sober and she couldn't deal with it and the poor thing just went, she went crazy.
Jess: Schmidt! I need you to help me slap my thighs around!
Schmidt: I don't want to scare you, but she can be very dangerous when she drinks. Okay, I shouldn't even be in the same room as her, it's just, it feels so good talking to you.
Brooke: Maybe we should get you out of here.
Schmidt: What a great idea, ues.
Brooke: I just have to go to the bathroom really quickly.
Schmidt: Whatever you need, whatever, yeah, of course.
[Scene: Nick and Caroline are in a photo booth]
Nick: Ready, no lips. Name one, name one.
Caroline: Do, uh, wind tunnel!
Nick: Super high drivers license.
Caroline: [Laughs] Can we stay in here all night?
[Scene: Brooke walks into the restroom and finds Jess in there]
Jess: Oh, hi! Schmidt is very fond of you.
Brooke: Um, look, I..I don't know...I don't even know him that well, okay?
Jess: Oh! I'm just cutting off my underwear, you know, girl stuff. [Rips them off] Ahh. So tight. Well, it's been really nice chatting with you but I've gotta pretend boyfriend to hunt down, I think he's cheating on me [Brandishing a pallette Kn*fe] and don't break Schmidt's heart, or you'll have me to deal with. [Laughs]
[Scene: Nick and Caroline still in the photo booth]
Jess: [Pulls back curtain of photo booth] Aha! I trusted you!
Nick: Jess, get outta here.
Caroline: Nothing happened.
Jess: After everything we've built.
Nick: Go away, Jess, please.
Jess: Who are you?
Caroline: No, really, nothing happened. I have a boyfriend.
Nick: Wait, you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: Yeah, well I've been seeing someone. I didn't want to bring him because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but now I know that you have Jess...
Jess: Yeah, he has me... and our baby!
Caroline: Okay, I'm just gonna let  you guys...
Jess: And our other baby!
Schmidt: [Goes up to Jess] Jess, what happened with Brooke?
Jess: What?
Schmidt: She just left here in tears because she said that you thr*at her with a Kn*fe!?
Jess: No, I was talking you up.
Schmidt: No, you shouldn't have been talking me up, you should've been taking care of Nick. Why is it so hard to do one thing?
Jess: How is this my fault?
Schmidt: Ruiner.
Jess: Uh, did you just call me a ruiner?
Schmidt: Yeah.
Jess: Okay, you know what, forget it. I'm not helping you guys anymore. Give me my teeth back. [Goes in Nick's jacket]
Nick: Stop it, Jess.
Jess: You don't appreciate them.
Nick: Cool it!
Jess: Give them back. I'm gonna have fun, [puts in teeth] cause there's nothing wrong with who I am, and I like having fun at weddings, and I like dancing, and if you don't like that, then tough teeter tots, tooter. Jess is back. [Storms off]
Gretchen: [Walks over to Schmidt] Ah, you going home with me aren't you? [Puts the clip on earrings on him] Good boy. [Slaps his ass]
[Scene: Drunken Nick being filmed for the happy couple]
Nick: [Holds up pictures from the photo booth] That's Caroline and that's me. Four years we were together so...it doesn't matter to me, it's just what matter is..respect. [Crying] I'm just so alone right now, man and it's a real bad situation...
Camera Man: Uh, Steve and Bree.
Nick: Steve and Bree, because that's what this is about, I agree with you, you're good at your job, man. [Turning to the cardboard cut out of Steve and Bree] I'm so happy for you, you look great, it feels a little bit like you're rubbing it in my face, you know, happiness, but let's be honest, Bree, this doesn't look great on you. [Gestures to the dress] This. That's not a great look, Bree! Congratulations, Steve, nice fedora and no open bar, Steve, don't you understand that's tacky! You're dad's rich, you're a lawyer, man. [Kicks over cardboard cut out] Yeah! That happened! [Goes over to the photo booth] The photo booth is a liar, fyi. [Opens curtain] Oh, hey ladies, you guys wanna see a grown man cry? No? Then get out! I think I saw a single doctor looking at you. [To one of the women] This is gonna take a while, Orange.
[Scene: Jess. sitting at a table, bl*wing bubbles]
Jess: Hi there, partner.
Winston: [Sits down and put his feet up like Jess] Hey, can I tell you something you promise to never tell Schmidt? I love bubbles! [Laughs] I don't know why, I just always have. [Takes the bubbles and bl*ws some, laughs again] You see that, that was like two in one.
Jess: Woah.
Winston: Are you okay?
Jess: Yeah, I'm fine.
Winston: Those guys were jerks, but I know that they're glad you're around.
Jess: Really?
Winston: Yeahh, I'm just gonna come out and say it, especially Nick, but they're all thinking it. Even me. Most of the time.
Jess: [Smiles] It was weird, when I was stuck in a freak sandwich between you and that eight year old. Do you wanna talk about that?
Winston: [Sniggers] You know, it's just that he got to be a bit annoying, so.. I kinda took my feelings out with dance...? [Jess laughs]
Schmidt: Okay, er, so, we have a situation.
Scene: [Nick drunkenly talking in the photo booth to himself]
Winston: Hey, Nick.
Nick: It's mine now.
Winston: How're you doing, buddy?
Nick: They want me to leave the booth...but I'm staying. This is my home now. It's got everything that I need.
Schmidt: [Showing the pictures to Jess] You can see by looking at these pictures, that he's experiencing a variety of different emotions. This one is... well that's actually his butt. He just keeps saying, Jess.
Nick: Jess! The fact is, is I was a mean person and I'm sorry, okay?
Jess: [Pokes her head into the booth] Hi, Nicholas.
Nick: Hey, Jess. I live in a photo booth, now.
Jess: Oh, is that so?
Nick: Yup. Come on in, come on in. That's the kitchen area.
Jess: Very nice.
Nick: This is the common area.
Jess: Oh, okay.
Nick: Dining room, living room, kind of everything.
Jess: It's very nice. Hey...she had a boyfriend...
Nick: Yeah.
Jess: She shouldn't have been flirting with you all night. You can't be her back up plan. You have to let each other go. So now, you have to make a decision. Am I gonna stay locked in a photo booth for the next hour or am I gonna get out there, take my shoes off and dance my face off. [Laughs] Come on, it's up to you. [Leaves]
Nick: Oh, man, all right. [Pats the wall] I love you photo booth. [Leaves]
[Scene: Winston walks into the main room, and looks over at Nick and Caroline talking]
Winston: [Walks over to the table where Jess and Schmidt are] Yo, look at him. He looks better.
[Nick and Caroline]
Nick: I can't do this anymore. I have to let you go, Caroline, for real. It has to be over.
Caroline: [Sighs] Um... [Hugs him]
Nick: Goodbye, good luck and everything.
Caroline: Good bye.
Nick: Alright, um, I've gotta, excuse me. [Walks over to Jess, just as a song comes on] Come on, Jess.
Jess: What?
Nick: Just please? Just come with me, right now. [She gets up and they walk onto the dancefloor and face each other] [Nick starts doing a slow motion chicken dance to the music]
Jess: [Laughs and joins in]
Schmidt: You know, that looks like so much fun. [Gets up and joins in]
Winston: [Laughs and joins in too]
Schmidt: Check out my beats.
Winston: Stop copying my beats.
[Credit Scene: Schmidt tied to Gretchen's bed]
Schmidt: Gretchen, you think that like, hooking up at all these weddings...I mean one of these times, we go on an actual date.
Gretchen: No! I'm just using you for your body.
Schmidt: Oh, okay, cool. How many more of these things?
Gretchen: We're just getting started.
Schmidt: That yellow helmet is... ugh.
Gretchen: Tonight, I'm gonna get certified on the River Schmidt.

JESS: You wan't my help? Sure.
SCHMIDT: You consider me a sexy man, correct?
JESS: I don't know how to answer that question.
SCHMIDT: Okay look, I'm meeting a girl for drinks tonight, and I'm probably going to bring her back here, for sex.
JESS: I have to get to school cause it's astronomy day and I'm dressing up like Galileo, so I have to put on my beard.
SCHMIDT: I get that, but as a lady, where in the room do I look sexiest? You know like, like where am I best on display? Here? (Sits in armchair, legs crossed holding head) Here? (Sits on arm of armchair) Or (runs over to bed) here? (lies on bed on his side)
ENTER NICK
NICK: Hey, what is going on out here?
JESS: Um, Schmidt wants to know where in his room he looks the sexiest.
NICK: Well it's a big room. What are your choices?
SCHMIDT: Ok, I'm glad you asked. Alright, (waves hand across bed) here? (runs over and sits in armchair) Here? (sits on arm of armchair again) Or here? You know, maybe just reading a book or something.
NICK: It's a lot of options. Could you do them again really fast?
SCHMIDT: You wanna see them again?
NICK: Please.
SCHMIDT: Ok. Here? Here? Here?

JESS: Guess I'm not the new kid anymore, I'm just one of the guys.
NICK: You're still the new kid, Winston lived here before Coach did.
JESS: (Carries on preparing breakfast) So Coach said, (sh*t of Schmidt walking by, taking earphones out) that they used to play basketball together at college, but then Winston went pro...
SCHMIDT: In Latvia, okay? He went pro in Latvia, there's a big difference. (Nick turns around to look at him) Well the team logo, is a fig. Just a.. just a one single fig.
JESS: Oh, you're jealous. (Turns around) That's so cute. (Turns back)
SCHMIDT: (Smirks) Of Winston? No no no. Look, I'm not jealous of Winston. Ok, it's been two year, he's gonna have to recognize, I'm a lot flyer now. Wanna see me flex my base? (Starts to take off shirt)

SCHMIDT: (Takes off shirt) Let me flex my base. Let me flex my base, man.
NICK: Put your shirt on.
SCHMIDT: Baboom.
NICK: It's the morning.
JESS: (Whispers whilst carrying the breakfast tray) He's gonna love it.
NICK: Jess, what are you doing? (To Schmidt) What is she doing?
(Jess kicks opens the door, walks in and places the tray on the floor, loud enough to wake Winston. Winston wakes with a start.)
WINSTON: What the.. what the.. (points at Jess) who?
JESS: I'm Jess.

NICK: I totally told you he was hungover. I said he was drunk at the bar and now he's passed out.
(ENTER WINSTON)
JESS: Hi, Winston. Hey, I apologize for what happened before... not cool, bad call. I've been talking to the guys about boundaries, so I totally get it.
WINSTON: Perfectly fine, no problem.
JESS: Do you have a t*nk top I could borrow? You look like you're about my size. It's just that I'm really low on clothes right now cause I broke up with my boyfriend. And I caught him cheating and... I just like grabbed whatever I could and...
SCHMIDT: (Steps out of the shower) Jess, you know what? I'll let you check my lost and found. It's where I keep all the things the girls leave behind in my room after we've founicate. I've got sizes 0 through 10. (Jess and Schmidt leave)
WINSTON: What have you done to me Nick?
NICK: I am so happy you're back.
SCENE: Schmidt and Jess are sitting on the bed, with a box in front of them.
JESS: (Rummaging through the box, she pulls out stiletto) You have made love to a lot of forgetful women.
SCHMIDT: (Taking shoe off her) Ah man, look at these, wow. (Sees Jess taking out hair extensions from the box) Oh, look at that, Rochechana 06. Yeah, nothing orthodox about what we did that night.
JESS: Winston seems nice...
SCHMIDT: Did he say anything to you about the room?
JESS: What room?
SCHMIDT: The big room, I kinda took it from him when he left, I used to be in the small room. (Pulls out shirt from box that says 'I AM CLAIRE'.) This happened in the small room. (Looks at it) Twice. Never going back there again, Jess.
SCENE: Winston and Nick are tossing a basketball back and forth between then in the main living area of the loft.
NICK: He's never gonna give you that room back.
Winston: Psshhhh, come on man, it's Schmidt. You know they have a saying in Latvia. 'That guy is so stupid we could easily take things away from him'.
NICK: (Laughs) That's a saying?
WINSTON: (Laughs) Yeah, it is.
NICK: That's a weird saying. (Bounces ball and throws to Winston who sh**t and scores)
ENTER JESS
JESS: (Wearing borrowed clothes) What d'ya think?
NICK: Jess, I've been telling you this for weeks but you gotta call Spencer and you gotta get your stuff back. Unless, you know, unless you're scared.
JESS: No, I'm not scared, it's just complicated. That stuff was... that stuff was ours and I miss him. (Starts to get upset.)
SCHMIDT: Jess, look, it's a ball. (Throws ball to Jess)
JESS: Oh, a little b-ball huh, (laughs). (Whilst bouncing ball) You know, I'm actually pretty good. I used to play with my mom. (Half-singing and still bouncing ball) Defense! Defense! Watch out for the defense! Sneaky sneaky wah wah.
NICK: (To Winston) You get used t`o it.
JESS: Hey, Schmidt! (Bounces ball really hard in Schmidt's general direction and smashes the TV)
NICK: Ah, come on!
JESS: (Puts hands over her face) Uh!
SCHMIDT: Wow! (Sarcastically)
JESS: (Removes hands from face) Oh! (Breathes heavily) My bad!
NICK: (Holding the bridge of his nose) Uuuuuuuuurgh.
JESS: I'm sorry, you guys.
NICK:  That was my TV, Jess.
SCHMIDT: Kinda all he had.
JESS: I'll get you a new one I just can't it afford it right now.
NICK: If ya don't mind me asking, what's the plan?
WINSTON: You don't know me like that but I need a TV.
NICK: Do you have a TV at Spencer's?
JESS: Yeah, I do, it's just really big and thin and brea...
NICK: Go get it!
JESS: No, I can't, I haven't spoken to Spencer since he cheated on me with that hoe! Actually, that's not fair, she might be a really nice hoe. I just don't wanna get in a big fight with Spencer, I want to be friends with him eventually.
NICK: Why do you wanna be friends with your ex? I don't wanna be friends with Caroline, and all she did was rip me open and tear out my heart out with her perfect, perfect hands.
JESS: He has this power over me, like he's a wizard and I'm his mage and I think it's his hair, he has like this really beautiful hair, and whenever I see it I get the 'woowoos'.
NICK: Oh my god, I hate my life!
SCHMIDT: Ok guys just.. Jess look, I know, closure, ouch, am I right?
JESS: I don't know at all what you're saying right now.
SCHMIDT: Ok Jess, think about it...
NICK: Ok Schmidt, it's not that complicated, Jess just get the TV back!
WINSTON: I need a TV.
NICK: It's important! It's a television! It's what brings all of.. Just get us the TV!
JESS: Okay, it's not a big deal. I'll do it. I'll call Spencer, and I'll talk to him, and, I, will talk, to, him. So, yay.
SCHMIDT: Yay.
[JESS SITTING ON A BENCH, WATCHING SPENCER RIDING TOWARDS HER ON HIS BIKE]

SPENCER: (Takes his helmet off and shakes his hair out in slo-mo, movie style) Hi, Jess-jess.
[THE GUYS IN A CAFE, AT A TABLE, EATING BREAKFAST]
WINSTON: Wow, I miss this place. How's your yoghurt thing, Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: Oh, the parfait? It's parfait.
NICK: Come on, don't...
SCHMIDT: (To the hot waitress) Oh, hello. You look beautiful today. You look smart.
HOT WAITRESS: Stop talking to me, Schmidt.
WINSTON: So, you're making all the calls now, Schmidt?
SCHMIDT: Sure...
WINSTON: This must mean, you're the top dog?
SCHMIDT: Yeah?
WINSTON: (Exchanging glances with Nick) That's cool...
SCHMIDT: You know, i'm glad you guys think that, cause... you know I think that too.
WINSTON: One hundred percent, I mean, when I moved out, obviously there was a power vacuum.
NICK: Yeah, I needed a leader, I didn't know which end was up.
SCHMIDT: Yeah, Nick's the bottom if you know what I mean.
NICK: Absolutely, say Winston, do all top dogs need the biggest room or, I dunno, is that knida cheesy, a little over k*ll?
WINSTON: No no no no no. Though I definitely see what you're saying though, definitely. Uh, every top dog is differt, every top dog is different. Hey, Schmidt, what uh, what kind of top dog are you?
SCHMIDT: ...the kind with the big room.

JESS: Rochelle...fancy name.
SPENCER: She's great.
JESS: Rochelle like a mermaid.
SPENCER: Yeah.
JESS: (Puts on weird voice and picks up parts of her hair) Hello. I'm Rochelle and I eat fish.
SPENCER: Yeah, we have a lot in common, see we both love bikes...
JESS: I love bikes...
SPENCER: Not enough.
JESS: Um, Spencer. I need my stuff back. My TV, all my winter clothes.
SPENCER: Yeah, of course. I would have brought it today but I rode my bike here. You know, without the basket.
JESS: Ok. Well, when will it be a good time for me to come over...?
SPENCER: (Interrupting Jess and changing the subject) It's so good to see you Jess.
JESS: Spencer, I really need my stuff..,
SPENCER: Shuuuuuuuusshhh. I need something too.

[JESS IN A PAWN SHOP TRYING TO BARGAIN WITH THE OWNER FOR A TV]
JESS: $550 for the TV? Seems a little steep. I'm gonna write down a figure and this is as high as I go. (Draws something on a piece of paper)
PAWN SHOP OWNER: You drew a smiley face.
JESS: I'm a teacher. Do it for the kids.
PAWN SHOP OWNER: For the kids, $550.
JESS: I can't go home without a TV, I thought pawn shops were about helping people and frankly, right now, I feel taken advantage of. I just got out of a long relationship and I don't know what I'm doing emotionally or lets be honest, sexually. (Picks up her bag to go) I'll just, I'll just get out of here. (Tries to steal the TV but fails miserably.)
PAWN SHOP OWNER: Are you trying to rob me?
[BACK IN THE LOFT, NICK IS WATCHING TV ON HIS PHONE]
SCHMIDT: Hey, where's Winston, MM?
NICK: Yeah, I think he's in his room, Schmidt.
SCHMIDT: (Sits down) Do you really think I'm top dog?
NICK: Yes
SCHMIDT: Do you think I'm head baller, sh*t caller?
NICK: Yes Schmidt, I feel that way.
SCHMIDT: (Moves next to Nick) You see that man? It's my new thumb ring. Hot choice is that. Little skull. It's so nectar.
NICK: Did you just make up nectar?
SCHMIDT: Nah, it's a volleyball term. What is Winston doing in there? He can't hang out in there, it's too small.
[ENTER JESS AND CECE]
NICK: What's up?
SCHMIDT: Yo, what up, Cec?
NICK: You alright?
JESS: I'm sorry, I didn't get the TV.
SCHMIDT: What happened?
CECE: Urgh, terrible roommates. I mean seriously, you guys told her to call Spencer? That is not your job, that is my job!
NICK: Alright, so what happened?
JESS: Urgh, he needed a ride to the airport.
NICK: What?!
JESS: For his new girlfriend.
NICK: Are you kidding me?!
SCHMIDT: Are you serious?
CECE: What? You didn't tell me that!
JESS: And, I'm supposed to pick her up next Sunday.
NICK: OMG Jess!
SCHMIDT: Wow.
JESS: What's wrong with me?
NICK: I figured it out. This guy is your kryptonite. You need to stand up and you need to fight him.
JESS: I want to fight him but I can't. I'm powerless.
NICK: Cause you're not ready to let him go. I think you know, deep down, once you get your stuff back, you know, it's over over.
CECE: I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, but, I agree with him.
JESS: No, you guys are wrong. I really, I really wanna move on.
NICK: Then you gotta fight.
JESS: Alright, I wanna fight.
NICK: Then get mad!
JESS: I wanna get mad!
NICK: (Stands up and pick up cushion from sofa) Alright, then do this. Pretend this is Spencer's face. Punch it. (Jess prepares herself for a showdown with the cushion) Get. (Punches cushion) Come on, do it again. (Punches a little harder) Alright, punch it like a man. (Punches a little harder.) Harder than that! (Punches harder)
CECE: Come on, Jess.
NICK: Come on Jess, get angry. (Punch) Good!
CECE: (Punch) Get angry. (Punch) Get real angry.
NICK: (Starts punch dancing) That's dancing. That's punch dancing. He broke your heart! He did terrible things to you, you hate him.
JESS: (Still punching) I'm mad!
NICK: Good.
CECE: There you go.
NICK: Good.
JESS: I'm bad!
NICK: You're ready, go get your stuff.
JESS: (Starts walking towards the door) I'm gonna go get my stuff!
NICK: Go get it.
SCHMIDT: Go on, Jess.
JESS: I'm really mad!
NICK: I'm proud of you.
JESS: I'm gonna go get it!
NICK: Go get your stuff.
JESS: I'm gonna face the facts! I'm gonna ask you guys, right now, to come with me. Seriously guys, cause I can't everything alone and I can't be alone.

SCHMIDT: Your hand's on my leg.
CECE: No, it really isn't.
SCHMIDT: Classic he said, she said.
CECE: Ok, Jess, just pull over right here. (Jess almost stops but at the last second steps on the gas again and drives off) Woah!
JESS: Ok, you know what, just one more sh*t.

NICK: Alright, this is the time, this is the time. Wow.
CECE: Woah!
JESS: Ok one more sh*t, one more sh*t, just one more, just one more.
SCHMIDT: (To Winston) You know I'm onto you.
WINSTON: What do you mean?
SCHMIDT: You told me that I'm top dog but secretly you think that you're top dog. Alright, now you are just trying to out top dog the top dog.
CECE: Jess, can you please take these doors off child lock so I can k*ll myself.
SCHMIDT: Men are working. Look things are different now man, you're not top dog anymore. I am.
WINSTON: Okay, you know what you are absolutely correct you are the top dog. (Puts hand up to head as if taking off imaginary crown) Here. (Puts it on Schmidt)
SCHMIDT: (Taking off the imaginary crown) What are you doing? There is no top dog crown. Are you trying to make me look stupid. Look man, this is about respect, I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
WINSTON: Yeah, much flyer, I respect you Schmidt.
SCHMIDT: No, you don't because if you had, you would have told me that the (song changes to a more calm love song) small room is the top dog room. (Jess begins to slow down)
JESS: (Singing along)
WINSTON: What? I own this song.
JESS: (Still singing) YOU GO AND SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST (Finally pulls up out side Spencer's house)
SCHMIDT: What's happening?
WINSTON: What's happening if that is a great song.
JESS: (Gets out of car and walks towards the house)
CECE: I'll be out here if you need me, Jess. (Jess rings the doorbell continuously until it opens)
SPENCER: Hi, Jess-jess.
NICK: That's the wizard? He's wearing a scrunchie.
WINSTON: It looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
CECE: Yeah, like he'd ever have a job.
SCHMIDT: Didn't you just kinda assume he'd have a handlebar moustache.
NICK: Come on Jess, just go in there and get that TV.
SPENCER: (Pulls Jess into a hug) I missed you Jess.
CECE: Don't hug him back... (Jess hugs him back) ALL IN CAR GROAN
SCHMIDT: Ugh. That's not healthy.
JESS: (Notices withered plants) I told you to water the plants! (Pulls away from hug)
SPENCER: Huh? Oh, you know that's not my thing. (Tries to hug her back but she pushes him away)
JESS: I told you to water the plants. (Pick up flowerpot and throws it onto the lawn, smashing) ARRRRGGGHHHH!
NICK: What is she doing?
ALL: OHHH!!
SCHMIDT: What a mess.
JESS: ARGGGHHHH! I'M GOING IN!! (Runs into house)

JESS: Yeah. Play on words. Jam. Boree. Jam!
NICK AND SCHMIDT: Jam!
SCHMIDT: We all made a lot of jam, Spence. You know how time consuming that can be? You need a jar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit; strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe...
NICK: No more fruit.
SPENCER: You live with these people Jess?! Seriously?! You can stay here until you can find a better place to live.
NICK: You know what, I don't like you stretch. I don't like anything about you. And I'm not afraid to...
JESS: (Touches Nicks shoulder, to Nick) I got this. (To Spencer) I've got a place to live, Spence. It's over. I spent six year trying to figure you out. All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair. I'm happy you cheated on me, thank you. Because if you hadn't, I would have ended up marrying you and then you would have hurt me all over again. (Sigh) And yeah, I was scared to start over, I didn't know what to do. And yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the internet. And yeah, stranger danger is real, but I love these guys, I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them. All of them!
GUYS: Just take it easy on the love stuff...
WINSTON: (Bends down to pick up a hat) Give her the shirt back, man. (Puts hat on)
SPENCER: What happens if I say no?
SCHMIDT: You know what happens? Schmidt happens! (Slaps Spencer)
SPENCER: Ow. What's on your hand?
SCHMIDT: Thumb ring, bitch! You got some Schmidt on your face!
CECE: (Walks out with some more of her stuff, including her bike)
SPENCER: You know what, fine, here, take it. (Takes off shirt)
CECE: (Walks by him) Keep the bell. (Chucks bell at him)
SPENCER: You know, I thought we were going to handle this like adults, Jess.
JESS: Yeah well, I though you were the love of my life, so... (sh*t of the guys watching her from in front of the car with her stuff) Suck it, Mr. Crabs! (Walks back to the car where they all pat her on the back)
[WINSTON AND SCHMIDT CARRYING SOME OF JESS' STUFF AND WALKING THROUGH THE BUILDING]
WINSTON: I do hate that guy.
SCHMIDT: (Shrugs shoulders) Whatevs, you know.
WINSTON: (Laughs) You know what? Maybe I didn't have respect for you before, because, if this is what respecting you feels like, this is definitely not how I felt. (Stops in Jess' room and start putting stuff down)
SCHMIDT: So you recognize? Represent, what.
WINSTON: Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest, I've been messing with you, but it's just that I wanted my old room back. You know, you're right, I've been away a long time and things have changed around here so I kind of got to get used to that. Keep the big room.
SCHMIDT: So now you're just deep dogging me, man. I'm not scared of your mind games, I'm taking the small room, Winston.
WINSTON: Schmidt, that's not what I mean...
SCHMIDT: No no no no no. Why don't you listen to me. You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home. I'm not falling for it. What do you take me for? Some kind of idiot?
WINSTON: (Behind Schmidt's back - a  yeah! action.)
EVERYONE IS IN THE LIVING ROOM, NICK IS TRYING TO TAPE UP THE TV
JESS: I can't believe I got all my stuff back.
NICK: You did, but most of it's broken.
JESS: Yeah it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine.
NICK: Yeah, but it's broken. (TV makes a beep sound) Hey! Look at that.
JESS: Oh my God.
NICK: I think it's working.
JESS: Oh my God!
NICK: We got a TV again. (High fives her)
JESS: It's a TV and it's working.
NICK: Hey, we got the TV back. (Sits down with Jess) Alright. (Winston comes and sits down)
JESS: You guys are awesome. I'm gonna make you so much jam.
NICK: Please don't. (Schmidt sits down)
JESS: We're gonna have a jam sess.
NICK: Absolutely not. (TV falls to the side and they all turn their heads) Okay, what are we watching?
JESS: I have some DVDs. Um, Adventures of Babysitting, Prancer, Noosies, Curly Sue.
WINSTON: I'm going out. (All the guys get up)
JESS: Wait, where are you guys going? These are heart-warming films.
SCHMIDT: (Comes running back in) Curly Sue, let's do this.
JESS: Alright, lemme go get it.
END
SCENE: The apartment, a close up of Jess, sat on a sofa facing Nick, Schmidt and Coach.
JESS: So, you know in horror movies when the girl's like "Oh my god, there's something in the basement. Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on in the dark", and you're like "what is your problem? Call the police", and she's like "okay" but it's too late because she's already getting m*rder. Well, er, my story's kind of like that.
FLASHBACK - "Two Weeks Ago" - Jess is in a taxi, on the phone to Cece, her best friend.
JESS: It's a surprise for Spencer. I'm just gonna walk in and I'm gonna drop my coat on the ground. He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold, and he's helping me put myself through college.
CECE: He didn't say the college part, did he?
JESS: Um, no, I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character.
CECE: Really? What's your stripper name?
JESS: Uh... Rebecca Johnson?
CECE: Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson?
JESS: Boobies Johnson. Two-boobs Johnson.
CECE: Look at you, in the back of a cab, totally naked. I am so proud of you.
SCENE: Spencer's House - Jess enters through the front door, wearing nothing but a coat.
JESS: Hellooo? I came home early.
SPENCER: (Steps out of a room, surprised, wearing nothing but his underwear.) Jess. What-
JESS: Who's Jess? You're talking to...Tiger Boobs. (Jess takes off her coat and drops it on the ground, now completely naked.)
SPENCER: Oh...
JESS: (Jess picks up a pillow, covers herself and starts dancing seductively a bit and sings a little stripper tune.) (Singing) I'm doing sexy things (starts trotting to the side) with the pillow.
SPENCER: This-
JESS: (While shaking a plant, singing) I''m doing sexy stuff to the plant right here... (The plant falls over, making a mess.)
SPENCER: Woah, okay.
JESS: (Singing) I'll pick that up later.
JESS: (Turns around, singing) Who's that girl? (Louder) Who's that girl? (Spins back around) It's Jess!
(Another girl stands by Spencer in her underwear)
SPENCER: Um...
(Jess stands and stares in absolute shock.)
Close up of a ribbon dropping to the floor that was previously covering Jess' lady parts.
Flashback End.
SCENE: Back in the apartment.
JESS: So, that happened. That's why I need a new apartment. I'm sorry, what was the question again?
(We now see Nick, Schmidt and Coach sat opposite Jess on the other sofa. They're all staring at her, speechless.)
NICK: Do you have any pets?
OPENING CREDITS
SCENE: Everyone remains where they were before the opening credit.
JESS: You know what's funny? When I saw your ad on Craigslist, I thought you were women.
SCHMIDT: (Nick, Schmidt and Coach laugh and joke a bit, Schmidt suddenly turns serious) Why would you think that? That's crazy. I mean, what-
NICK: Schmidt wrote the ad.
JESS: Oh. I guess it was something about the words you used. It was like, er, like "sun-soaked" and "beigey".
NICK: (Nick and Coach laugh more, Schmidt takes off his top) What are you doing?
COACH: Wow.
SCHMIDT: What about these? These look beigey to you?
NICK: I'm sorry.
COACH: I'm his trainer so, er, it's kind of the house that coach built right here. (Coach slaps Schmidt's abs and rubs them a bit)
NICK: What are we looking at here? That's baby smooth.
SCHMIDT: This is LLS. Ladies Love Schmidt.
COACH: What!? What did you just say? Go put a dollar in the jar right now. (There is a jar sat on a table with the label "DOUCHEBAG JAR")
SCHMIDT: Are you serious?
COACH: Yeah! Now.
SCHMIDT: Dammit. (He gets up and walks out of sh*t, putting a dollar in the douchebag jar on his way)
NICK: LLS, what is wrong with you?
JESS: (Now standing) This place is beautiful. It gets so much light. Spencer hated light. It's hard to say his name.
SCHMIDT: It's okay. Nick knows. He got dumped.
NICK: (Sniggering) Dumped. Yeah, I got dumped.
FLASHBACK - A restaurant, Nick and his ex-girlfriend, Caroline are sat at a table.
NICK: (With hands over his hears, shouting over Caroline) I can't hear you, that means we're not breaking up! We can't break up if I can't hear you! No! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!
CAROLINE: (While Nick is shouting) I need a break. Yes, we're breaking up. I'm breaking up with you. I need some time away-
END FLASHBACK - Back in the apartment
NICK: Yeah, I got dumped. She dumped. And I'm over it. Okay, it was six months ago, guys. Get past it. I don't even know why we're still talking about it. Why's everybody looking at me? (He puts his head in his hands. Suddenly Nick, Schmidt and Coach approach Jess, who is in the kitchen now, they stand on the opposite side of a counter)
JESS: You know what, I want to live here.
NICK: Actually, I still have some questions. I mean, like, no offence but we barely know ya.
JESS: Yeah, okay, yeah. So, um, full disclosure, I'm kind of emotional right now 'cause of the break-up so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least 6 or 7 times... a day.
(Coach shakes his head slightly, looks and is disgusted)
JESS: Um, I'm a teacher so I bring home a lot of popsicle sticks, stuff like that. Also, I like to sing to myself - a lot. (Singing) A lot... I'm tired of living with my friend. She's a model. All her friends are models.
SCHMIDT: (Excited) Er, how soon can you move in?
NICK: Actually, Schmidt, slow down.
COACH: Not happening.
SCHMIDT: Okay, um, can you give us a second? I've just gotta.. (Thumping his chest) I gotta talk to my boys.
NICK: "My boys" is not a thing in here.
SCHMIDT: My bros.
NICK: Okay, Douchebag Jar.
SCHMIDT: Come on, you're my bros.
TIME JUMP - The apartment - Nick, Schmidt and Coach are in the bathroom talking.
SCHMIDT: I'm gonna say yes. Her friends are models. Okay, you guys? Models.
COACH: I say no. I need to be able to come home from work, sit on my couch, and let my beans out. Let 'em breathe.
SCHMIDT: Nick, it's all you, buddy.
NICK: Well, first, let me say I think you guys make some really interesting points. Points that I respect, but I will say this. I have lived with a woman, Caroline, as you guys know, and so I know that there are pros and I know that there are real cons, guys.
COACH: Nick, you're weak!
NICK: Okay, Pros: they smell nice. Cons: every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why. They'll ruin your life if you let 'em, they'll break down your will to live. Pros: they're really good at folding.
COACH: Make a decision!
NICK: I'm sorry, you know what? But, like, another pro, like when you-
SCHMIDT: Don't do it, put it down.
Coach: Don't.
NICK: I got it. (Puts a hood on and slowly pulls it over his face)
SCHMIDT: Don't hood me. Please don't hood me. Okay.
NICK: I know what I'm talking about.
COACH: We pushed him too hard.
SCHMIDT: We did push him too hard. How about this? Executive decision, she's in.
JESS: (Out of sh*t) Yay, I'm in! (Schmidt walks over and opens the bathroom door. Jess is stood there.)
JESS: You are not gonna regret this.
TIME JUMP - The apartment - Jess sits alone on the floor watching Dirty Dancing, crying her eyes out, she is surrounded by used tissues and wrappers. Nick, Schmidt and Coach stare from a difference.
NICK: What have you done, Schmidt?  (Coach stares at Schmidt, who shrugs like whaaat?)
SCENE: The apartment - Jess lies on a sofa watching Dirty Dancing, it's still quite messy around her, she's on the phone to her mother.
JESS: I gotta go, mom. No, I'm not watching Dirty Dancing. (Nick enters.)
JESS: No, I don't think so. (To Nick) Hey, are you gonna m*rder me 'cause you're a stranger I met on the internet?
NICK: Yes, I am.
JESS: He says no.
(Schmidt and Coach enter, they've been working out.)
JESS: No, look, I gotta go, okay? Alright, love you. Bye.
SCHMIDT: So the Wild West party's on Saturday. I'm trying to get us in but you may need to call Caroline.
NICK: (Quickly) I'm not calling Caroline.
SCHMIDT: Hear me out.
(Nick shushes Schmidt and puts his hand on Schmidt's mouth.)
JESS: (Singing along with Dirty Dancing) ... had the time of my life.
NICK: (Pointing at Jess) We are in this situation because of you.
JESS: (Jess begins punching the sofa/pillows in the background) I hate your face, Spencer, I love you!
NICK: It has been a week of this madness. I am going crazy, Schmidt, I can't take it.
COACH: You know what? I got this. (He walks over to Jess and sits on the coffee table opposite her)
JESS: Hi, Coach.
COACH: (Firmly) Stop it. Stop!
(Jess starts wailing even louder than before)
COACH: Schmidt!
SCHMIDT: Okay. Alright. I got us into this, I'm gonna get us out. Jess, I'm gonna take the remote. (TV turning off sound) Alright. Alright, hey, Jess. (Jess just points at the TV) How you doing? (Jess shrugs like 'put the tv back on')  You look fantastic. Listen, what if you came out with us tonight? You know after work. You know, we'll fix you up, we'll take you out. We'll get you a rebound.
JESS: A rebound?
SCHMIDT: Yeah.
JESS: I don't know if I'm ready.
SCHMIDT: You're totally ready for it, I'll take you through the whole thing. You know, I'll be like your guide!
JESS: Like Gandalf through Middle-earth?
SCHMIDT: Probably not like...okay, first of all, let's take the Lord of the Rings references, let's put 'em in a deep, dark cave, okay, where no one's gonna find them, ever.
JESS: Except Smeagol, (whispering) he lives in a cave.
SCHMIDT: You know what, Jess? Come on. Let's just take the head off the couch. Come on. Sit up, girl. (Jess sits up straight) Look at that, doesn't that feel good? There we go.
JESS: I think that sounds nice. (Singing) She's going out to find a rebound. Who's that girl? It's Jess!
NICK: Wait, did you just make up a theme song for yourself?
SCHMIDT: (After some hesitation) I'm a...I'm a fix it.
SCENE: Schmidt dressed in a suit is chasing Nick down the corridor of the apartment.
NICK: I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party. (Nick is walking down the corridor with a towel over his shoulder Schmidt following behind.)
SCHMIDT: This party is everything to me, please Nick. We go every year, you have no idea what I'm going through at work.
FLASHBACK - Schmidt in a meeting room, addressing a table of women.
SCHMIDT: (Shouting over the noise of protesting women) I am just trying to do my work. I'm just trying to do a good job, here.
WOMAN: Nice tie, can I borrow a tampon? (Teasingly, laughter in the background.)
FLASHBACK END - Schmidt shudders at the memory. Nick and Schmidt are in the bathroom, whilst Jess is in the shower.
NICK: Schmidt, I'm not calling her.
SCHMIDT: Listen to me, knowing every year that I will be going to the Waa Waa West Charity Auction for poverty reminds me that I'm still a man, and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the Chiriquí nation, which is not r*cist because it is for a good cause.
JESS: (From inside the shower) Somebody's in here.
SCHMIDT: We're leaving in ten minutes, did you shave your legs?
JESS: I will now.
SCHMIDT: Front and backs?
JESS: Yes.
SCHMIDT: Thank you.
NICK: (Quietly) Ok, I'm gonna k*ll myself now.
SCHMIDT: Just call Caroline, you call her all the time when you're drunk.
NICK: (Feigning innocence) I don't know to what you are referring.
FLASHBACK - A drunk Nick is on the sofa with a beer on the phone, leaving a drunken voicemail on her            phone
NICK: (In a very bad British accent, swigging beer) Hello, Caroline. I still love you, so much. (Starts to sob) So, much. (Puts his head in his hands.)
FLASHBACK END - In the bathroom
NICK: I'm not calling her.
JESS: (Pulls back shower curtain and gets out, wearing a bright pink swimsuit) Schmidt, I know you really want to go to this party, but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat, then maybe if you're super lucky, you find a girl who'll motorboat you right back.
NICK: (Smirking) I don't think she knows what motorboating is.
SCENE: Jess's bedroom - with the door open. Jess is wearing a blue robe, whilst staring at her clothe-              scattered bed, deciding what to wear.
SCHMIDT: (From another room) Jess, we are leaving in five.
COACH: (Walks in to the room with a basketball) Hey.
JESS: (Holding a curling iron in her hair, turns around) Hey Coach, wha--
COACH: (Smashes an ornament with his basketball) Sorry. Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous...
FLASHBACK - Coach in a gym, with a women who is on an exercise bike, she is upset because he is                shouting at her.
COACH: SPIN WOMAN, SPIN! AHHHHHHH!
WOMAN: I'm spinning! You are so mean! (Sobbing)
COACH: I'M NOT MEAN, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU! I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!
FLASHBACK END - Back in Jess's room
COACH: So I was wondering if you could, uh, help me out with that.
JESS: Sure, sure. Absolutely. (Sits down on the edge of her bed) Um, well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about, you know, like, use me for practice.
COACH: Alright, uh, um, (clears throat) shopping, is that fun for you guys?
JESS: Yeah, shopping's fun. Uh, the other day I bought a pair of jeggings, they look like jeans but they're really leggings.
COACH: Uh, uh, you-, I-. Who cares!? Sorry.
JESS: (Nods) Uhm, good job. Uh, a couple of things you could work on, uh 1. Lowering your voice.
COACH: Right on.
JESS: Uhm, 2. Listening. (Her hair begins to smoke) 3. Rage. (Smokes a bit more.)
COACH: Absolutely.
JESS: Uhm, 4.--
COACH: Your hair is on f*re. (She frowns at him and then glances to the side.)
SCENE: In the bar, where Nick works as a bartender. He is serving the g*ng drink whilst they are at a                           table.
NICK: Beers, and a rose.
JESS: Pink wines makes me, slutty. (A 'cute' guy walks by)
JESS: Woah, cute guy alert. (does silly stuff with her glasses whilst making noises whilst Schmidt shakes his head and Coach and Nick glance at each other)
SCHMIDT: Okay, Jess, gametime. Let's do this. If you wanna forget about Spencer (she nods) you're gonna have to do some very very bad things, (points) with that man, right over there.
JESS: (glances to look at the man) How bad?
SCHMIDT: Real bad, Jess. Real bad.
JESS: Like a, make-out sess, no tops?
SCHMIDT: (Losing the will) Okay, this is what- this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile. (she smiles a little creepily) But, you're not gonna smile like that. (Pulls a weird kind of rabbit/chipmunk smile) That looks like a, hungry badger. Pulls the same face but tries to smile as well)
COACH: Stop that.
JESS: Okay, I got this, I got this.
SCHMIDT: You got this. You got it. Just go make it out.
COACH: Get 'em up! Ride 'em out! Go do it. Ride 'em out! Huhah! (they both stand watching as she walks up to the man)
JESS: (Walks up to the side of him, pulls a pose with her hands on her hips and leans over) Hey, sailor. (He glances at her, and then looks back away)
COACH: Oh. Alright.
SCHMIDT: Alright.
COACH: That's okay. Maybe he didn't hear that.
SCHMIDT: You can come back from that.
COACH: Maybe he didn't hear that.
SCHMIDT: It's all good.
BENJAMIN: (Noticing it was Schmidt) HOLY SCHMIDT, IT'S SCHMIDT! (Walks towards Schmidt)
SCHMIDT: Oh, it is all about the Benjamin! Wassup?! (Share a man hug) Alright, P-Funk, what's up dude? This is Coach.
BENJAMIN: What's up Coach? (Falters when Coach doesn't reply) You like parties?
COACH: Don't talk to me. (Walks away)
BENJAMIN: Yeah, okay.
SCHMIDT: You know who likes to party hard, right?
BENJAMIN: Yeah, so you coming on Saturday, I here there's gonna be some fine ladies there?
SCHMIDT: Uh, maybe, yeah. I heard it's not gonna be that good this year. No?
BENJAMIN: Are you not on the list?
SCHMIDT: Man, I'm on the list, you know that.
BENJAMIN: Ohhh. That sucks man. Keep your head up, alright?
SCHMIDT: Alright, player. Do your thing man, it was good seeing you. Alright, man, P-Funk, always. (Walks over to the bar where, Coach, Nick and Jess are) Nick, please.
NICK: (Leaning over the bar) Why are you friends with those guys?
SCHMIDT: Nick, please get me in the party, I'm begging you, please.
NICK: No, I'm not calling Caroline.
SCHMIDT: Do you know what a cute cowboy I am? Do you have any idea? (Coach gets up and leaves)
SCENE: At the bar, Jess is sitting, eating a meal with a glass of wine, talking to Nick who is working at the         bar.
JESS: Well, I guess I can't hide my crazy.
NICK: I don't think you're trying that hard.
JESS: Well, I've never been, great at this stuff, so... (bites on a celery stick)
FLASHBACK - At someone's home, young Jess is sitting on a chair playing her guitar and singing to a small      group of people at a party.
JESS: (Singing) What if God was one of us?
BOY: God, make it stop! (Puts his hands over his ears)
JESS: (Singing) Just a slob like one of us?
END OF FLASHBACK - At the bar, with Nick and Jess
JESS: Looks at us, couple of losers, we both got dumped, jeesh.
NICK: (Shaking his head) I'm fine. Six months ago so...
JESS: Do you know why she dumped you? I mean she must've hurt you pretty bad..
NICK: No, no, it made no difference to me, I just wanted to set her trash cans on f*re.
JESS: So are you always just like wondering, like, what was it, was there something I could've done differently? (he shakes his head) Do you know what happens to people who keep it all inside? They get old, and they get sad and they get weird and then you're the old man yelling at the kids who are running across your yard and you're telling them 'Don't run across my yard, my life's full of regret'. You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.
NICK: Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess, and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.
JESS: Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.
NICK: No, I was being mean, I'm not gonna do that, Jess.
JESS: Why not?! It's fun!
NICK: Because I have a penis, Jess.
JESS: (Singing in an old man's voice) My name is Nick, I have a penis and I'm not gonna let any feelings out.
NICK: (Leaning forward) Okay Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.
JESS: Yeah, I know.
PETER: (P-FUNK) Hey, I'm Peter. What are you drinking?
JESS: Oh, I'll have another pink wine. (Nick begins to walk away, taking out his phone)
PETER: I like your glasses,
JESS: They help me see.
SCENE: At a table, Jess and Peter are chatting and laughing, being observed by Schmidt and Coach.
COACH: She's doing alright.
BENJAMIN: (Walking up to Schmidt and Coach) Schmidt stain! Hey man. I was thinking that it's probably best that you don't come to the party, that means more breast for me. (Laughs)
SCHMIDT: (Standing up) You better step down son, you're taking this whole thing too far. Hold me back Coach, I'm seri-. Hold me back. Hold me back! Coach, would you please hold me back.
NICK: (Walking up to him from the other side of the bar) Schmidt, we're going to the party, relax.
BENJAMIN: Nice, see you there Schmidtty! (Walks away)
SCHMIDT: Ah, totally, Broseph.
NICK: Yeah I texted Caroline.
COACH: You text Caroline?
NICK: (Nods) It's no big deal, it's behind me. It's in the past so..
SCHMIDT: Thank you, I love you, (hugs him) very, very much.
NICK: Yeah...Did you just kiss my arm a little?
SCHMIDT: Yeah I did, it felt right.
PETER: (Walking with Jess) So I'll see you tomorrow, sailor. (Walks away)
JESS: Yeah, cool. I'll call--, cool.
NICK: So what's happening tomorrow, sailor?
JESS: You know what, you guys were totally right. I talked in short sentences, I didn't sing, I laughed, I smiled, I said I needed rebound sex and it totally worked. He asked me out. Dinner, with food. Oooh oooh.
SCHMIDT: I'm so proud of you. (Hugs her)
COACH: You got it girl.
SCHMIDT: You did good.
COACH: You got it down. (High fives her)
JESS: (With her hands in the air) It's Jess, she's on (sings) fiiiirrreee! (Backs away at the same time, starts dancing and all the guys groan because as she turns, they notice her top is tucked in her panties)
COACH: Big ass panties.
NICK: Alright, shall we tell her?
SCHMIDT: I'll think we'll let her have her moment.
SCENE: At the apartment, Cece is sitting on the couch in a low cut dress, with all the guys staring at her,           whilst she waits for Jess.
CECE: Do the shoes fit , Jess?
JESS: (Hears a thump) I'm okay!
COACH: What are you, a model or something?
CECE: Yeah. Yes. Mostly print right now... so.
SCHMIDT: What is it? Cece? Cecelia? Chechelia? Tell me what are your hopes and dreams? Are you warm? I'm a little, huh, I'm a little warm right now. (Begins to take off his t-shirt)
NICK: Don't, Schmidt.
COACH: All right.
SCHMIDT: (Finishes taking off his shirt) Oh yeah. There it is. (Breathes deeply an flexes)
CECE: (Unfazed) Please put your shirt back on. Please don't make me laugh at you.
SCHMIDT: Can I h*t you up with some tea? A little herb tea? Ahhh. Oh my God. How good is that, for real, whaat? A little Peaman tea? Yum, right? Hot, sweet, a little teabag action. And I wasn't, I wasn't talking about...
NICK: (Reaching over to grab the douchebag jar) There it is. Douchebag.
CECE: Listen to me you guys, Jess is by far the best person that I know, so if you guys let anything happen to her, I'm gonna come here, and crazy m*rder you.
SCHMIDT: I'm gonna be honest with you. I did not hear a word you just said 'cause I can kinda see your party hats right now.
NICK: (Reaching over for the jar again) Here we go.
CECE: Jess! (Gets up and walks off)
NICK: (Schmidt deposits another dollar into the douchebag jar) Why are you talking like this?
SCENE: Opening Jess' door, Cece sees Jess, sprawled on the floor.
JESS: I fell off my heels.
CECE: Okay. Alright. No. Come on. (Kneels to pull Jess up) Get up.
JESS: Oh, what am I doing? I can't go on a date, what if it's horrible, what if I have nothing to talk about?
CECE: Then you go to the bathroom and you call me and you tell me all about it.
JESS: Maybe I just shouldn't go.
CECE: Babe, you got hurt, that doesn't mean you stop trying. Okay?
JESS: (Mumbles something and nods)
CECE: Okay. Let's go, come on. (Both stand up and look at what she's wearing) You gotta take off those overalls.
JESS: I was going for, like a, like a hot farmer's daughter kinda thing, you know like. (Puts on a voice) Oh, I'm to go milk my cows, with my bucket.
CECE: Take 'em off.
JESS: Okay, what am I going to wear?
SCENE: All the guys are sitting doing things when Cece walks out in Jess's overalls with a proud smile on her face. Nick looks up and Cece motions for Jess to appear.
COACH: (Jess walks out and gets Coach and Schmidt's attention.) Wow!
JESS: (Nick smiles, Jess smiles) Thanks, Coach. (Then she starts doing a rave dance with rave music.)
SCHMIDT: And then she does that.
JESS: I'm gonna text him, tell him I'm heading over.
NICK: Wait, have you been texting him?
JESS: Yeah, is that bad?
NICK: (Pauses and shakes his head) No. (Smiles slightly) It's nice. Have a good night.
JESS: This gonna be great.
SCENE: At a very A-List club, there is really loud music and a large que of people outside, waiting to get in.
SCHMIDT: Coach, you don't look anything like an Indian.
COACH: Look man, I got your back, you gotta have mine too.
NICK: Coach, I got your back.
COACH: No, Nick. I wanna hear it from him.
SCHMIDT: Coach, what sort of Indian wears bike shorts.
NICK: S'cuse me, is er, Caroline, I'm looking for Caroline, we're supposed to be on some list?
CAROLINE: Hey, Nick. (Waves)
NICK: Sorry, I'm wearing this stupid thing. Schmidt made me do it. Thank you so much for getting us in.
CAROLINE: Yeah, no problem. Um, maybe to pay me back you can stop prank calling me.
NICK: What?
CAROLINE: Uh, (puts on some kind of accent pretending to be Nick's voicemail) Hello Caroline, I still loves you I do.
NICK: Yeah, you gotta figure that out, some crazy person's calling you. You look nice, it's good to see you.
CAROLINE: Um, I think I'm almost finished out here if you, do you wanna go, grab a drink?
NICK: Yeah.
CAROLINE: Yeah?
NICK: Sure, yeah let's, you and I just get a drink.
CAROLINE: Let's get a drink.
NICK: Let's be normal about it.
CAROLINE: Okay.
NICK: Actually, hold on, I'm sorry. I just, I have to ask you something so that, one day, I'm not an old man filled with regret, but why did you dump me?
CAROLINE: Um, do, okay, are we doing this here, like now?
NICK: (Sighs) Yeah, why did you dump me?
CAROLINE: Um. Honestly I, I didn't even realize that you cared about me until we broke up.
NICK: Okay. Let's get that drink.
BENJAMIN: (In a western accent) Get along little doggy. Well howdy there, muchachos.
NICK: (Walking over notices Peter) Hey, where's Jess?
PETER: Oh, dude, she texted me like seven times. Like long ones. I just wanna hook up.
NICK: So's she waiting for you to show up, or did you call her?
PETER: Yeah, that's what I did, I called her. (Laughs with Benjamin)
BENJAMIN: See you inside, Schmidt.
CAROLINE: Nick, you wanna get that drink?
NICK: No, I gotta go help a friend, Caroline. (Starts walking away with Coach.)
SCHMIDT: (Holding up his hands in front of them) Nonononononono, guys, this is the party of the year, guys this is our night, this is our night!
COACH: (They keep walking) I'm going with Nick, man, you coming?
SCHMIDT: I thought you guys were my boys?
NICK: You're boys is not a thing, Schmidt, stop. (starts running) We're coming Jess!
SCHMIDT: (Stands there mulling it over. Sees a 'hot' Indian dressed girl waving and jumping up and down, with big boobs. Bites his knuckle, thinking about it) Uhh. (runs after them)
SCENE: In the restaurant, Jess is waiting to meet Peter for her date, a waitress approaches.
JESS: Do you have anything, else that is, free, but also has bread in it, because the, the like good bread I ate and uh, all that's left is a, it's like a, it's kind of like a health bread?
WAITRESS: I'm sorry. We're gonna have to ask you to give up the table.
JESS: Um, can I please just stay, just a little bit longer?
NICK: WE'RE HERE! (Running in with the guys) Yup, we're here, Jess! We're here.
SCHMIDT: We're here for the date, the date thing.
WAITRESS: (Shocked) You're all here, for the date?
NICK: Yeah we are. We're her boyfriends. We are reversed mormons, one man just isn't enough for her.
WAITRESS: Ohhkay. (Walks away)
NICK: Hey, Jess, that guys was a jerk, he's a clown.
JESS: (Getting all emotional) You guys missed your party to come here and, to see me?
NICK: Yeah, we uh, we care about you. We like you.
JESS:That's so nice. (Sniffles)
COACH: What is that?
NICK: Don't start crying.
COACH: Come on.
JESS: (Crying) It's cool. It's very very cool.
NICK: Come on, Jess, come on.
COACH: Stop it!
NICK: Coach, shut up. It's okay, hey, don't cry. (Singing, badly) For I've had the time of my life. (Jess looks up)
COACH: What is he doing?
NICK: And I've never felt this way before. Yes it's true. Na na na na na, and it's (hits Coach so he starts to sing/mumble) something something something, something something.
COACH: There's bears, in my house and it goes like this.
NICK: (Over Coach) And it's the something that you really really have.
SCHMIDT: I'm not uh, I'm not doing any of this. (Nick hits him and he starts singing whilst the others mumble in the background) Just remember, you're the one thing, I can't get enough of.
(They stop briefly and she laughs, they keep mumble singing random words getting louder, and then sing the chorus really badly.)
All of them, including Jess: I've had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you.
NICK: What time is it!!??
ALL OF THEM: I've had the time of my life-
WAITRESS: [Walks up to them] Hey, you have to leave now, all of you!
(They walk out singing really loudly, Jess grinning from ear to ear)
SCENE: The g*ng is on the sofa, watching the end of Dirty Dancing.
NICK: You're right Jess, this movie's pretty good.
JESS: Seriously, thank you guys for tonight, that was really cool.
SCHMIDT: Listen Jess, I know you've had a rough go with it, I just want you to know, that, I mean for me at least, no matter what, I would still totally do you.
JESS: Aww, that's so sweet.
SCHMIDT: Yeah, absolutely.
JESS: Jar!
SCHMIDT: Yeah.
NICK: Yeah, jar.
END
And so, beautiful monkey cr*cker.
Monkey cr*cker boyfriend.
In Russia, we would strap you to goat - and see if you live.
- (chuckles)
And if you don't live, we eat the goat.
May you die together.
- (cheering)
- Well, that was wonderful.
- Did someone ask her to speak?
- CECE: Okay.
Up next, Nick's two best men: my husband and Winston Bishop.
- (cheering)
- SCHMIDT: Okay.
Oh, this is gonna be trouble.
Good.
Okay, so, uh, Nick and Jess asked the two of us to make a toast - the night before their wedding.
- But Schmidty and Winnie don't roll like that.
- Uh-oh.
- So why toast BOTH: When we can roast?
This is about to be really funny.
Okay, let's start with Nick.
Now, I don't want to say Nick here is a lazy piece of human garbage with a flat ass and the writing talents - of a brain-d*ad alcoholic.
- (laughs)
Because why state the obvious?
(Schmidt and Winston laughing)
Oh, my God.
- Oh.
- But in a real way, Nick sucks as a person, y'all.
- SCHMIDT: That's right.
- WINSTON: He really does.
But more importantly, his writing - also sucks!
- (laughs)
You know what they say: you put a thousand monkeys in front of a thousand typewriters One of them will be Nick, and he'll probably be writing The Pepperwood Chronicles.
(laughs)
That's a dumb-ass book.
Maybe this is our fault.
We threw this wedding together so fast.
And you did tell 'em to go hard.
I did actually tell them to go "hawd" and to not get "scurred," so th-that's where the confusion might be.
- And that brings us to Jess.
- Okay.
Beautiful, big-eyed Jess who could have had any man she wanted in the whole wide world.
- And still can.
- And still can.
- She still can.
- Run!
- WINSTON: Get your ass out.
- SCHMIDT: Run!
- He ain't no good.
- Do you think this is funny?
- No.
- He's gonna drag you down!
- That's a loser!
Run!
- Yep.
And he's a piece of doo-doo on top of it he won't pleasure you, just himself.
Do I really have to sleep at Schmidt's house tonight?
- He wants to do facials.
- SCHMIDT: Run!
I feel like that's not what I think it means, but I still don't want to do it.
Well, it is tradition to sleep apart the night before the wedding.
So, what does, uh, tradition say about hand stuff?
I'll have to check the book.
- Okay.
- WINSTON: That's Nick Miller.
- What book?
- SCHMIDT: Thank you.
- Okay.
(laughs)
- Right there.
- For real, though.
- Okay.
Have a lovely evening, you guys.
Okay.
- That was good, right?
- Yep.
- God, Mom!
- I wasn't touching it.
You shouldn't have slept together the night before your wedding.
It is bad luck.
- Oh.
- Mom, that's just a stupid superstition.
Oh, it is so not.
Your Uncle Elmer slept with your Aunt Jeanie the night before their wedding.
And they've been married 40 years.
But he's gay.
You're playing with f*re.
- This marriage could be cursed.
- Well, if the curse means spending the rest of my life with the woman I love, then I say - bring it on.
- Oh, grow up.
- I love you.
- Love you, too.
- Also, your Wang is out.
- It is?
(sighs)
JESS: I'm getting married In the morning Even though it's later in the day Am I nervous?
Maybe Damn, I forgot to invite Sadie Who knew my Uncle Elmer was gay?
Hey, Jess, I'm gonna take Mario for a little walk.
I'll see you on the other side of the aisle.
I'd ask you for a kiss, but I don't want to mess with the curse.
Well, that curse can kiss my ass, and you can kiss my face.
That's very funny, but the swearing will end when we're married.
- All right.
Love you.
- Love you.
Have fun.
(screams)
(toy squeaks)
Honey, you are as beautiful as the day you slid out of me.
No one is gonna be able to take their eyes off you.
You're a vision.
Really?
- I don't look like a pirate bride?
- No.
- No way.
- Never.
Mm-mm.
Why are we lying to her?
Not now, Ruth.
(clears throat)
Idea.
Once I am finished with your hair, no one's gonna notice anyway, okay?
Oh!
Nothing that covers my shoulders.
I want to make sure I leave room for the parrot.
It's the curse.
I told you.
She slipped in the shower and scratched her cornea on a dog toy.
That could happen to anyone.
ALY: Hey.
People on one side of the aisle won't even notice.
- Oh.
- Is it that bad?
I just want to check it out.
- It's fine oh.
- Can I look at it?
Oh, God, I look like a prost*tute from an Old West movie that everybody calls Winks.
Oh, my gosh, I actually arrested a prost*tute named Winks once.
Was she pretty?
She was a good person, but she had her demons, like we all do.
We don't need to talk about Winks.
Ah Excuse me.
Mom, what if it is the curse?
What if I cursed my future with Nick?
What if it's all downhill from here?
It's not real, okay, do not let that get into your head.
- Sweetheart, this wedding is a wash.
- Oh, my God.
You'll get it right the next time.
- Joan - Cece.
(indistinct conversations)
NICK: Tran!
Look at you.
You look so good, you heartthrob.
Hey, did you ever think Jess was gonna want to marry me?
You did?
Ah, see, I didn't see that.
I just feel like the luckiest guy in the whole world.
That's a very sweet thing to say.
Hey, I'm feeling a little bit antsy.
What's a groom supposed to do on his wedding day?
I said day, not night, you little pervert.
(laughing): I know what to do in the night.
Oh, my publisher just showed up.
I want to see what he thinks about my new book.
I'm not gonna give him your poems.
I'm not gonna do it.
I gave you my opinion on 'em.
There was some r*cist stuff in there that I didn't dig, and I don't want my name associated.
I'll give him your poems.
(laughing)
There he is, father of the bride.
I've been told to keep you to three drinks, sir.
Very cute.
Almost as cute as the toast that you gave last night.
Let me ask you something as a fan.
When you rhymed Nick's name with a certain body part, how did you come up with that?
I mean, because, come on, brilliant.
Thank you very much for saying that, it means He's being sarcastic.
Oh, so now you can read the room.
What the hell are you talking about?
We k*lled it last night.
Yeah, I explained every joke
- right after I told it.
- Yeah.
You stunk, like a a big wheel of Limburger cheese.
Now, that's comedy.
Stay away from me.
Nick, I gotta tell you, Chicago Hobo is
- some of your best writing.
- You really liked it?
- Oh, I loved it.
- What a relief.
I had no idea you had such a difficult childhood.
I mean, you've seen a lot of d*ad dogs.
- 313.
- Ah.
- So, when are we publishing this?
- Oh, no, no, we're not.
Uh, it's too dark for the tween market.
I-I thought you said you re you really l-liked We can sign you up for three more Pepperwoods.
I feel like I'm done with Pepperwood.
That's a great, that's great, that's great.
- See, because he's Jewish
- Okay, yum, yum.
Who's that bear over there?
Don't answer.
(wings flapping)
(sighs)
The curse?
No.
- Oh - Hey, I'm just, uh, looking for hairspray.
What is going on with you?
Nothing.
Where's Ruth?
Oh, she's busy guarding the bridal suite.
No boys allowed.
Get him, Mario!
(whines)
You sure you're okay?
Because you seem to be in some pain back there, like you were in, I don't know, labor.
What?
No, my baby loves being in here.
You don't even know.
- All right.
- (groans)
I'm fine.
Get out of here.
- All right.
- See ya.
(Aly groans loudly)
JOAN: Jess, honey, it's happening.
- What is?
- The curse!
How often do you check your mail?
Mom, you know your girl's paperless.
- You're being evicted.
- What?!
This is from the new management company.
I have to move out in 30 days.
Oh, no.
Everything's going wrong.
You were right.
I cursed us.
- This is a disaster!
What do I do?
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What do I do?
Mom!
- Shh, shh, shh.
Sweetheart, I know just want you need.
How about you try to relax with a little of the cheeba
- from Aunt Reeba?
- What?
- (whispering): Marijuana.
- It's my wedding day!
What?
Did you bring that on the plane?
- Yes.
- Mom!
Really, just take a small toke.
It's not that strong.
It's so weak, they call it g*n Control in America.
CECE: Hey, babe.
I found the hairspray, and Oh, my God, you're in your dress.
Babe, you look so beautiful.
I can't believe you're finally getting married, and - Cece!
- Hey!
Oh, my God, I am so high.
- (whispering): Come here.
- Mm-hmm.
I have something to tell you.
- Come here.
- Okay, I'm here.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you do, don't tell Cece.
- Mmm.
- Oh, my God.
Okay, how much of your mom's stuff did you smoke?
It is so mild.
Like, I don't even feel it.
- Nothing, huh?
- If I look in your eyes,
- can you taste what I'm tasting?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, we have - 60 minutes till the wedding.
- No, look into my googly eye.
- Uh, do I have to?
- Yeah.
- You taste delicious vanilla cake?
- No.
- Damn it.
- Okay, here's the plan.
I am going to fix your makeup, - and then we ride this thing out.
- Oh, I've got a plan.
- What?
- Check this out.
- This is gonna be good.
- What is happening?
Or strap on a spare patch, and Nick marries a sexy fly.
(buzzing)
I'm just gonna remove this.
Okay, here we go.
- I can see.
- Yes, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- So the upside to this is, at least you are not freaking out
- about your wedding being cursed.
- Yeah.
- That's a bonus.
- Oh, Cece, question.
- Uh-huh.
- At what size does a cup - become a bucket?
- Uh - Jess.
- Russell!
How the hell are you?
Good.
You, look, um Gosh.
Mmm, did you have some cake yet?
Uh, tons of it at my house, but that's my issue.
Look, I really need to talk with you, Jess.
- Okay.
- (Aly groaning loudly)
Did I make that sound with my mind?
- CECE: You okay, Aly?
- Mm-hmm, I'm fine.
I just swallowed a wasp, and it stung me inside of my throat a bunch of times.
I don't see what the big deal is.
Please stay away from me!
Okay.
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go after that girl right there.
Russell, could you please keep an eye on Jess?
Don't let her out of your sight.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Uh, Jess, you're, um your right eye's kind of stuck.
(singsongy)
: Not if I do this.
Much better now.
Hey, so, um, we think we may have done a bad job with your toast.
SCHMIDT: Uh, it's Winston's fault.
- What?
No.
It is entirely Schmidt's fault.
- This is not a funny man.
Doesn't matter.
Look, we want to make it up to you, so if there's anything that we can do, please just l-let us know.
- Our marriage is cursed.
- Wh-What do you mean, cursed?
Last night I seduced Jess at the, uh, rehearsal dinner.
I dangled my hot body in front of her, and she couldn't resist, and we had a night of weird, wild sex that would have made the good Lord proud, and now our marriage is cursed.
Come on, man.
None of that stuff is true.
Curses aren't real.
Yeah, but you believe in crystals, Winston.
Crystals are real, dude.
Don't say nothing bad about crystals!
Merle said he's not publishing Chicago Hobo,
- and then a bird pooed on me.
- SCHMIDT: What do you mean,
- he won't publish it?
- Where's the bird?
I'll poo on him.
Those two things happened back-to-back.
That's a curse.
Stop being such a goy boy.
You go find Merle, and you tell him that you are not writing another Pepperwood until he publishes Chicago Hobo.
- You think it'll work?
- I know so, okay?
He's right over there.
We believe in you.
- You can do this.
- I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna do it well.
- Hell, yeah.
- That's right.
- (whoops)
- Well, guess we fixed the toast.
(indistinct chatter)
Look at our boy, all grown up.
Little disappointed about what we talked about.
You know, you and I we make a good combination.
- Winston and Schmidt.
- Mm-hmm.
- I set 'em up, you - And I set 'em up.
All right.
It looked good, man.
How'd it go?
Good, good, good.
He told me to go to hell and that he's not gonna publish Pepperwood anymore,
- and I basically lost my job, so
- Mm.
(slurps)
Uh Curses are real, people!
They are real!
I got to go protect my bride.
WOMAN: This is the oddest wedding.
(groaning loudly)
Oh, hey, Cece.
Oh, I'm so mad about politics.
Aah!
Aly, you are having the baby, okay?
- I know those labor eyes, sister.
- Okay, fine.
- I'm in labor.
- I know!
Why is this how we make more people?
It's a terrible system.
Oh, honey, we got to get Winston,
- we got to get you to the hospital.
- No, no, no.
I don't want to go until after the wedding.
Aah!
Take me to drugs.
Take me to drugs right now.
There we go.
All right, here we go.
I don't want to scare you, but this is the easy part.
- You feeling better?
- Yeah, yeah.
The fresh air's really helping.
We're in a stairwell.
Ugh.
You must think I'm the worst for going elbow deep in the ganj.
Nah.
In fact, I was high for, well, all my weddings.
Whatever gets you down the aisle.
Well, I seduced Nick last night.
I lured him into my bridal chambers, and now we're getting evicted, my eye looks like ground beef, and I cursed our marriage.
- You believe in curses?
- Not normally, but I just want to know that Nick and I are safe, and no cartoon anvil's gonna fall out of the sky and crush us to smithereens.
Is that crazy?
No, but maybe it's not signs and curses you're worried about.
Maybe it's the relationship?
I mean, maybe, deep down, you know you and Nick aren't right for each other.
Wait, what?
What are you running from?
Here I am, sitting with an amazing, beautiful, smart woman on her wedding day, and she's stoned and wearing an eye patch, and sitting in a dank stairwell with her ex.
You want to talk about signs, that's a sign.
A sign of what?
Don't marry Nick.
Be with me.
Jess.
I love you.
Oh, boy.
Ooh, hey, honey.
Hey, Ruth, is Aunt Jess here?
- I really need to talk to her.
- What's the password?
WINSTON: Oh, the password.
Oh, uh, yeah, it's - Ruth 1.
- Wrong.
- Ruth 2?
- Wrong.
- Ruth 3?
- Wrong.
- Don't do this to me, kid.
- Wrong.
Ruth, honey, just tell us where Aunt Jess is, okay?
Sure, for a hundred bucks.
- I ain't got that.
- I've never been more proud of that I mean, this is my daughter.
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.
Ruth.
Man to man, I need to talk to Jess.
I need to know if she's okay.
But they're not back there.
They're on the stairs.
- Who's "they"?
- RUSSELL: Look.
When you first started working, I thought I was gonna be fine, I was over it, and then the more time we spent with each other, it just all came rushing back.
And you're choosing to tell me this now?
We've been together literally every day
- for the past week and a half.
- Yeah.
I shouldn't be telling you any of this, but I also know
- that if I didn't, I'd regret it forever.
- Russell, I am in love with Nick, 100%, okay?
This is not puppy love.
This is old-ass dog love.
Do you remember your first date with Nick?
You ran into me sign and I asked you both to write down what you meant to each other on the back of some valet ticket.
You kept those?
I think you should look at those before you get married.
Neither of you were ever sure about this, not really.
Not deep down.
Jess, be with me.
Let me give you the life you deserve.
- Let me make you happy.
- (door opens)
- Let me make you d*ad, you son of a bitch!
- Oh, Nick!
- (shouts)
- Oh!
No!
(shouts)
(shouting)
NICK: I'm gonna get you
WINSTON: What you think you're doing, Russell, huh?
Don't you have enough wives, you slut?
- I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning!
- Take that!
I'm losing, I'm losing he's so slippery!
He's like a dolphin!
Wow, Jess.
- That dress.
You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.
But your eye.
What happened to your eye?
- No Oh.
- Did this son of a bitch steal your eye?!
- I'll k*ll you!
- No, no, I hurt my eye, and then my mom gave me some of that sweet Portland b*mb-a.
Look, Nick, I love you.
I have no feelings for Russell.
But how could you not?
He is so handsome!
I mean, look at him!
He's physically outstanding!
And it's all my fault!
Because I brought the curse on us!
Did the curse make you more handsome?!
- Yeah.
- That's my question to you!
- He is physically incredible!
- Nick, please don't fight him.
We both know you're gonna lose.
- BOTH: Let's do this!
- SCHMIDT: I got your back, man!
- Let's do it!
- Yeah, unlucky for you, I'm packin'.
RUSSELL: Oh, yeah?
I can take all three of you.
I kick.
I kick really high!
You're all so bad at fighting!
- Boys, what's the strategy?
- We h*t him, - then we h*t his ass again!
- Uh-oh, - I think he heard your strategy.
- Nick, take your clothes off.
- What?!
Why?!
- I just got your suit pressed.
- Time-out.
- Time.
Time.
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
- Aly is in labor.
- What?
My baby's having my baby?
My baby's having my baby!
Are you okay?
I love you so much.
What if it comes out covered in all the gum
- I've ever swallowed?
- Baby, you'll be fine.
- I'll call the doula.
- The doula's at Lollapalooza.
Please tell me one of you g*ons is sober enough to drive this
- circus to the hospital.
- Not me.
I've been drinking all day.
I only have one working eye!
Well, I'll take you to the hospital.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- CECE: Great!
Uh, we'll b*at you up after the baby is born.
Why would you say that?
Babe, why is your crystal out?
Were you fighting?
Aly, Winston, you come with me.
- (elevator bell dings)
- Wait, everybody come.
I forgot who we're dealing with.
(tires screech)
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, only Blaze drives the limo!
(car horn honks)
Damn, they said, "Blaze, you gonna lose it.
" And I was like, "Nah, it's too big.
" (chuckles)
Are you holding it in?
You got to hold it in.
Don't want it to fall on the ground and get dirty.
That's not how it works.
I'm really nervous about what you don't know.
Hey, are we positive that this hospital has a baby department?
- I think so.
- I hope so.
Ooh, Dr.
Silverstein.
Good to see you.
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, Russell.
Catch.
Your sixth wife is out there somewhere.
It's just not me.
Good-bye, Jess.
Good-bye, Russell.
Hey, do the right thing and get us the most expensive thing on the registry.
(chuckles)
Drive.
Sorry about your hand.
- (groans)
- At least we're in a hospital.
- Does it hurt?
- Definitely.
- Russell is shockingly strong.
- Yeah.
Especially for a boy his age.
I guess the curse is real.
Yeah, we got evicted.
A bird deuced on my shoulder.
I say this with love, but your eye is trash.
Merle went crazy and decided that a book about a hobo with electric ankles wasn't a home run.
And now I'm out of a job.
We don't have a home.
I mean, we're cursed.
- (laughs)
It's kind of our thing.
- Yeah, it is.
I mean, even the first time I kissed you, you know, you were still dating Dr.
Sam.
And now here we are in a hospital waiting room, three miles away from our wedding.
- Figures.
Sounds like us.
- Yeah.
Hey, do you remember on our first date we wrote how we felt about each other on two valet tickets?
Ah, Jess, I'm sorry.
I was just scared to tell you how I really felt.
I was scared, too.
We've both been scared about so many things for so long, and you know what?
I don't care about the past or the future.
All that I care about is right now, right here, you and me.
I just want to have a weird, wonderful life together.
You know?
I want to get married and I want to take care of you, and I don't even care about a stupid curse.
Guys, guess what.
- Oh, my God.
- Is the baby here?
No, Aly's only three centimeters.
It's gonna be another 13 hours.
Yeah, the doctor told me to run around and burn off some energy.
I was not being helpful.
I'm excited!
(laughs)
- Wait, where are you going?
- WINSTON: Huh?
- It's that way.
- It's over here.
Okay.
- Wrong room.
- Wrong room.
- Aah, aah!
- Nope, nope.
Nope, nope.
Back over here.
Oh!
I just came from here.
- Yeah, we know.
- That's where she is.
Go in.
(Winston whoops)
Hey, Jess.
Do you want to have the weirdest wedding of all time?
To you?
That's all I want, Miller.
This is it.
How do I look?
Beautif Beautiful.
(Cece clucks tongue, sighs)
Thanks for putting this together.
Of course.
Oh, thanks for doing this, Padre.
You know, my day is normally wall-to-wall death, but, uh, you said so many wonderful things about this man, I couldn't help but say yes.
I thought I was just a monkey with a typewriter.
Winston's fault.
That was his fault, 100%.
(whispering): Thank you.
Love you, man.
You two seem like a very happy couple.
- Thank you.
- I'm not marrying him.
I'm marrying a girl.
- That's okay, too.
- Music.
("Groovy Kind of Love" by Phil Collins playing)
When I'm feeling blue All I have to do Is take a look Can we hurry this along?
We're three minutes till the next contraction.
Oh, no, I'm wearing white to a wedding.
When you're close to me I can feel your heart b*at I can hear you breathing Near my ear Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me Got a groovy Ooh.
Take care of our pirate bride.
I'm very proud of you, son.
I heard you fought like a coward - for my daughter today.
- (chuckles)
Thanks.
(whispering): I love you.
Anything you want to
- Hey.
- Hey.
We doing this, Jessica Day?
We're doing this, Nick Miller.
- It's about damn time.
- (Jess chuckles)
CHAPLAIN: Friends, we've been invited here today to share with Nick and Jess in a very important moment in their lives.
Jess, do you take Nick?
JESS: I do.
CHAPLAIN: Nick, do you take Jess?
NICK: I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Okay.
- Oh, damn.
- Is it bad?
- Mm.
- I've seen worse.
I mean, literally ten minutes ago.
I think you'll be happy if it's covered.
(laughing): Sure.
It's you and me now.
(whoops)
(whooping and cheering)
- Hey!
- Ah!
(baby cooing)
Everybody meet Dan Bill Bishop.
Oh.
Daniel William?
Nah, Dan Bill.
Uh, is Bill the middle name?
Nah.
Dan Bill.
Dan Bill Bishop.
Family name or?
- Nah, it's Dan Bill.
- Oh.
Tell them you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
It's Dan Bill Bishop.
- What?
- I'm not joking.
It's Dan Bill Bishop.
ALY: We're gonna talk about this.
WINSTON: You were sleeping.
I made an executive decision.
Guys, this has been fun, but it's time to go start my pre-date regimen.
(to "Party Rock Anthem"): Body wash is in the house tonight!
Ugh, that jacket!
What are you and Aly doing tonight going to a Sinbad stand-up special?
I'm gonna go pick up my colorblind glasses from USC.
I'm a part of a study.
Now, these glasses allow a colorblind person to see color.
If they don't work, I get $25.
If they do work, they're gonna take a bunch of my bone marrow.
I just hope he puts on those glasses and realizes how truly hideous that Salt-N-Pepa jacket is.
I mean, at least he stopped wearing the pants that go with it.
- (laughs)
- Oh, my gosh, you guys, thank you so much for getting me out of the house tonight.
Winston is insisting we Stay in?
Why are you staying in?
Because I might be overwhelmed by the world beyond sharp brown.
Dull brown.
Brown.
You know, Aly's making sherbet tonight if you guys want to come over.
While the idea of witnessing you seeing sherbet for the first time is enticing, I have plans tonight.
Ooh, I see that eyebrow waggle.
Yeah, that means you going on a Sex date!
We are having sex tonight - out of our daughter's earshot.
- Okay.
Tell me, in the realm of Cece and Schmidt sex-capades, like, how far out are you going?
Are you, like, crossing state lines or?
No.
Tonight, we are actually gonna keep it simple.
I have made extremely elaborate plans.
I've lined up a babysitter, booked a hotel room, commissioned a new negligee, custom-made by a Japanese man that I found on EtsyXXX.
- I can't wait for Cece to see me in it.
- What?
I think that he bought me some sort of Japanese negligee.
- (laughter)
- I know.
I found it, like, hidden in the back of the closet.
I'm gonna need a team of people to get me into that.
Winston once bought me a Canadian Mountie uniform.
- CECE: No, he did not.
- Not to be graphic,
- but he destroyed it in seconds.
- (laughter) So, Jess, what are you up to tonight?
Remember when Nick and I tried to adopt that dog and got rejected?
(crying): I love you so much, Harriet.
I'm never gonna put you down.
I'm never gonna let you go.
I still don't get this.
They took a dog away from someone for loving it too much?
They said my enthusiasm for Harriet bordered on madness.
Oh, I-I can see that.
Well, it's been two long years on the wait list, but Everything changes tonight.
- I'm asking Jess to marry me.
- Wow
- (whoops) Ha!
- Tonight.
Well, it's about time.
You've been talking about this for a month.
I don't need this from you.
I get it enough from Jess's dad.
Bob called me nine times today to tell me that his blessing expires at midnight.
- (whistles) - He said if I miss the deadline, my buttocks are gravy.
Guy's got some weird expressions.
Why would you wait till the last minute for something like this?
'Cause everything has to be perfect; Jess is gonna think about this moment for the rest of our lives.
I almost asked her at the park, but a squirrel ran off with our ring.
Don't worry, I got the ring back, but let me just say this, the squirrel will never do that again.
And then I got us on the kiss cam at Dodger Stadium.
That's where I was gonna ask, but once we got on the scoreboard, I just went for the laugh and I kissed the old guy next to me.
Anything's funny when you put an old man in it.
Except for the ground.
NICK: But this time, I have everything planned.
Nothing's stopping me tonight.
I made reservations at the same place we went on our first date.
Finally, I'm gonna make an honest woman of My new dog.
I'm so excited.
And I get to surprise Nick 'cause he doesn't know about it.
Our family is growing - by four small paws.
- Okay, whoa.
You need to reel that back in, sweetheart.
Okay, I think you're right.
There is a fine line between enthusiasm and madness, and I do need to keep this in check.
Come on, ladies.
Let's toast to
- Nick and Jess.
All right.
- BOTH: Yeah!
And to us going on dates at the same time
- (laughs)
- leading to a high probability that we'll all be doing it at the same time.
I'm not cheersing that, man.
Stop.
- I think it's nice.
- Yeah, it'll be like one big orgy, but, you know, we're spaced out.
Never mind.
I retract my support.
(toy squeaking rhythmically) Who's hungry?
I'm hungry.
You ready for our reservation?
We have a What is all this, Jess?
It's happening It's happening!
- No.
No.
No.
No.
- (toy squeaks) Allow me to practice being appropriately excited about the following information.
- We're getting a dog.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- We've waited two years for this.
- This could be a really big deal for us.
- Yeah.
This could be the night that we welcome a new family member
- into our home.
I just - Wow.
I don't want to blow it, so you have to help me keep it together when Judith from the shelter gets here, 'cause she has to do a home visit
- before she signs off.
- You're not gonna blow it.
We will form a great game plan at dinner, so let's go now, 'cause we got
- that reservation, like I was saying.
- No.
No.
We have that reservation, like I was saying.
We don't have time for dinner.
She's gonna get here any minute.
You know, last time, she was very thorough.
- Yes.
- It could take a long time.
This is fine.
This is foine.
This is good.
This is great.
I'll push our reservation.
I'll tell the restaurant we're celebrating tonight.
We weren't before, but we are now.
Get an outdoor table so we can bring our new puppy.
- That's not the plan.
- Say, "Make room.
" We got to bring
- The dog is not
- a dog, a dog bed, a water bowl
- Good talk.
- some toys, some chewies.
(toy squeaks)
(toy squeaking rhythmically)
I got you some stuff.
Oh, my gosh, you didn't Will you look at this?
Puzzles, a book on subway graffiti.
Candy?
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait a minute.
Baby, candy is different colors?
That's what I've been trying to tell to you.
Everything is different colors.
Well, I'll see you on the other side.
(Winston gasps)
(laughs): Oh, my God.
Baby.
Mm.
Nobody told me fruit was different colors!
- I thought you knew.
- I didn't know about fruit, baby!
- Now you know.
- Ah!
- Oh!
This-this, uh, is purple.
- That's right.
- I'm touching purple?
- Yeah.
- I'm touching purple.
- Oh, don't cry.
- No, don't cry, baby.
- (crying) - (gasps) Are my socks blue?
- Blue.
- Your socks are blue.
- I hate blue so much!
- Calm down, baby.
Okay.
Okay.
- Aah!
Some more blue!
Get that Just calm down.
Do you want me to find you something brown to look at?
Would that be soothing?
I just think I need to I just need to take it slow.
I am right here with you.
Why don't we go sit on the couch?
Baby, what color is that couch gonna be?
Oh, don't make that a whole thing.
(screaming) Oh, I did not solve this Rubik's Cube.
Help yourself to anything within reason.
You may think to yourself, "Oh, they have a lot of expensive cheeses.
They won't notice.
" We wil notice.
Okay, so, Ruth is asleep.
That little face.
I love her more every day.
And, oh, look at you.
Tell your genitals to get their affairs in order.
Oh, my genitals know what they're getting into.
(chuckles) Hey, I have really exciting news.
I'm ovulating.
It's time for another baby!
Let's get to the hotel!
We're so sorry to crash your date.
Our hotel reservation fell through.
WINSTON: Are you kidding me?
I mean, I am so excited to have you guys here for my big day.
Kind of wish you were here earlier.
He was being a complete bitch about pink.
No, I was not.
I was confused, because they want to be red so bad, and I'm like, "You're not red.
Like, stop.
" You know what I mean?
(laughs) Well, this is gonna be fun.
- For a little while.
- Or a long while.
Who knows?
JESS: Judith is gonna be here any minute, and I need you to test me.
I looked up "cute dog" on the Internet, and I printed out a bunch of images, so I just need you to shove a cute dog in my face until I find something disgusting about it.
I can do that.
Oh.
He's so teeny tiny that he fits in his food bowl.
And he climbed in.
He wiggled around.
(laughs): He knocked all his food out.
Which sucks, because there are so many starving people in the world.
- Next dog.
- Now we're talking.
Good.
I know what I hate, but I'm not sure what you're gonna hate.
JESS (laughs): Oh, my God.
I want to like this little lug.
Jess, what do you hate about this dog?
She's wearing a princess costume, which enforces gender stereotypes in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable.
Next dog.
I hate to do this one to you.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What do you dislike strongly?
Is this guy rocking a jean jacket?
Unfortunately, yes.
I don't hate that!
- (knock on door)
- Oh, my God.
She's here.
She's here.
I feel ready.
I feel ready.
- Why are you acting so weird?
- I'm not acting weird.
Winston, will you come with me?
I'd love to be the first person to show you a raincoat.
I knew something was going on with raincoats.
- Hmm.
- Watch out.
Excuse me, baby.
What's wrong, Schmidt?
You look green.
Is it green?
Cece wants to get pregnant again.
Oh.
(whimpers softly) Ms.
Day, Mr.
Miller.
I'm hoping the second time's the charm.
I'd like to introduce Mario.
- Mario.
- You're squeezing real hard, Jess.
Your pictures don't do you justice.
- (chuckles) - Will you excuse me a minute?
- (laughs) - Very excited.
(muffled screaming) Cece wants to get pregnant?
Isn't that good news?
Don't you want, like, a hundred kids?
Yes, I do.
I just How can I survive another nine months of pregnant Cece?
She was so mean to me.
I got your wings, my love.
I wanted all flats, no drumlets!
- Do they look flat to you?!
- (muffled grunting) Do they look flat to you?!
She tried to jam the business end of a drumlet straight up my tuchus.
And then things got worse.
I can only describe what I experienced next as anti-Semitic.
Hey, gefilte face!
Quit playing "Where's My Foreskin?" and get in here and rub my feet before I divorce your Yentl-loving, n*zi ass!
(sighs) I knew this day would come, but just thought I had more time.
Schmidt, you're being crazy, man.
Just go talk to your wife about this.
I can't do that.
My only option is to knock her up and then disappear into the night.
I'm gonna need you and Nick to take care of my family while I'm in hiding.
Hey, be honest with her.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to stare at my tongue in the mirror.
So, as you can see, we have lots of toys - for Mario to play with.
- (toy squeaking) And it looks like he's found one he enjoys.
Look at that.
(sniffles) - Good for him.
- Can I just say, I had some serious doubts about you getting a dog from us after what happened last time.
You had a real Of Mice and Men vibe.
Did I?
(laughs) I mean, who gets emotional - over how cute a dog is, right?
(laughs) - Oh.
People with something missing inside of them?
(both laugh) Will you excuse me a minute?
Mm-hmm.
- Hi, cutie.
(chuckles)
- (Mario whimpers) Annabelle, you got to help me out.
Mr.
Miller, in 30 minutes, I'll have a barstool and a high chair.
I might be able to get you a table, but I can't guarantee that your mariachi band is gonna hang around.
- (beep)
- I'm so sorry.
Can you please hold?
Come on, Miller.
Bob, I don't have time for this.
- Clock's ticking, bub!
- I know.
But the hostess just offered me a barstool and a high chair,
- and I think I have to take it.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me talk to her.
Merge me.
Merge me.
You asked for it.
Here's Annabelle.
Nobody say a word.
Hey.
I'm not doing anything.
- What are you doing?
- I have to get this out of my system.
(high-pitched): Mmm!
You want to cuddle with Mommy?
You want to cuddle with Mommy?
What's your name?
Oh, widdle baby tired.
He-wo.
He-wo.
What's your name?
Is it Mario?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is!
Okay.
Okay.
I got that out of my system.
Now we have to go sign some paperwork.
Paperwork for a dog?
What, are we buying or leasing?
- Just get there fast, okay?
- We can do fast.
I like this.
We got this.
(exhales) Fast, fast, fast.
You guys still on the phone?
Mr.
Miller, I did not realize you were taking care of a sick relative.
If you can get here in the next 30 minutes, I can squeeze you in to a normal table.
Thank you.
30 minutes.
Thank you.
BOB: Nick, go!
Hey, Annabelle.
Tell me, uh you do a nice rib eye?
Oh, no.
Between me and you, it's trash.
That's enough.
- Cannot drink it, so I'm gonna pour it.
- (chuckles) CECE: Hey, Schmidt.
It's getting a little late.
Maybe we should, you know, move along to that second location.
(sighs) Cecilia I have something I need to say to you.
Okay.
Um first, let me say what an amazing mother and woman and partner you are.
And deep down, I truly do I truly do believe that you are a good person.
A good person who likes Jews.
- You like Jews just fine.
- Schmidt?
I'm nervous about us getting pregnant again.
You are?
Why?
Because your temperament while pregnant is, um Wish I had the words.
- Winnie.
- Hmm?
- He have the words for you?
- The words he used were - "constant terror.
" - Why would you repeat that?
Well, 'cause you know I'm scared of Cece.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I was a little bit moody while I was creating life with my body.
Aly, can you believe this?
- Well - Well?
Okay, d-don't be mad, but I have never, ever seen anyone be pregnant the way that you were pregnant.
So much so that, for evidence, I decided to capture it on my phone.
CECE (on phone): What genius got us a Jolly Jumper?
Who got us the Jol Okay, Vandana Auntie, way to go.
You see, we already have a Jolly Jumper.
So put the tuna salad down.
Put it down!
Tuna salad is for people who use the registry.
Boo!
Everybody boo.
- Why are you not booing?!
- I honestly don't
- remember that.
- Oh, it's okay, Cecilia.
Also, thanks for having my back, Aly.
Whoa.
I do not have your back.
Yeah, I've also never seen someone pregnant the way you were pregnant.
You were a coddling, blubbering mess.
Aly, come closer, I want you to capture the luminescence
- of Cece's hair.
- Shut up and keep brushing.
You are a lifemaker.
You have the jewel of life inside of you.
Cece, what do you need?
I'll get you anything you need.
You'll never have to move again.
That was hard for me to watch.
- Uh, I was unbearable.
- Yeah, we both were.
(chuckles) Hate to see if you had any videos of me
- in that phone, which you don't
- I do.
Mountie costume!
JUDITH: Since this is a fourth-floor loft, will you be creating a f*re plan with Mario?
We'd love his input.
She means yes.
Man, you got a lot of questions, Judith.
And if you were on a walk with Mario and you encountered a coyote, what would you do?
I'd run away.
(chuckles)
- He's joking.
- No.
I mean, what I would do is I'd pick up Mario, and then I'd run away.
And who would take Mario if your relationship were to end?
Oh, thank God.
That's an easy one.
I would take him.
- If we break up, I'd take him.
- What?!
- You think we're gonna break up?
- I didn't say No, no, no, no.
JUDITH: You know what?
I actually I missed a question.
How do you feel about pee pads?
JESS: So in your vision of the future, we break up, you get to take Mario, and I'm left alone with some poop bags?
- What are poop bags?
- They're the bags that you put the dog's poop in.
Why would you put dog poo in bags, Jess?
It was a hypothetical question.
But you answered it so quickly.
Because I thought we were trying to rush Judith.
We were.
I just didn't think you'd be able to answer that question so easily.
I mean, do you see us breaking up?
No, I don't want to break up ever.
I just
- (phone ringing) Hold on.
Sorry.
- Who is that?
It's just the restaurant we're having dinner tonight, okay?
- It's no big deal.
- Look, I know this might not be the most convenient time to talk about this, but we're about to become parents to a dog, and I need to know we're on the same page.
We are on the same page.
I'm really sorry.
- I have to answer this one.
- You need to take a phone call when I'm telling you how I feel about our relationship?
You know what?
Let me take that phone call.
Hello?
Annabelle from Beso.
Well, we're not coming.
Okay.
Bye.
Where were we?
- You know what's crazy?
- Mm.
Even after seeing all those videos, I still want to have another baby with you more than anything else in the whole wide world.
Me, too, more than anything.
Things are gonna be so different this time.
I'm gonna give you so much space.
I'm gonna be so pro-Semitic, that little beanie you wear on the top of your head is gonna spin.
Feels like a rough start, but I appreciate the effort.
- Let's go to the hotel.
- We're never gonna make it there and back in time to relieve the babysitter.
You know what?
I know someplace on the way.
There's no way that they're home.
Nick is keeping those dinner reservations, I guarantee it.
I didn't know when and I didn't know why, but I knew that one day I'd be having sex in this loft again.
I hope Winston's room still has that exercise bike in it.
- I have an idea.
- Mm.
You wouldn't think that woman would have a urinal in her bathroom.
No, I can't go out looking like this.
- I can't stay in looking like this.
- Uh What?!
No!
You seeing this?!
I ain't got no sense of fashion.
You weren't gonna tell me?
- I did, many times.
- Then why didn't you leave me?!
I did, when you bought those banana-yellow bird pants, but I came back because I love you just a little more than I hate those pants.
(chuckles) Why-why are you taking them off?
I just missed seeing your face with my own eyes.
Look, I know there's a lot of beautiful things that I have not seen, but nothing in this world will make me take my eyes off of you.
Why are you so sweet to me?
- (Winston chuckles) - Mm.
But we only have these for a few more hours, and I want you to see as much as you can, babe.
All right, what's next?
I want to see some classic movies in color: Citizen Kane, Schindler's List Ooh, I got bad news for you.
(chuckles) This is a surprise.
A real slobber goblin tonight, huh?
What are you talking about?
- Cece?
- What?
We are not alone in this bed.
- (both screaming)
- (Mario barking)
- Aah!
Whoa!
Aah!
Wait!
- (Cece shrieking) No!
- (shrieking) - No, no.
Dog!
- No!
- Dog!
Horny dog!
That terrier att*cked my sensitive area!
Okay, how do you think I feel?
You confused me for a dog.
I've never seen a naked man before.
Oh, what are you guys doing here?
- Who are these people?
- We're trying for another baby.
Oh, my God.
Congratulations!
We're adopting a dog!
No, you're not.
I've had enough.
I'm taking Mario.
Wait!
Don't take that dog.
Jess deserves Mario.
This woman is amazing.
She's gonna love that dog so much that she's gonna pick up its poop and keep it in bags.
- (Mario whimpers) - Oh, wait!
Mario!
Mario?!
Where are you?!
Mario?!
- There he is!
- (Mario barking)
- Mario!
- Mario!
Mario!
Is that Nick and Jess?
- Mario!
- Mario!
Mario?
Mario?
Mario?
(barking) I got eyes on him!
(grunts) - Okay.
- (Mario whimpers) Oh, my God.
You got him.
That was heroic.
I mean, it was so stupid, but it really it was heroic.
- Yeah.
- Mario.
I am so mad at you, but I love you.
I mean, first you're running away from us, now you're happy to see us.
You are all over the map, Mario Day-Miller.
- (phone ringing) - I got to grab that.
Is that my dad?
Yes, yeah, your dad He, uh he calls me every time he he meets somebody from Chicago.
I mean, he'll ask me, he'll go, "Do you know Tim from Chicago?
'Cause he doesn't know you.
" And then I just say "No," and then, yeah.
That doesn't make any sense.
My dad doesn't even like you.
Well, that's what happens - Whatever.
Who cares?
- Wait.
Beso's where we went on our first date.
Did we?
I'm restaurant blind.
I don't remember restaurants.
Okay, now, we got to get Mario back home before Judith remembers she wants to take him back.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Wait.
(gasps) Sweat back!
Nick, you're lying to me.
Oh, my God.
Nick, this dinner were you gonna?
Jess, I had been planning this for so long.
I just wanted everything to be perfect.
But it is perfect.
I mean, it's us, so this is as perfect as it gets.
Okay.
(gasps) Is he about to?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
All right.
He's been keeping the engagement ring in a plastic bag.
It's not even a Ziploc bag.
It's just a generic plastic bag.
(sighs) Jessica Day (laughs) will you marry me?
Nick, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I want to raise this dog with you, and I want to have babies and eat good food and laugh and take care of each other.
And I want it to start tonight.
It's you and me.
It's It's always been you and me.
- Is that a "yes"?
- Yes!
Yes!
She said yes!
- I've had the time of my life
- (Jess laughs) No, I never felt this way before Oh, USC's never getting these glasses back.
- They can take my bone marrow.
- (Aly laughs) (laughter) Okay, so who gets the dog if you get a divorce?
ALL: Shut up, Judith!
- Dad, I said yes!
- I did it, Bob.
Oh, I don't know why you spent so much of the story talking about that color-blind friend of yours, but I'm so happy!
Dad, can you lean away?
You're bl*wing out the speaker.
- (sobbing)
- Dad, are you okay?
His reaction doesn't bode well for the speech at the wedding.
What do you mean?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers to you, too.
Oh.
(crying)
- Mmm.
- Can you two please tell us why you summoned us here?
Thank you for coming.
It is appreciated, especially since Aly is on bed rest.
We brought you here today to choose a godparent.
Oh, yes!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Now, on my side, we have my entire network of good friends.
Friends so close, I consider them family.
And on my side, we have Leslie.
- I'm all she's got.
- Oh, boy.
All right, everybody, please line up in formation.
Winston, I don't have time for this.
It's my first day back at Ass Strat tomorrow.
I should be moisturizing and making dreams.
Schmidt, we didn't choose you.
- You may face the wall.
- Dork!
- Watch it.
- Cece, we didn't choose you either.
Reason being is your friendship is too important to ruin by making you our baby's godmother.
Mm-hmm.
Why do I feel like your lips are moving - but Aly's doing the talking?
- Sorry.
- Nick?
- I got a good feeling about this.
Face the wall.
Ooh.
This ain't over.
Leslie, you may face the wall.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Suck it, bitch!
- Leslie, you lost.
Leslie is confused.
And now the moment of truth.
Jessica Day, will you be our baby's godmother?
Yes, I will.
Why is Leslie still dancing?
Leslie.
- Hey, now we're both godparents.
- What?
Nick, for the hundredth time, you are not Ruth's godfather.
Yes, I am, for the hundred and one time first time.
First of all, Jews and Hindus do not have godparents.
And even if we did, we would not choose you.
Ruth is not a fan.
Ruth doesn't like me?
She sees you more as a dimwitted raccoon.
Well, my mind is bl*wn.
This is a game changer.
Okay, everyone leave.
Okay, that was a waste of time.
We got a babysitter for this?
Jess, can you stay back for a moment?
Yeah.
You chose wisely.
I will revolutionize being a godparent.
Your son will be my Cinderell o.
We'll be reviewing your performance weekly.
You can be replaced.
Heavy is the head that holds the crown, but strong are the neck muscles that hold up said head.
Ooh.
Cigarette!
- Well done.
- Well done.
Uh, before I move on to the next slide, let me just say thank you for agreeing to stay at home this week while I get back in the saddle at work.
Now, you need to pick up Ruth at 2:00 p.
m.
on the dot.
The three pillars of the pickup are gate code, sign out, and lunch, which needs to be a peanut butter sandwich, otherwise, she will shut down and go - full armadillo.
- Yeah, I got it.
Pick her up, drop her off.
- How hard can it be?
- Well, first of all, you got it backwards.
You drop off in the morning, you pick up in the after I'm sorry.
I'm a little stressed out.
I know that I said that I would go back to work when Ruth started school, which, look, I'm-I'm excited about.
But I've been out of the game for a while, and I've become accustomed to a different type of lifestyle.
Daddy was gonna get into that party no matter what, so I jumped over the hedge.
Of course.
It was Prince!
You get it.
We'll be fine.
What you see as a life-or-death mission, I see as a week off with my daughter.
Wrong again.
Buckle up.
These should cover your first four hours.
Okay, I'm off.
Yeah, you need to go.
Okay?
Now get.
I'm excited.
I shaved my entire body last night.
I feel like I could ride the wind to work.
And here comes a contraction.
Thank you for filling in for Aly.
- Of course.
I'm the godmother.
- And one, two, three, primal scream.
Oh, my God!
That's a big hea Sorry.
Okay, and now let's practice some pelvic tilts on the birthing ball.
Oh.
Excuse me.
I-I realize you didn't get me one, so I'm gonna go ahead and get my own.
Uh - Got the big boy.
- Yeah.
Whew!
You know what's crazy is you're gonna be a father any day now.
- Yeah, it kind of snuck up on me.
- Yeah, you better get ready, 'cause you're gonna get on the Dad Train soon.
Dad-dad!
"No getting off this train.
" - You okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
Well, all right.
Who would like to demonstrate how to hold a baby?
Any takers?
What about you?
Oh, not me.
That baby's creep city.
Winnie, you're up.
Me?
Oh.
Yeah.
- Let's go, Dad.
- Okay.
Hold it like this?
- Cradle the head.
- Cradle it.
Yeah.
Well, look at you.
I promise to love and protect you.
Nobody's ever gonna hurt my goochy, goochy - Oh!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Okay, and I'm sorry.
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna fix him.
I'm not ready.
- No.
- Here, put that back.
Put that back inside of you.
I don't want no part of that.
Look at us, the unbreakable Kim and Schmidt.
God, I forgot how much I despise you.
We're gonna need your thoughts on a new salsa account, - so get up to speed.
- Oh, I am up to speed on salsa.
Now heads up, Schmidt, things have changed here.
It's not the same office you left.
Ass Strat has been taken over by a Tokyo-based conglomerate.
Are the toilets also Japa Yes.
"Cecilia, you're playing your music too loud.
" What's that, babe?
Yeah, you know, I can't hear you out here with - Oh, my God!
- What, are we having a laundry party?
- What is that?!
- This?
It's just a bear I found outside the loft.
Yeah, I brought it for my girl Ruth.
Well, she's at school right now, and I have 15 binders worth of stuff to do that Schmidt has left for me
- before I go pick her up.
- Oh, that's perfect.
I'll just pick her up.
I'll pick her up from school.
I don't need your help picking up my daughter from school.
Okay?
All right, well, would you please tell her that I left this bear for her so she knows it was from me?
- Mm-mm.
- Ugh.
- What?
- There's ants all over its neck.
- What?
- Oh!
There's more ants.
Every time it gets h*t, more ants come out.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, buddy.
So, two things.
Um, first of all, we're not welcome back in the class.
And, second, they're billing you for all ten classes.
Jess, what if I'm not ready to be a father?
Winston, that was a fake baby.
Real babies' heads - don't come off like that.
- Jess, I was in that class and it made me realize that this baby is coming.
What happens when I'm in that hospital and I see my son's face for the first time, coming out of Aly's butt?
What am I gonna do?
What if there's something that I don't know?
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but ever since I found out Aly was pregnant, I keep thinking about my dad.
That clown?
He left you guys.
I know.
It makes absolutely no sense, but I keep thinking, what does he look like?
You know?
Does he think about me?
Does he have a small group of white friends like me?
Well, have you thought about, you know, reaching out to him again?
I keep thinking, in a perfect world, I wouldn't have to track down my dad and risk getting rejected.
He would just Magically show up.
Exactly.
- Sturdy.
- Hey, Winston!
Looking good.
You don't have to gas me up, Jess.
I've been at this thing for three hours.
- It is all legs.
- Yeah.
Look, I just wanted to tell you something, and that is that when you're alive Sometimes your friends think that you're No.
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
Your dad's outside.
Okay, that's a weird joke.
Yeah, that's not a joke.
He is, um he's outside.
At this moment.
Well, how the hell did you find him?
Well, it was a journey.
Basically, I Googled his name, and here we are.
- Oh.
- Listen, if it would make you feel better to talk to your dad, then I think you should.
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.
I wonder if Nah.
Okay.
"Hey, D Hey, Pop.
"You want to shake my You want to shake my Your hand looks like my hand.
" He'll be like, "What's up, son?
" I'll be like, "Don't call me son.
" - Uh-huh.
- "Don't call me son.
" You know?
"But I love you so much.
I miss I've never seen you.
" I don't know what he looks like.
Or I can tell him to leave.
No.
No.
It's fine.
He's my dad.
I'll tell him.
Say what you got to say, son.
Daddy!
- Get it out.
Yeah.
- Oh, my My God.
- Look at that.
- Look at that.
- Look at that!
- Look at that!
Look at that!
Oh, come on, now.
- Come on!
- Come on, now.
Be feeling like I'm-a stand up in here.
- Come on, now!
- Come on, now.
Okay.
Kids' toys.
I got this.
Okay, I got that.
Go for Nick.
Uh, hey, Nick.
Where are you?
I'm at home making a goodie bag for my favorite little girl.
Um, listen to me.
Uh, I actually I need your help picking up Ruth from school.
Oh.
Isn't this interesting?
Last time I checked, you didn't need old Nick Miller's help.
Hold a minute while old Nick Miller laughs - and says, "Well, well, well.
" - Nick.
Please.
Okay, I Nick.
- Listen to me - Well, well, well.
Looks like you do need old Nicky's help.
Please.
Please.
Listen to me.
Okay, Nick, I forgot my phone at the house, and that phone has the gate code
- that will let me into the school
- Hold on.
If you forgot your phone at home, then tell me this: what are you calling me on?
A stranger's phone, okay?
Ruth's lunch is next to my phone, and I forgot her lunch, too, so just bring both, okay?
Got it.
Also Welcome back, Mr.
Schmidt.
I cannot wait to hear your pitch on the salsa account.
Uh, take it away.
I'd love to.
Thank you so much.
Let's talk about salsa.
It's a sauce.
Or it Uh Uh, I actually have to take this.
So-so sorry.
- Hello?
- Daddy, come pick me up.
Mommy isn't here yet.
What do you mean, Mommy's not It's 2:30.
What is she do?
Okay, um Daddy's on his way.
I actually have to step out for just a second.
You know, in preparation for this meeting, I ate an entire jar of salsa, and it is sliding right through me.
Ah, come on.
Hey, little girl.
Hi.
- You want to open the gate for me?
- No.
No?
You want Let me see what I got.
A peanut butter sandwich?
You want a peanut butter sandwich?
Come here me a sec.
Give me a sec.
Look at this, look at this.
Come over here, eat the peanut butter sandwich.
Open the gate.
Look.
Mmm.
So yummy.
Come come on, come on.
Where you going?
Hey!
Little girl!
Come on, little girl, please.
Where you going?
Ah.
No.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just trying to get a little girl out of here.
I want to be a girl's godfather.
So, godfathers can basically make rules and do things with little kids when their parents aren't around.
- What?
Excuse me?!
- And also, they love me.
- You sick bastard.
- No, no.
- You're coming with me.
- No, no.
Peanut butter sandwich.
Disgusting.
Stop!
Kids love me.
I'm a famous author.
Hey, he's with me.
I'm a parent.
- Parent.
- Yeah.
No worries.
I'm, uh, I'm a parent.
Okay, so what's the gate code, then?
Gate code is four
- three seven
- You're guessing.
- He's onto us, Cece!
Run!
Hyah!
- Hey.
I'm coming for you, Ruth!
Here comes your godfather!
Oh, my God.
Is that it?
- Wait, hold up, hold on now.
- H-Hold up.
- Hold up, boy.
- You got bees on your shirt.
- I got birds on my shirt.
- Birds and the bees, baby.
- Birds and the bees!
- Come on, now.
My boy!
Hey, Aly.
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I heard a man's voice and wanted to know if you were cheating on Nick in the bedroom of my future child.
Well, big news: I found Winston's dad.
In there.
You want to wrestle?
Take off your pants, Dad!
- You know what we like?
- What?
Those two black dudes from This Is Us.
That's not Winston's dad.
What?
I saw his picture on the database at the station.
I know this.
That's not him!
Huh.
Jess, who is that man in my house pretending to be Winston's dad?
His name is Van Bishop.
But did he say he was Winston's dad?
I showed him a picture of Winston, and he burst into tears.
- So no.
- I'm sorry.
Winston was freaking out about being a father and kept saying he wished he could meet his dad.
Of course you can sleep over, Dad.
The couch lets out.
Love you, son.
- I love you, too, Pop.
- Mm-mm.
This is bad.
They are getting closer every minute.
You need to fix this right now.
Okay, Aly, I got this.
If you don't, when I have the strength to wrap these hands around your tiny little neck, I will do so.
And I will smile.
- This is all your fault.
- This is all your fault.
- Don't talk to me, okay?
- No, don't talk to me.
Now you're just gonna sit there and mimic me?
Don't do the thing with the hands.
- Grow up!
- You grow up!
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Are you kidding me?
- Don't talk to me.
- Don't do the Cece to me.
Don't do the Nick to me.
Mommy!
- Hey!
- Uncle Nick.
Hi, honey.
I am so sorry.
You must be hungry.
Right?
No worries, 'cause Uncle Nick
- has your sandwich.
- I do.
I have your sandwich.
Here you go.
You ate it.
The truth is I sat on it.
Maybe I took a bite.
I took a couple bites.
- I ate a lot of it.
- You know what?
It gonna be Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She is going full armadillo.
I need my phone.
Give me my phone.
Well, I'm her godfather.
- I'm not a fisherman's vest.
- No.
What you are is the human equivalent of the cr*ck between two couch cushions.
Grab her.
I'm gonna go start the car.
So, anyway, I'm on the back of a Jet Ski
- with Cornel West.
- Mm-hmm.
And he tells me, "Hey, you're leaning too far to the left.
" I said, "No, you leaning too far to the left.
" Oh!
I see what you did.
I see it.
Y'all talking about Cornel West?
- Dad's got stories for days.
- I bet.
I bet.
Anyway, why don't we button mash this for next week and, um, Van, I can give you a ride home.
Wait, what?
No.
No, no, no, no.
He just got here.
You know, I want to talk about the old days in Chicago.
Never been there.
Garbage city.
Yeah, it has its bad parts, but, you know, the education system is getting
- Wait.
You've never been there?
- Never been there.
You know what?
I totally know what he means, because I feel like sometimes I've never been to L. A. , and I live here.
You know what I mean?
Like, ask me where the ocean is.
"Uh, to the left?" I don't know.
- Should we h*t the road?
- Jess?
What's going on?
Oh, no.
Ruth hasn't been signed out.
Um, excuse me.
Um, have you seen Ruth?
Brown hair, smile that would shake the earth, hates peas?
A white man broke in today.
A a white man?!
No!
Well, what did security do about it?!
- Nothing.
- Typical!
I'm calling Cece.
Go for Brian.
Who the heck is Brian?!
Where's Cece?!
All right, Ruth, let's find something to play with inside this, uh, pillowcase of crap your future godfather brought you.
- Oh, God.
Okay.
- There's this thing.
- Put that down.
- Yeah, put that down right there.
Look at this!
We got an old beeper.
You can pretend to be a-a doctor, or a late '90s drug dealer.
- What's a drug dealer?
- Don't give her that.
Gah, Ma, stop being such a narc.
Okay, thank God you're alive.
Of course we're alive.
What are you doing here?
I went to the school; Ruth wasn't there.
They told me a white man tried to hop the fence, and some man named Brian answered your phone.
- Hi.
- What happened?
- Nick ate her sandwich.
- I had one bite of her sandwich.
Guess, technically, "inhaled" it.
- I didn't inhale it!
- Guys, please.
It's not a big deal.
I'll make her another sandwich.
No, you won't.
About that.
So We're out of peanut butter.
What do you mean, we're out of peanut butter?
I know.
Okay, there was just too much to do.
- And those binders.
It is not possible!
- I do this every day.
You see, that's when the-the Chicago Cubs won the World Series, and, uh, all the players signed it.
I need you to just be careful, 'cause it's worth a lot of money.
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't - Did Nick fix our child?
- What are you doing?
- Just making it pretty.
- You're ruining it.
Your face ruined it!
You're a dumb raccoon.
- Accurate.
- Oh.
As a godfather, I got to push through that.
Ooh, that's work.
- I got to go back.
- What about spa time?
I need to zap my frown lines.
Oh.
Uh, honey.
You know what, honey?
We can do pretend Botox on another day, okay?
Why?
Because Daddy has to go sell a Mexican product to Americans so that Japanese people can make money.
I'm sorry.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Jess, is he not my dad?
- Is he not my son?
Before I answer that, I want you guys to know I had an accomplice in this, and her name is Google.
Maybe I'm a little confused here.
I called you "Dad," you called me "son" for hours.
I sat on your lap.
We ate pistachios together.
I love pistachios.
She told me that you were my son, and I believed her.
I mean, you could be.
The '80s were a blur.
And I toured the country in a Van Morrison cover band.
You did?
Did you play the Portland Rec Center?
Oh, maybe.
It was a wild time back then.
Hide behind a rainbow wall Slipping and sliding all along The waterfall with you My brown-eyed girl You are my Brown-eyed girl I can't, I can't, uh I-I got to go.
I can't, I can't be here right now.
Oh!
- Oh.
- Ooh!
Brown-eyed girl Mr.
Yukimura, uh, I apologize.
- Sell me some salsa.
- Okay, here we go.
Well, what do we know about salsa?
We know that it's a gift from another culture.
Schmidt?!
Are you with us?
Yes.
Uh, it's just You don't know how important salsa is until it's gone.
You keep it in the back of your fridge, taking for granted that it'll be there.
But once it's gone, you realize you can't go a single day without it.
SeÃ±or Cha Cha's Salsa: the salsa that belongs in the front of your fridge.
Sure.
Throw in a dragon with a sombrero and I'm in.
Great job.
Moshi moshi.
Hi, Mama Bear and Papa Bear.
Goldilocks is here with an apology, - and it's gonna be just right.
- Aly?
- Uh-huh.
- Will you please tell Jess to leave?
You're not gonna talk to her?
It's okay.
Winston can talk to me when he's ready.
Baby, she didn't do it on purpose.
It's not her fault that she has zero detective skills, and there's another Van Bishop in Los Angeles.
Which is crazy.
- Her heart was in the right place.
- It was, and should I have let a strange man in the house?
No!
Will it take a very long time for you to forgive me?
Yes.
Years.
Okay.
I get it.
I'll go.
Um I think this belongs to Leslie now.
For what it's worth, you are more prepared to be a father than anyone I know, and that includes Schmidt.
And look, you'll have good days and bad days.
But you'll never be alone.
And just remember, you don't have to have had a dad to be a great dad.
Here.
Thank you.
I won't let you down.
And you know what your mom looks like, so I'm never gonna present you
- with a fake mom
- Mm.
- I'll stop.
- Too soon.
Hey, family, I've been sitting on the curb the last two hours, thinking.
Look, I know I'm not your real dad, but a part of me wishes I was.
You know, you're a hell of a kid.
So if you ever need somebody to play catch with you, or give you the real deal when you step out of line, give me a call.
Nah, dawg.
I'm good.
That makes sense.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Am I still wearing makeup?
You look like my grandmother right before she went insane.
Good, great.
I'm sorry I went overboard with the binders before.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I honestly don't know how you do this every single day.
How was work?
- Frickin' crushed it.
- Oh, great.
- And I think I want to quit.
- What?
Really?
I just kept wishing that I was here, taking care of Ruth.
It's the best job I've ever had.
What would you think if I was home full-time?
I think that anything that makes you happy and keeps those binders away from me, that's what you should do.
Aah!
- What is that?!
Bear!
- Yeah.
And stay out!
You bear!
It's all clear, honey!
I got rid of him
Who can say where the roads goes Where the day flows Only time And who can say If your love grows As your heart chose Coach said he should make it in time for the service.
So at least it'll be nice to see him.
Mm-hmm.
- (sniffles) You okay?
- Yeah.
(sighs) This is gonna be hard.
I don't know what I would do if I lost you.
Who can say why your heart sighs As your love flies Only time And who can say Why your heart cries When your love lies?
Only time Truly insane, this whole thing.
Sorry for the holdup.
Ever since I h*t my third trimester, I've been having the most intense gas cramps.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.
(clears throat) It's hard to believe it's been a whole year since Furguson's departure.
As you all know from my many e-mails and a sponsored tweet, I looked at Furguson as Jewish.
So, in the Jewish tradition, we unveil his gravestone on the first anniversary of his passing.
Furgie accomplished a lot in his time on Earth eating, sleeping, walking around, doing that thing with his paw.
You know, where he licked it a whole bunch?
(chuckles) Yeah, he lived a full life.
Schmidt, will you begin the service?
Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash sh'mei raba.
- Amen.
- Amen.
(indistinct conversations) Thank you, Hannah.
Good to see you.
Just want to say I'm so sorry for your loss.
I made a casserole.
Can I have it?
Y-Yeah, that's why I brought it.
Here.
- Mmm.
- You like my shirt?
- It's got cats on it.
- Oh, yeah.
- A lot of cats on there.
- You know how you like bird shirts, this one has this one has cats.
Oh, I actually wear fish shirts now.
I'm trying so hard, man.
You know, I can't believe it's been a year.
I mean, Winston's handled this really well.
Too well.
He hasn't cried once.
He hasn't had the cry yet?
If he doesn't have the cry today, I'm worried he's gonna have a full mental breakdown.
- COACH: Gooby!
Gooby!
Gooby!
- JESS: Hey, Coach.
- So good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I'm gonna need you to change, 'cause I was really specific about the dress code in the invitation.
Could I say hi to everybody first?
- I don't love it, but I'll allow it.
- Hey, guys!
- Player.
Playette!
- Hey.
- Player.
- Hey, Coach.
- Gooby.
- WINSTON: Coach, good to see you, man.
What kind of adult man wouldn't be here to support another adult man a year after his cat d*ed?
Yeah, I thought it was important to have a memorial.
But you can thank Jess for everything looking so amazing.
It was my vision, but she ran with it.
Well, he was a good cat, he would have done the same for me.
Maybe after you're finished with all this, we can go get you a replacement cat to replace, um What's, uh, what's his name?
Um Cat's name is Furguson, you friggin' jackass.
Hey, that was so not under your breath.
- Oh, sorry, I didn't mean for him to hear.
- Anyway, you know, Furguson was the only cat for me.
I'd adopt one of those Peruvian kids for 70 cents a day - before I adopt another cat.
- (laughter) I think there's a world in which you can do both.
Those-those kids need food.
And why rule out another cat?
Furguson's not always gonna seem irreplaceable.
I mean, it's already been a year.
Uh, a year?
Is a year a long time to you?
How long would you wait before you replaced me if I d*ed?
Okay, this seems like a "on the ride home" kind of conversation.
I am not gonna get into this.
'Scuse me, I'm gonna get into this.
Um, Winston, Aly, do you want to help me, um, hand out schedules for the Furguson tributes?
Um, I kind of just want to sit.
Great, let's go.
Uh, this says 3:20 to 3:40.
I got 20 minutes to talk about a cat?
Yeah, didn't you read the e-mail?
We all have 20 minutes to talk cat.
What a bad friend you are, man.
- What a bad friend.
- You know what?
Keep it up, ham-calves.
You called me "ham-calves"?
- What is going on with you two?!
- BOTH: Nothing.
What did I state clearly in the program?
No beefs.
- Thanks.
- Let me ask you a question.
Uh-huh.
- We're at my funeral.
- (groans) "Ka-thunk" goes my coffin.
Shovel dirt, shovel dirt, shovel dirt.
You wipe the schmutz off your pretty black dress, and stopwatch is ticking.
How long do you wait to remarry?
I don't know, three years.
Three years?
Three year Not even a full presidential?
Your new husband would still be finding my bobby pins in couch cushions.
Uh, h-hello?
Uh, h-hello, everyone.
I am Dunston, Winston's coworker, and I have been asked to officiate this memorial.
- (feedback) - Oops.
Yeah, sorry, sorry about that.
Uh, my hands lose all strength sometimes.
I take medication for it, but it makes my mouth dry, and I wanted to be able to speak at today's event.
That's why I didn't take it for the past week.
Also, I ran out.
So I-I guess I'll, uh kick things off.
Uh, "Pick up hand strength medication" Oh, that's the wrong piece of paper.
- Uh - Talk about the cat, man.
The cat, the cat, that's right.
JESS: Would you look at this?
"Furgusson" with two Ss.
The sca-bozos at the bake shop g*n it up again.
I don't know what's with everyone today.
Schmidt won't stop asking me what I'm gonna do when he dies, Dr.
Sam's wearing a ridiculous shirt, and Outside Dave is inside.
The sky is so close, and it's made of wood.
- You know what the real problem is?
- Hmm?
Nick and Coach.
They're at each other about some stupid thing.
I mean, Coach probably said something pejorative about Chicago football's the Bears.
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah?
In your face.
Are you joking?!
- That's it!
- NICK: Really?
- You want to do this?
- Hey!
NICK AND COACH: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Jess, Jess.
Jess, it's actually hurting.
Seriously, ow.
- Ow!
Watch it.
- I didn't even do anything.
- My arm's swolt.
- That just means big.
No, I use it to mean sore.
'Cause "swolt" sounds like it should be about pain.
- It's onomatopoeia.
- (mocking): "It's onomatopoeia.
" - That's not how I said it.
- Shut up.
You shut up.
You looked better a little chunky.
Guys, whatever it is going on between you two needs to end now, so we can go back in there and celebrate the life of a cat, who, by the way, loved you both like sons.
Now, what is it?
Nick, are you mad 'cause Coach said something bad about wolves?
Coach, are you mad 'cause he still thinks that the movie should be called Paul Blop: Mall Cop?
It should be.
It's so close to rhyming perfectly.
They gave up.
Blart is an actual last name.
"Blop" is a sound effect.
I need to get out of this situation before I get very angry.
What is it?
(sighs deeply) I owe him a little money.
Oh, God, I knew it was something stupid like that.
Coach, pay Nick back.
Nick, forgive Coach.
- (chuckles) - Or you know what?
I can pay you back.
How much is it?
$71,000.
Huh?
And even though Ferguson walked on short legs, he stood taller than any man I have ever known.
(cheering and applause) Thank you.
- (feedback) - The hands.
Sorry about that.
Uh, please welcome to the stage our precinct's acappella group, - LAPD So La Ti Do.
- (whoops) (to tune of "Mad World"): All around me Are feline cat faces Warm cat places Whiskered faces
- (chuckles)
- Nothing?
No?
- Hmm?
- Do you remember these?
Growing more hair Growing more hair With ears up top, they can't wear glasses
(laughs) Furguson's baby teeth.
You know, I remember when he lost these all in the same day.
Yeah, got into my taffy stash, he sure did.
Oh, dip, white chocolate raisins!
- ALY: Oh (crunching)
- No spray bottle (spits)
- Those are cat teeth.
- Cat teeth.
- (gags)
- Cat teeth.
- You can tell cat teeth by taste?
- Yup!
- Meow, meow, meow, meow
- Cat world $71,000?
It happened when I got my first huge Pepperwood check.
Coach wanted to open up a gym and-and I wanted to help.
All right, that checks out Only it wasn't a gym, it was a restaurant, "Coach's Jim.
" J-I-M.
It was a Ruth's Chris situation.
They went bankrupt before they even opened.
- My money was gone.
- What?
Coach's Jim?
What kind of cuisine did they serve?
And who's Jim?
And why did Coach own him?
Anyway, I don't need to know all of it.
Let's just, let's just get back to Furguson, okay?
I can't because this feels so good getting that off my chest.
I need to tell you everything.
No, I don't need to know everything.
I know, but I want to.
Here's the thing this is one that's been bogging me down for a very long time.
Sometimes I wear my boxers backwards on purpose because I really like the snugness in the front, but I also really like the ventilation in the back.
That's right, I'm smushed like a fat kid's nose up against the glass of a candy store window.
(coughs) That felt really good to get off my chest.
What else?
What else?
What else?
What else?
What else?
What about this scenario?
What if I d*ed jumping in front of a b*llet with Ruth's name on it?
I know, unthinkable scenario.
But what if?
And what if she's president at the time, then I've saved the president and our daughter.
Double hero.
You know what?
Just pick a number you're comfortable with.
Okay?
A hundred years?
I'd wait a hundred years, okay?
- Not okay.
Not long enough.
- Are you kidding me?
We'd both be d*ad of natural causes.
Perhaps the correct answer would be for eternity, forever.
I don't need to know all of this.
Let's just get back to Furguson, back to the memorial.
No, Jess, because you don't keep any secrets, so I don't want to keep any.
- Well - Jess, you are always 100% honest.
So it's important that I am, too.
- I mean - No, I want to tell you everything.
I don't want any skeletons on our shoulders.
There's one skeleton for me.
- You have a secret?
- Yeah.
- Jessica Day has a secret.
- Don't make fun.
What, did you eat corn on the cob without the little holders?
It's actually very emotional for me.
(mocking): Oh, it is?
What was your big lie?
Let's hear it.
I k*lled Furguson.
That's why I've spent so much time on this memorial.
One year ago, I k*lled Winston's cat.
(crowd applauds) Uh, next up, we have Nicholas Miller and Jessica Day coming up to read a special Furguson poem.
Nick and I will be performing a series of rhyming couplets about our friend Furguson.
- (applause, whooping) - All right!
(clears throat) Furguson was a good cat, yes, indeed.
Many cat lessons from his life you should heed.
With his proud lion mane and his big fluffy tail I mean, you think you know somebody.
JESS: He ate all his food, even if it was stale.
Struttin' around with his smushed little snout.
He loved playing games and he loved hiding out.
I think I still got teeth in my teeth.
Like the time that he hid in the bag we brought burgers in.
I just can't believe my girlfriend k*lled Furguson.
(crowd gasps) Nick.
What?
Did I say it?
Did I say the bad thing?
I'm sorry, it just kind of came out.
(sniffles) What the man says is true.
A year ago, I k*lled a complicated and beautiful cat named Furguson.
(crowd gasps) I'm so sorry, Winston.
I didn't know how to tell you.
NICK: She's not a bad person.
She just did a bad thing.
Don't try to save me, Nick.
(Jess clears throat) I was catsitting at the loft and I was doing crafts that involved glitter.
There was a glitter sale at Kraftwerk the store, not the German band from the '80s.
And I spilled a bowl of purple, and Furguson took a bite.
And an hour later, Winston came to pick him up.
And the next day, he d*ed.
None of this rhymes.
I did a cat m*rder!
I'm so sorry.
Aw, Jess, come on.
DUNSTON: Let's, uh, keep this thing moving.
Next up, we have, uh uh, Robby.
(applause) Uh Well, I was gonna do an interpretive dance as the red laser dot that Furguson loved so much, but it feels a little inappropriate in the current climate.
Um - I'm so sorry, Winston.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jess, calm down.
I talked to a cat psychic, she said he's in a good place.
But then she also said he's with the cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and I know that cat's a puppet.
So I don't know how reliable she is.
I'm just so sorry, and can you ever forgive me?
Jess, Furguson d*ed of a heart att*ck.
- What?
- Yes.
The coroner said nothing about glitter.
Did you say "coroner"?
Yeah, I had a coroner check him out.
It was quite possibly the most bizarre of my small-time abuses of police power.
Oh, please let that be true.
My stomach has been a brick for a year now.
- I had to go on probiotics.
- Jess, it's true.
I was with Furguson when he passed.
We were in the kitchen.
- Go on.
Tell us.
Let it out.
- (sighs) So there I was, in the kitchen toasting a bagel.
Furguson was on the counter, just watching.
You can imagine what a human toasting a bagel must look like to a cat: pretty crazy.
- Really crazy.
- Yeah.
So there he was, just watching me, you know.
And, um And then he got this look on his face.
And then he stepped back a little.
And it was in that moment that I knew something was wrong.
And then he looked away, and, uh And that was it.
He was gone.
I feel like I'm living this moment.
Oh, and then the bagel was burning, so I had to throw that in the trash.
- (chuckles)
- That didn't get him?
What?
Shh.
(quietly): You hear that?
Hear what?
I hear a meow.
- You hear a meow?
- Shh!
Oh, God, he's not gonna cry, he's gonna go insane.
Wait, wait, wait.
I-I'm sorry I'm hearing something.
I hear a cat, and it is in distress.
There is a cat in the building, and it needs me!
Meow!
Thank you.
Please don't look over there.
- (Winston meowing) - No reason to watch a grown man lose his mind.
- Thank you.
- Thanks for having me.
You have a really beautiful home.
WINSTON: Meow!
Meow, meow, meow!
Here, kitty cat.
You're a baby covered in hair This is the voice I used to use to make Furguson come to me.
Honey, are you sure you're hearing a cat?
'Cause, you know, maybe it's just a little
- voice in
- Baby, it's a cat.
Okay?
I know a meow when I hear one.
Guys, can you help us "look for the cat," so I can talk to Winston?
Good call.
Jess and I will check the back office.
Kitty, Kitty, where are you?
Oh, look!
Cat poop.
Uh, it's still warm.
(mouthing) Do you want to take a break from looking
- for a fake cat?
- Yes.
I hid something in here when I used to own the place.
Check this.
Aw, it's still here.
- Ah-ha-ha!
- Ah-ha-ha.
Hey, I'm so sorry I lied about Furguson.
I just I didn't want you to look at me differently.
Can I be honest?
I think it's kind of hot that you kept that as a secret.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Jessica Day, a m*rder?
Keeping m*rder a secret?
Am I attracted to m*rder?
Well, it turns out I didn't k*ll him, so But if you did, I want you to know that I'd I'd help you bury the body.
You know that, right?
Weirdly, yes, I do.
I do know that.
'Cause it could wake up, and if it did, I would just h*t it over the head with a shovel and then just keep burying it in the hot desert sand.
Wait, why are we going all the way out to the desert?
What's wrong with the woods?
Well, only psychos bury stuff in the woods, Jess.
But listen, the reason I didn't tell you I lent Coach money was, I was afraid that one of the reasons we broke up in the past was 'cause I was bad at money,
- and I didn't want to scare you off.
- Nick.
Nothing you could do would scare me off.
We're in this together.
Cat m*rder and all.
Well, there's nothing that you could do that would make me love you any less.
You know you need to fix things with Coach.
Yeah.
Cat!
Where you at?
Okay, you know what?
Here's my new scenario.
(groans)
- I'm in the Merchant Marines
- Stop it.
I only blurted out "three years" because I don't even want to think about you being gone.
I don't know what I would do without you.
I would end up dragging a lawn chair out to your grave on the Fourth of July and lighting a sparkler, and Ruth wouldn't want to come with me because she would say "Mommy, Kevin's having a party, and I don't want to go to the grave again.
" Okay?
So I'm just alone, on a chair, and I miss you.
I don't want you alone at my grave.
That sounds terrible.
I want you to be with your new husband at my grave.
I want you to find someone who's gonna take care of you, who's gonna love you as much as I do.
I just want you.
Well, it's too late for that.
I-I'm d*ad.
- No.
- It's a waste of time.
I might as well be
- at the bottom of the ocean.
- Stop.
You have to move on.
Uh, hey, Dunston.
- Uh Hey.
- Hey, can you come here for a sec?
- You were great tonight, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.
You did a very good job under difficult circumstances.
Thank you very much.
So I'm gonna die, and I need you to take care of my wife.
Super.
We're fine.
Thank you.
- Okay.
- (laughing): Okay.
Should I join in or just watch?
What exactly are we doing here?
Who wants to begin?
I mean (sighs) I'm not even mad about the money.
I'm just mad that Coach and I never talk anymore.
COACH: What are you talking about, man?
I called and asked you if elephants are basically pigs, and you were like "no," and I was like "cool.
" Yeah, and that was an awesome conversation.
It was also three years ago, man.
We haven't talked since.
I mean, honestly, I'd pay another $70,000 to have my friend back.
I feel like we're close.
Let's bring it home.
I guess I just stopped talking to you 'cause I was embarrassed.
NICK: Embarrassed with me?
You've seen me trip after a shower and rug burn my penis on a towel.
(laughing): Classic Nick.
- It really b*rned.
- It was so scabby.
- NICK: Yeah.
- COACH: It scabbed up like crazy.
- Yes, it did.
- Like a grilled shrimp.
Like grilled jumbo shrimp.
Eh.
I'm gonna pay you back, man.
No matter how long it takes.
I promise.
And to prove it to you, I brought $5,000 as your first installment.
You brought it in cash?
Why is everyone so cavalier about large sums of money?
You just dropped, like, $600.
I can hear him.
Don't worry, cat.
I'm coming to save you.
ALY: Winston, Winston!
Stop it.
Babe.
Babe, sit down, sit down.
Winston.
Baby, I love you, but these meows are in your head.
Okay?
It's because you haven't cried over Furguson yet, and not letting yourself have a good cry has made you a little doy-doy.
You know (strumming lips) It's made you really dumb and stupid, and you're not those things.
Now is the time to let it all out.
Right now, Winston.
You don't have to try to be strong for me.
(crying) Wow, those sinuses swelled up fast.
(screaming) My cat, my cat, my cat.
You know, it didn't h*t me at first, and then, by the time that it did, you were already pregnant, and I just wanted to be I wanted to be the rock for this family.
Baby, if there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I'm the rock in this family.
Yeah, but if you're the rock, then what am I?
You're the beautiful flower sprouting out from the rock.
- I like flowers, so - I know you do, buddy.
- WINSTON: Yeah.
- Oh, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.
Oh, I like it when y'all call me "buddy.
" It's nice.
Also, you can stop looking for the cat.
I don't want to blow you guys' minds, but, uh it ain't real.
SCHMIDT: What?
The cat isn't real?
That's a This is all so Shyamalanian.
I guess I just been keeping things bottled up
- a little too tight.
- (cat meowing) Shh.
Okay, I can't even believe I'm saying this,
- but I think I hear a cat.
- Come on, now.
No, I'm serious.
Listen.
(meowing) Well, I did not see that coming.
SCHMIDT: It's coming from the couch.
(meowing)
- (gasps)
- Aw.
(meows) Oh, my God, he's scared.
Man, don't be scared.
- He loves you.
- Yeah, I'm here, okay?
Baby, he's not wearing any tags.
Which means he's a stray.
- Can we?
- Okay, yes, but only if you feed him from one of those bottles like in a zoo documentary, 'cause I like that, that's cute as hell.
(laughs) Hey.
- You found my cat.
- Well Oh, that's the bartender's bar cat.
I'm sorry, but, uh, that cat's gone.
- Give me my cat back.
- JESS: Wait.
Um, what if we were to offer you $5,000 in cash for the cat?
Oh, yeah, then, totally.
That'd be fine.
$5,000.
Curious, what's the lowest amount you would have taken for that cat?
I don't know, maybe, like, uh, 50 bucks?
- $50.
- Yeah.
- That's considerably less than $5,000.
- Oh, yeah.
Here you go.
I think I'm gonna name him NAFTA.
- ALL: Aw!
- I don't like it.
His name's actually Mitzi.
- ALL: NAFTA!
- (laughter)
(cat meows)
WINSTON: Meow!
Meow!
Ladies, stop stuffing yourselves with pancakes.
Daddy's coming in at a nine, and we're seconds away from being at a ten.
I got Ruth an interview at Lillypads, the most prestigious preschool in all of Jerry Brown's California!
- Ugh!
Lillypads?
- I found out there was an opening.
Uh, the mayor of Malibu's son just disappeared like that.
We're all praying for his safe return, of course,
- just not until enrollment closes.
- JESS: Oh, my God.
Wait.
Didn't you guys already look at a preschool?
(scoffs) You mean Triangles?
(chickens clucking) Okay.
- Ew.
- Chicken.
- Hmm?
- I made eye contact with the chicken.
He knows that I had eggs for breakfast.
Take her.
Take the pretty one.
I don't think that a chicken - cares that you had eggs.
- No!
I mean, I kind of liked Triangles.
Besides, are we really Lillypads people?
- Yes.
- I hope not.
That kind of competitive, overpriced private school, B dash, dash, dash, dash, dash, dash, dash is the reason why I got out of teaching in the first place.
What did happen at Banyon Canyon?
Yeah, what did happen at Banyon Canyon?
You know I can't discuss that until one of four civil lawsuits is settled.
- I know, but what
- No further questions.
You guys, this is crazy.
Look at this beautiful, impressionable child.
Lillypads is the key to Ruth's future.
If she gets into Lillypads, she gets into Willows.
If she gets into Willows, she gets into Harvard.
And if she gets into Harvard,
- it's a b*llet train to the Oval Office.
- Hmm.
Don't you want Ruth to be the president?
Of course I do, but you can do it without going to some pressure cooker that turns her into a robot.
(in robotic voice): Meep, meep, alphabet, meep, meep, numbers.
Have you not seen Star Wars?
Robots are helpful and - often delightful.
- CECE: Please don't start this again.
You two have been arguing about how Ruth should be raised since the day she was born.
SCHMIDT: I'm sorry, I have to.
Okay, if it was up to her, Ruth would have been born in a rusty tub in the Ladies Y.
I'm not letting your hippie-dippie mishegas
- ruin Ruth's future.
- (gasps) This child is a genius.
Yay!
(grunts)
- Oh!
- RUTH: Whoa.
She does this all the time.
Just give her a minute.
- She'll come to.
- Yeah.
- I'm okay!
- BOTH: (chuckles) There she is.
- (Ruth thuds) Oh, my God.
- Okay, all right.
JESS: Ruth!
I turn my back for two seconds and you turn yourself into a cat toy.
NICK: Hey, Jess.
- Hi.
- I'm off to the bar to write.
This is the first day working on my new idea and I have a perfect plan to make pages.
- Okay.
- All right, I'll see you.
Good-bye, Mr.
Diarrhea-head.
- Hey, do you have my money, Ruth?
- (groans) Then we have nothing to talk about.
Aunt Jess, I have to pee.
What?
Oh, no.
We have to untangle you.
Oh.
We're not, we're not gonna make it.
I'll figure it out.
Wait, wait, what does that mean?
- Hey.
- Hey, why is my baby wrapped up in never mind, she'll figure it out.
We just came back from Lillypads and we need your help.
SCHMIDT: We were picking up our paperwork when we ran into that supervillain/wax figure/ former best friend of mine, Benjamin.
Have you gotten your kid ready for this interview yet?
We got ourselves a 365 tutor, baby.
Christmas, New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, we own this man's ass.
W-What are they getting tested on?
Draw a face.
Cut a circle.
Know colors.
Make eye contact.
- SCHMIDT: I'm sorry, hold on.
- (Cece clears throat) I'm sorry, at three?
- How could a child
- (playing tuneful melody)
Is that your boy over there playing the piccolo?
Oh, yeah.
That's my seed, all right.
I had to lay down.
At which point, Benjamin's child started giving me shiatsu.
- Oh.
- SCHMIDT: Which is apparently another thing he knows how to do.
- Ew.
Preschool tutors?
(scoffs) - SCHMIDT: Okay, Jess, Ruth is never going to make it through this interview without a professional tutor.
And if we look past the whole Banyon Canyon debacle, that's you.
Eh, I got out of that game years ago.
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Lillypads was really magical.
The kids wear uniforms and, you know, not to sound weird, - but they look hot.
- That sounds weird.
- They did.
- I hear you, I hear you.
They looked super hot.
Anyway, I have to run to work, so is there any chance that you could, you know, teach her how to draw a face, cut a circle, carry out a conversation Okay, fine.
I'll do it, for Ruth.
- BOTH: Yes.
- Under one condition.
- CECE: Sure.
- You do it on my terms.
What?
I'm gonna have to go on a craft run, aren't I?
I'm gonna need pipe cleaners, glitter, glue, finger paints and six different types of macaroni.
And that's just 'cause I'm hungry.
Honest to God, you don't already have all of that in this room already?
I mean (sighs) Martini time.
I like martinis.
You know, I would be back to writing because I'm kind of in a nice flow, but, say, do you mind telling me that really interesting story you just told me about when you bought those shorts?
I bought 'em.
(laughs) A-And from the start of it, when you realized you needed new shorts?
What was going on there?
You just looked around your house and there weren't shorts?
Not the fingers, man, I'm a writer.
What are you doing here, coming up on me like a maniac?
Um, it's me, Winston.
Sorry, man, I'm just really edgy right now.
- All right, man.
- Working on this thing - about Chicago, actually.
- Ooh.
So you know it's gonna be raw.
You know it's gonna be personal.
- Oh, yeah.
- Also, it doesn't exist.
And if I don't have 20 pages by 3:00 today,
- I'm gonna get punched in the face.
- Who, your editor?
No.
Some guy I hired off Craigslist.
Wait, so you hired a man to punch you in the face if you don't write 20 pages?
Yeah.
I have no idea what he looks like, either.
You know, I would have punched you in the face for free.
- Well, I got somebody.
- Okay.
Well, anyway, I have a real problem, one that I didn't bring on myself.
- I'm just really slammed.
- So, I'm a detective now and I have to testify in these trials.
But you know I get rattled on the stand.
Can you repeat the question?
I asked you if you'd like me to repeat the question.
Can you repeat the question?
Can you have her repeat the question?
- Let's dig in.
- Thank you.
When I was at law school, I-I learned that if somebody falls apart on the stand, it's mostly because they're hiding something.
So, I guess my question to you, Detective, is:
- what are you hiding?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
(laughs)
- I have nothing to hide.
Well, maybe not on this case, but perhaps you're hiding something from your past?
Objection.
Form of a question.
Withdrawn.
Isn't it true, Detective, that this could be the result of a guilty conscience?
I have nothing to be guilty about.
Ladies and gentlemen, are we buying this?
'Cause I'm not.
My question is about the night of January 12.
- Wait, what?
No, no, no.
No, no.
- 2001.
Nick, that is a cold case and I won't discuss it any further.
Well, looks like we're discussing it now.
I was not masturbating!
NICK: Easy, Winston.
You just screamed "masturbating. "
- What are you doing, man?
- Sorry.
(sighs) Okay.
Jess, we have four hours.
(Jess exhales) What are they doing?
- (both exhale) - What are they doing?
What are they doing?
What are they doing?
What are they doing?
What are they doing?
What are, what are they doing?!
We're practicing our breathing.
Oh.
Oh, okay, oh, well, good, wonderful.
So, you're teaching Ruth how to do the one thing she's known how to do since birth.
Do you want to get one of your other teacher friends to prep your child for free?
(whispering): I didn't think so.
So shut your souphole.
Oh, look, it's Happy Sock.
- Hi, Happy Sock.
- Hi.
JESS: See, Schmidt?
We're not cutting circles; we're being circles.
Right.
Of course.
Ruth can't hold a scissor, but now she can twirl around like a goon at a Phish show.
Okay, well, now you're just napping.
We're not napping, we're going on a brain exploration.
I take that back, actually.
Ruth is napping.
Okay, well, that's enough, Jess.
You're sending Ruth straight to Triangles.
You hear that?
(mimics a chicken) That's the schoolyard chickens.
And they're and they're pecking at Ruth.
And this time, they want her eyes.
I need my eyes for TV.
Oh, honey, don't you worry about a thing, okay?
Daddy's gonna take over now.
But the clock is a-ticking, so let's start with a drill.
- No.
No drills.
- DRILL is an acronym.
D: Do it.
R: Redo it.
I: Imitate what you just did.
L: Learn to keep doing it.
L: Live the rest of your life doing it.
DRILL, DRILL, DRILL.
Technically, that's an acrostic.
(high-pitched): Sweet burn, Jess.
Yeah.
You got me.
DRILL.
SCHMIDT: And again.
RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, green.
And that is how you earn a dollar in America.
(quietly): She's not your child, she's not your child Okay, Ruth, we're gonna do the colors one more time, and then, we're gonna move on to a section that I like to call "Get the numbers right, and Daddy will give you a stuffed animal.
" SCHMIDT: Here we go.
RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, Denise.
- Yes.
- SCHMIDT: I'm sorry.
Uh Did you just call green "Denise"?
Yes.
The color's name is Denise.
Well, I hope you're happy.
The interview is in an hour, and now green is Denise.
Green is whatever she wants it to be.
(whispers): Green is whatever I want it to be.
- Huh.
- JESS: Green could be Denise or Juanita or Jerry.
I just realized (laughs) - green is Jerry, for me.
- Green is not Jerry for me.
Are you and Aunt Jess in a fight?
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, we're just telling stories.
Uh, once upon a time, there was a fuzzy bunny who decided that colors didn't need names, and anything could be called anything, and the world descended into chaos.
But the bunny was happy, because the bunny wasn't forced - into somebody else's definition of color.
- Well, the fuzzy bunny wasn't really an authority, now, was she?
Because she used to work at a school where instead of grades, they gave out rainbows.
Bringing up the bunny's past is uncalled for in this cabbage patch.
But the point is: I know about private schools, and the whole system is corrupt.
Said the very fuzzy bunny.
Until the Jewish carrot farmer brought down his mighty shovel.
- The whole system is corrupt.
- (door closes) - What's going on?
- SCHMIDT: Your friend - is costing us Washington.
- Why didn't you marry Shivrang?
Ruth, is that coffee?
- Yep.
- Okay, there is a child here.
I'm gonna take her to the bedroom right now so she can watch local news bloopers.
I don't know why she likes them so much.
They're bl*wing their big sh*t.
Okay.
All right honey, let's go.
Bye, honey.
Mm-hmm.
Talk to you later.
Bye, Ruth.
Great job.
SCHMIDT: Green is green.
- You did this.
You did this.
- You did this.
You did this.
- You did this.
- You did this.
WINSTON: Are we still on this?
When are you gonna let this go?
When you come clean, Detective.
There is nothing to come clean about.
Wait, aren't you 11 pages away from getting punched in the face?
Oh, just answer the question.
Does or does not the evidence speak for itself?
Do I need to refresh your memory, sir?
I didn't phone ahead to warn you of my arrival.
I just thought it would be fun to surprise you at college.
WINSTON: It was fun.
Well, it should have been fun.
- NICK: A man in front of a computer - (echoes): No WINSTON: I was checking my EarthLink.
NICK: With no pants on.
WINSTON: You know my bottoms run hot!
NICK: Tissues suspiciously close.
WINSTON: They were Doug's.
Lotion.
One sock.
Ashy elbows.
Cold left foot.
Look, why am I explaining this to you?
You're the one who's supposed to be writing right now.
You know what I figured out?
You are a procrastinator.
Said the pro-masturbator.
You always procrastinate when something is important to you.
And you know how I know?
January 12, 2001.
- Damn you.
- You drove eight hours across the country to come see me at college, to ask me if I have seen A Bug's Life.
- Oh - A Bug's Life.
The weekend before your midterms.
You son of a bitch!
Big test, oh, yeah Focus.
(chuckles) Oh, I got to pick that up.
Whoa!
It's been a while though, hasn't it?
You should have appreciated the fact that your friend hitchhiked across the country to visit you.
- (both laugh)
- You're a procrastinator.
You want to know why you procrastinate?
I'll tell you.
But you didn't give me a chance to answer.
How am I supposed to answer if not given the chance?
- Fine.
Answer.
- It's a vague question.
It's not a vague question.
Why do you procrastinate?
- I don't know.
- Nick, you procrastinate when something is important to you, because deep down, you're don't think you're good enough to get it done.
(laughing): That's the dumbest thing I've It's also that's possibly true, because that really feels like what I do when I Keep going, you're in a good zone.
So, of course, when you actually get the opportunity to write something about your own life, the first thing you do is choke.
You know how I know?
Well, because for some reason, I'm your oldest friend.
So I hope you get punched in the face today.
I really do.
And then maybe, you'll finally see that you are good enough to be everything you want to be.
You masturbated one time.
I swear to God, Nick.
If I wasn't kicked off of Craigslist Schmidt, you look like you're gonna be sick.
Remember, they've only been on the planet for three years.
Oh, God.
Is that kid reading Jonathan Franzen?
Wow, this place is like the frickin' Louvre.
There's a kid handing out mints in the bathroom.
Well, then, why'd you come?
To see your liberal snowflake - hippie trash handiwork?
- No.
I came for Ruth.
And in silent protest against institutions such as this hellhole.
But it's quicker to say "for Ruth.
" - You are a q*eer little woman.
- Guys, tighten up.
All right?
They started assessing us the minute we parked the car.
- Xiawuhao.
- What?
That's "good afternoon" in Mandarin.
Just a little amuse-bouche for the judges.
I also brought an actual amuse-bouche.
It's a crostini with burrata and tomato.
Doesn't that sound yummy, Schmidt?
Back off, Benjamin.
Your burrata doesn't scare me.
- (laughs) I think it does.
- It kind of scares me.
Ruth, just ignore them.
You're gonna do great in there, okay?
Feeling good?
Meow.
Ha!
She just said "meow.
" (both laugh) MISS CARLY: Okay.
Kids, you can go inside.
And parents, you'll be watching from a two-way mirror, which was a generous gift from a family that's too powerful to name.
(whispers): It's Tate Donovan.
- Oof.
- All right.
Let's go.
- Let's h*t it.
- Okay, you ready, honey?
Remember what we talked about.
ROYGBIV.
Red, orange, yellow Schmidt, she's got it.
Okay?
You're gonna do great in there.
You're gonna bring the heat, aren't you, Ruth?
Ruth gonna do what Ruth gonna do.
- Oh, dear God.
- Okay.
- Please state your name, sir.
- (whispers): So I'm Winston Bottoms.
Uh, Winston I Was Wearing Bottoms.
Damn it.
S-I'm sorry to curse.
I didn't mean uh, that's I know my name.
Let's just get that let the record show that.
When you do your thing.
And um I'm Detective Bottoms.
Are you okay, sir?
Ha.
I'm-I'm yes, sir, I'm sorry, um My lower half has got the sweats.
I'd like to put in a request for a wet wipe.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if anyone has a wet wipe, I will gladly receive said wet wipe and clean off my lower half.
Your Honor, may I request a recess?
Come on, Miller, churn out the magic.
Come on.
Let's get started.
Let's go.
"Nick Miller grew up in Chicago.
"He came from a family.
He hated Winston.
"Winston was really annoying.
In a lot of ways, Winston is still annoying, but" It's supposed to be about me!
Stupid Winston, it's sup (sighs) I'm screwed, I only have six pages.
What time is it?
Mmm 3:01.
3:01.
I'm screwed.
(groans) (laughing) It was you.
Craigslist, bitch!
(laughs) It was always you.
Wow, Stuart really nailed the face-drawing portion.
He included eyelashes and expressive eyebrows.
Must you narrate?
The whole point of the audio-enhanced plexiglass is that I can hear on my own.
Oh, boy, it's circle-cutting time.
Miss Carly is handing the scissors to Ruth.
Ruth is taking the scissors.
Ruth is starting to use the scissors.
SCHMIDT: Don't tell me what she's doing.
Actually, you know what?
Tell me.
Never tell me.
Forget it, this is a disaster, we should go.
Ruth S.
Your circle is perfect.
- I knew it.
- I want to buy her things.
I want to buy her lots and lots of things.
Suck it, Benjamin!
Your bouche just got amused.
RUTH: But what if it's not a circle, Miss Carly?
- No!
- RUTH: What if it's a moon, and it's sad 'cause it's daytime?
What a colossal crap of the bed.
Ruth S, wonderful imagination.
You just earned three tadpoles.
- Three tadpoles!
- Three frigging tadpoles!
Everyone, right here.
You know what got her those three t-poles?
Hippie-dippy mishegas.
JESS: Well, she couldn't cut a perfect circle without your cold-blooded demand for excellence.
Is it possible that after all of this time fighting, that, together, we're the perfect parent?
- I mean, look, you're sweet.
- You're salty.
Excuse me, she lived inside of me, ya jerks.
No.
No, Stuart!
Oh That's an oval!
Oh, well, looky over there.
What is this?
Huh?
I don't love you anymore!
Oval's for losers.
RUTH: Hey.
Your name is Denise now.
What?
No, it's not, Schmidt's kid.
Piccolo!
Piccolo!
Piccolo!
Piccolo!
All right, I heard you.
Too much pressure.
He's a kid, Denise.
- Oh boy.
- Why is she calling everybody Denise?
The whole system is corrupt.
Meow!
(kids all shouting)
(all shouting, laughing)
They jammed the damn door shut with a piccolo.
Meow!
(girl screams)
(all gasping)
(screaming)
(shouting, cheering)
(all gasp)
Schmidt-Stain!
Help me!
(whispers): Oh, God.
Losing confidence?
Nick, what are you doing here, man?
I came to thank you.
I got punched in the face, and I gotta say, it set me free.
Check it out, man.
20 pages.
And they're all good.
Some of them are good.
Five pages are good.
- I really like the title.
- I'm proud of you, man.
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Aw, stop.
- Honestly.
You push me, man, you always have.
I don't know who I would've been if I hadn't have met you.
- Chicago, man.
- Chicago.
Tough love, man.
Chicago.
- Let's go see the Bean.
- What?
I-I don't know.
I don't know why I said that.
- Winston, I came here to punch you.
- Okay.
Punch you with my truth fist in your guilt nuts.
Okay?
And I'm gonna punch your nuts hard.
- Okay.
- How long you been working this case?
Long time, man.
Months.
And does anybody know it better than you?
Nobody.
Then why don't you have the confidence to take the stand?
The problem is, is you still see yourself as that 10-year-old boy who fainted the first time you went rollerblading.
You rolled right into Lake Michigan.
That did wake me up.
But you're not that kid.
You're a detective now.
Married to the love of your life.
You have a child on the way.
Unburden yourself, Winston.
Now, I'm going to ask you one last time.
Did you or did you not masturbate?
I.
Did.
Not.
- Damn it, Detective.
- I didn't.
Detective?
Did you have intent to pleasure yourself?
I did.
(audio slowed): Niiiick!
I did have the intent, man.
But you know how it is when you're a hot-blooded Chicago teenager, man.
- Oh, yeah.
- (exhales) But it's over now.
Wow.
Man, I feel better.
- Of course you do.
- I feel a lot better.
Get in here, man.
Chicago.
- Chicago.
- Chicago.
Detective, recess is over.
We're ready for you now.
I wanted to pleasure myself, and this man helped me get there.
- Aw, you did it on your own.
- Oh, no, you helped me.
- No, you did it on your own.
- (laughs) Okay, I did it on my own.
- Chicago.
- Chicago.
I really hope the paramedics got that piccolo - out of Miss Carly.
- Oh, I doubt it.
The doctor at the hospital said that Benjamin will have a permanent smile.
Like the Joker.
You guys, I'm so sorry.
This is my fault.
I'm just not cut out for this dog-eat-dog private school world.
You should have never asked me for help.
- No, honey, it's okay.
- It was mostly your fault.
You guys made such a cool kid.
I mean, she's crazy and she's strong, and she's going to be exactly who she wants to be no matter what any of us say.
Ruth gonna do what Ruth gonna do.
Maybe we just need to get out of her way.
Ruth, honey.
What school do you want to go to?
Ugh.
That boy is grooming Ruth like a cat.
- (laughing) - CECE: She looks so happy.
- RUTH: Again!
- Chicken!
Hey, you.
Yeah.
Chicken.
- You and me are gonna be friends.
- (clucking) - CECE: Oh.
Well, hey.
- JESS: You came!
(laughs) Yeah, we wanted to see Ruth's new school.
It's dingy.
Daddy, come drink from the garden hose.
(gags) Okay, guys, if I'm gonna put my mouth on a dirty rubber tube, so are all of you let's go.
I don't wanna do that.
- Come on.
- I don't wanna do that.
- RUTH: Drink, Daddy, drink.
- Hello, Mr.
Triangles.
SCHMIDT: Well, ma'am, let me get in there.
NICK: All right!
Get the germs.
- SCHMIDT: Here I go.
- NICK: Drink it.
- Drink it, Schmidty.
- SCHMIDT: Here I go.
Here I go.
- NICK: Yeah!
- CECE: There you go.
(laughter)
(Schmidt gags, spits)
- SCHMIDT: Yuck!
- (rooster crows)
Triangle water is chicken water
- (camera shutter clicks)
- This one I call "the writer's journey.
" - Stuck between two thoughts.
- Mm-hmm.
Lifelike.
Wow.
- What the?
- I'm sorry about that.
- Cooper's my social media director.
- Open your mouth.
- You're the boss.
- COOPER: Nice.
- What magazine is this again?
- Teen BeTween the Lines.
- Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.
- Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.
- Oh, I'm Okay.
- Still in the sh*t.
- You're in the sh*t.
In the sh*t.
- So Oh.
- Really?
I guess this is on me.
- Good.
- I could've gone left or right.
- NICK: Guys, let's take five.
Or as Pepperwood would always say, "Keep your Kn*fe dry. "
- #KeepYourKnife
- (chuckles)
Half that.
- #KeepTheKnifeDry.
- Hashtag.
Oof.
I've got to go meet with my editor.
We're gonna talk about the latest Pepperwood.
Oh, the one you wrote in Europe?
He's gonna love it.
(chuckles)
Way more than the last book he published, Dede, the Girl with A. D. D.
That wouldn't even keep my attention.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Burn.
- (laughs)
Burn.
You got a lot of edge this morning, sister.
Damn right I do.
I'm a working girl now.
Russell and I are building libraries.
He's got me rolling up my sleeves to make it happen.
(chuckles)
Hi, this is Jessica Day from the Schiller Fund.
I'm just calling to make sure this is still the number for a Mr. Marvin Linklever.
It is?
I'll put a check by your name.
When you're done with the "L" s, this is the first batch of "M" s.
Sounds like a lot of busywork.
You cool with that?
- I'm leaning toward no.
- (camera shutter clicking)
I'm listening.
But at least I have time to have lunch with my girl Cece.
We're celebrating me getting this - glamorous new job.
- WINSTON: Oh, hell yeah.
(whoops)
Hey, what's up, guys?
What are you doing here?
Check this out.
Look what I found.
Three Men and a Little Box Set.
The lady and the baby.
- I got to watch this.
- JESS: Winston.
- Hmm?
- How long have you been here?
Not long, like, three, four, five hours.
- Something like that.
- You don't live here, man.
I'm doing a slow move.
- (phone ringing)
- Oh.
Mm.
Duty calls.
(chuckles)
It's Russell.
My boss.
Hey, Russell, what's up?
What you got?
Oh, big meeting today.
Yeah, I'll, um I'll get some parking cones.
- Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.
- I am?
Yeah, still in the sh*t.
Still.
Still.
In the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t,
- in the sh*t
- Hold on, Russell, I just have to crawl out of my apartment.
In the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the Cece, I was up all night trying to put Ruth to sleep.
I'm losing my mind.
I feel like I'm in the third act of a Darren Aronofsky film.
- Cheers, Daddy!
- Yeah, tell me about it.
I'm wiped, too.
I think I put on your underwear this morning.
If I'm being totally honest, I wore your underpants once to a yoga class.
Ruth, do you want to go to sleep?
No way.
If you do, I'll write you a check for $6,000.
Checks!
Checks!
Yay, checks!
- That didn't quite go as planned.
- Yay!
You know what, all I actually have to do is get to this lunch with Jess.
- Which is gonna be really fun.
- RUTH: Let's play patty-cake.
Sorry to talk about a fun lunch while you're at home.
No, look, we have a kid now.
One of us should be enjoying our lives.
(yawning): Yeah, you're right.
We should enjoy our lives.
Go to your adult lunch.
Eat, drink, and come home and tell me of the world out there.
Remember me to the people.
Cece, - I-I love you.
- (snoring softly)
C-Cece?
Hello?
- Play patty-cake.
- I'm trying.
Nick (chuckles)
I don't know where to begin.
I know.
Pepperwood's growing up.
He's becoming transcendent.
Unbearable.
What is this fluff?
You've got two chapters of Pepperwood and Jessica Night in bed eating croissants.
They chase a feather down a cobblestone street?
He fell in love, Merle.
- And then he was reborn.
- (sighs)
And it's sweet when you think about it like that.
Okay, I've seen this a million times.
Your life has changed, and now you've lost his voice.
I can't publish this.
What?
What are you saying?
Pepperwood's over?
Maybe it's run its course.
Maybe it's time to move on to something new.
- You have other ideas, right?
- Oh, yeah, a ton of 'em.
- Okay.
All right.
- So many.
- Great.
- In my computer drawer at home.
Well, why don't you come in tomorrow, pitch me your best three, and we'll see what we got.
No.
I want to pitch you my best ten.
(both laugh)
I'm gonna pitch you three.
Let's make it three.
That seems (gasps)
Hey, girl!
Hey, girl!
- I love that we are doing this.
- So good to see you!
- Celebrating your new job.
- Two hardworking ladies.
Work hard, play hard, work hard, play hard
- Work hard, play h
- (yawns)
Okay.
Let's sit down.
I'm b*at.
Ruth was up all night.
Hey, excuse me, young man, could we get two glasses
- of Chardonnay?
- Chardonnay!
- And a pot of coffee.
- We are doing this.
We are doing it!
(sighs)
So, Ruth is pretty tough, but even if she's not sleeping, at least she's not still potty training.
- Ooh!
- (gasps)
- What, baby?
- It's happening.
Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
- SCHMIDT: Occupied!
- Why is Daddy still in the bathroom?
I don't know, honey.
This'll do.
This is great.
Okay, and
(panting)
(sighs)
That was a close one.
Honestly, I'm just craving some adult time.
Oh.
You're quick with it.
I like that.
Yeah.
We're here to celebrate you.
So, tell me about the job.
You know, it's great.
It's, um, you know, a big office.
Fueling fires.
Making a difference.
Make that money.
I love that.
- (chuckles)
- Mm.
Okay.
Mmm.
Honestly, I'm probably gonna quit after lunch.
- What?
- Cool if we call this your treat?
Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail, baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Oh, man, she's so lucky to have three dads.
(chuckles)
Hey, have you seen this?
- Come on, man.
- These three goofballs just hid heroin in the baby's diaper disposal.
- What a ride!
- Winston, why are you still here?
- Shh!
Shh!
- To have fun.
Why are you here?
(quietly)
: Keep it down.
Ruth is napping.
In my bed?
You put that kid to sleep in Yes, and I changed the sheets.
It's very clear to me what side of the bed you sleep on.
- Busted.
- Ruth hasn't slept in 24 hours, so I drove her around in my car.
She told me she had to pee, so I brought her here.
She nodded off on the toilet.
It was very cute.
Honestly, it reminded me of you.
- That's great - I took 70 pictures.
- But that's - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Are you guys seeing this?
- (groans softly)
(chuckles)
I just thought of it just now.
Three Men and a Little Lady.
One, two, three.
We should do this movie with Ruth.
Winston, you cannot do a movie.
What is that goon Guttenberg painting on the walls?
Words sound weird to me when I'm this tired.
That ever happen to you?
Like, Gu-Guttenberg.
Gu - Gu - Gu - Enough, guys!
- Gu'enberg.
Merle hated my last draft.
He said Pepperwood is over.
- What?
- I'll k*ll him.
He wants me to pitch new ideas by tomorrow.
You can't tell ideas to a d*ad man.
Winston, stop!
Nobody's k*lling anybody.
- Okay.
- But the truth is, I do have something new.
And I'd like to pitch it to you guys.
- He's tough.
- Okay.
- He's controversial.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.
He's pro-choice.
He's Senator Porcupine.
Pass.
Pa-Pass in the room.
- Uh, question for the author.
- No, thank you.
Senator Porcupine how does he put on a tie?
Good question.
Ow!
- Oh, geez.
- Aah!
- (groans)
- Aah!
- Mm.
Mm.
- I don't know.
With-with his mouth?
That's what I'm saying I don't have the answer.
I mean, Pepperwood was all that I had.
Now I've got nothing.
I feel like I'm, like, a wood-maker who can't make any, um
- BOTH: Wood.
- Wood!
See, I don't have anything!
I knew it!
I got nothing!
(door slams)
RUTH: I'm awake!
Hey, I think Ruth is awake.
You think, Winston?
Wait, so, you're saying that you're doing Russell's busywork?
That you, Jessica Day, former principal of an entire school, is doing his busywork?
Nah, girl.
Nah, hold up.
One sec.
How's that wine and coffee combination treating you?
My heart is b*ating really fast, but time is moving really slow,
- so it all kind of evens out.
- Hmm.
Wait, why are you quitting?
He has a couple guys he trusts, and I just get left out of all the major decisions.
- Typical.
- Heads up, you're putting sugar in your wine.
I made a boo-boo.
Let's just No, I made a yum-yum.
- You know what the craziest thing is?
- Tell me.
Every Tuesday, he has these lunch meetings with a couple of guys from the office,
- and he's never once invited me.
- Babe.
- Yes, babe.
- Every woman has a "Tuesday meeting" they haven't been invited to.
How many times in your life have you been excluded from something important or talked over or ignored because you're the only woman in the room?
It was different when I was running my own company, but ever since we joined with GKM, I've had to start dealing with this male-pattern dumbness.
(pumping)
MAN: Ugh.
- What is that?
- It's a breast pump, Ken.
I said I needed time to pump, and you refused to change the meeting, so here we are.
Now, for the jeans campaign.
Which one of these guys says, "I'm having fun in Toronto"?
(pumping continues)
So, for half an hour, they had to sit there and watch me get milked like a freaking cow.
Oh, yeah, your nipples looked like pizza bagels in that thing.
Yeah, they do.
You know what?
This is not the first time
- I've been left out of a Tuesday meeting.
- Mm-hmm.
Remember my first job in administration?
The budget's still too high.
You know, I think it might be the number of field trips we've been going on?
What about the number of field trips?
Yes, exactly.
- Great idea.
- I literally just said that.
I think we're gonna need to take it out of the transportation budget.
Here's a crazy idea.
What if we take it out of the transportation budget?
MEN (chanting)
: Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!
I've been left out of Tuesday meetings - as long as I can remember.
- Yes.
Exactly.
The system is broke, and I can't feel my face.
- Is that a good thing?
- I don't know.
Oh, that belongs in the f*re.
- Whoa.
- Oh, hey, guys.
What do you got here, buddy?
A little room f*re?
That seems safe.
Oh, don't worry, I got this.
(sniffs)
Oh, I should've known that was whiskey.
Oh.
(whoops)
Guys, please let me hate myself and everything that I have created.
That's it.
I have to call Merle.
I'm gonna tell him that I've got nothing.
- My career's over.
- (sighs)
Pepperwood was all that I had.
I'm done.
- I'm three.
- Everybody knows that, Ruth.
Okay, look, Nick, you're not gonna call Merle.
(yawning): Okay, you're gonna go in there tomorrow, and you're gonna do Wake up, Daddy.
You're gonna do an A-plus, perfect-style job.
Nick, you have a ton of ideas, okay?
A lot of i idea notebooks.
- I don't want to hear this.
- WINSTON: Here we go.
Oh, never mind, that's a maze you drew.
Yeah, you drew a maze then couldn't solve it.
You went straight for the wall.
It was a hard maze.
This one is just a list of words that rhyme with "moon.
" But then right away, it's "bun.
" "Moon, spoon, loon, bun"?
The heck is this?
There was no other words that rhymed with "moon.
" - "Tune"?
- That's what I'm saying.
I don't have a Pepperwood was all that I had.
I've got nothing.
You're Mr. Diarrhea Head.
Please don't say that to me right now.
I'm going through a thing right now, so please don't say that to me.
I'm asking you, please don't call me that.
Okay, Mr. Diarrhea Head.
No, you're the Diarrhea Head.
Okay?
Schmidt, what would you like me to do here?
What do you want from me?
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, you used to love fixing my life.
Before (grunts)
came around.
SCHMIDT: It's different times.
I got to wipe her butt.
I got to wipe my butt.
I can't wipe your butt, too.
Can I get in on that?
Never mind.
That's it, I'm done.
I'm calling Merle, and I'm telling him I don't have any ideas.
Ruth, honey, will you please watch Uncle Nick while Uncle Winston and I have a conversation?
Fine.
Follow me.
I'll follow you if I want to follow you.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
I'm coming.
If anyone's the boss between us, it's me.
- RUTH: I'm the boss.
- (door closes)
You know something, I used to think that Nick was the Guttenberg, but it turns out he may be the little lady.
Winston, I need you to focus here.
We have a spiraling man on our hands.
We just need to remind him that he has good ideas.
Do we have any other idea notebooks?
Because this is just nonsense.
I read it, and I don't want to be friends with him anymore.
Maybe it doesn't have to be his writing.
- It could be from anything.
- Hmm.
- Just find something.
- You know what, yes.
Yes.
Um Okay.
Here we go.
"All reactionaries are paper tigers.
"In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, but, in reality, they are not so powerful.
" - That really grabs you.
- Yeah.
- What is that?
- It's, uh Mao's Little Red Book.
The Chinese communist manifesto?
Yes.
Read that again.
(whispering): "All reactionaries are paper tigers" You know what I don't get?
When did I start thinking it was my fault?
Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why am I the one who has to quit?
Yes!
That's right.
You know what?
Tell me what day it is.
It's Tuesday.
Tell me where we're going.
To the Tuesday meeting.
The last Tuesday meeting I won't be invited to.
- Mm-hmm.
- Add this to the agenda, you jagbags.
That's right.
I am drunk right now and very awake!
Daddy got me this dress.
Well, you know, your dad used to, uh, dress me, too, Ruth.
- Why?
- Uh, because he cared.
- Why?
- I don't really know, but he did.
- Why?
- Before you, I was his baby girl.
WINSTON: Nick.
Look what we just found.
A forgotten masterpiece.
You've got to hear this.
You've still got it.
"All reactionaries are paper tigers.
"In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, "but in reality, they are not so powerful.
" And that?
That's just the beginning.
I mean, I don't remember writing it.
It does sound like something I would write.
Just think about it.
You're always saying stuff like, "In reality, they are not so powerful.
" - In terms of the reactionaries.
- Ha ha!
- I wrote that?
- Check that out, man.
That's you.
- That's crazy.
- Let me take a peek at that.
You just need to believe in yourself, Nick.
You've still got it.
It's powerful.
It's v-very it's-it's powerful stuff.
Well, I think it's pretty clear.
I'm back, boys.
- Whoa!
Shut up!
- (Nick laughs)
I'm an awesome writer.
- Yeah, you are, man.
- You're v you're v - you're very you're very good.
- You're the best.
If I were a red shoe, where would I hide?
- I'm going over here.
Ah.
- Oh, my God.
(laughs)
What about back here?
No.
(screams)
(laughs)
You got to be crazy.
(quietly): Turn that down!
Ruth is finally asleep.
Also, what are you doing here?
Did my wife give you a key?
Yeah.
For emergencies.
What is the emergency?
If they don't get the little lady back from England - man, they may never see her again.
- Oh, forget it.
If you're gonna watch that, turn on the closed captioning.
If Ruth wakes up again, I'm gonna plotz my pants.
- Oh, Schmidt, are you here?
Winston!
- Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Winston Bishop
- I'll do it again.
- Shh!
SCHMIDT (whispering): Don't do this.
Shh!
Please.
Why aren't you writing?
I was writing, but I got so inspired by the pages that you found that I drove straight to Merle's office.
"Revolutionary culture "is a powerful revolutionary w*apon for the broad masses of the people.
" Hey, w-what do you call this again?
- Johnny's Big Day at Work.
- Nice.
I have another title for you.
- Mao's Little Red Book?!
- Shh!
Please, voices.
- Mao's Little Red Book?!
- Voices.
Voices!
- You lied.
- Shh.
You lied to me.
Don't look at it as a lie.
- All right.
- Look at it as not a lie, and then and then you're fine.
And now I'm not just a hack with bad ideas,
- but I'm a filthy commie!
- Shh.
Please!
And you know I'm no commie!
I don't know your personal beliefs.
- You don't know my personal beliefs?
- Enough!
Those are fightin' words.
We didn't think that you were gonna give those actual pages to your editor.
We were just trying to inspire you.
Also, why do you own that book?
You see a red book, you buy a red book.
- What do you do with blue books?
- Don't buy.
- Yellow books?
- Wait on it.
- That's true.
- Hi, Daddy.
No.
Good God, child.
Oh my God.
I know what we need to do.
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, my friends are liars SCHMIDT: We were just trying To help you write Guys, you see what we're doing?
We're doing Three Men and a Baby.
- Winston, you cannot do a movie.
- Can't do a movie.
Yes, you can.
You can do any movie except for a documentary, because those already happened.
Harmony on three.
One, two, three.
Goodnight I'm not tired.
- Knock-knock, Russell.
- Who's there?
- Two women.
- Two women who?
- Two women coming in!
- Two women coming in who?
We went over this, Cece that's not the line.
That's exactly the kind of input we've been talking about.
Russell?
We need to talk.
Oh, I'm scared of this energy.
Ya best be.
Ya best be scared.
Is she drunk?
Yeah.
On four glasses of Chardonnay and two pots of coffee.
And I'm drunk on rage!
Knock-knock, boys.
Open your brain doors.
- Sit down, Cece.
- Okay.
Look, I've let this slide too much in my life, but no more.
You may not want me in this meeting, but I belong here.
- Yeah, I-I'm not sure you do.
- Too late, Russell.
- I'm bustin' in.
- Work hard - Play hard, work hard - Can't keep a good woman down.
- Play hard, work hard - Cece, sit.
- Okay.
- You think just 'cause I'm a woman, I can't bring anything to the table?
Well, try me.
'Cause I'm pullin' up a chair, - and I'm gettin' in the game.
- CECE: Ooh.
Okay.
Guys, this is Jessica Day.
Jessica, this is my divorced father support group.
We meet every Tuesday.
Oh, that's why you're crying.
It makes sense now.
(chuckles softly)
Divorced fathers?
Um, my dad my dad is a divorced father.
Your kids are gonna turn out fine.
Sort of.
There-there might be some rough years.
I like your choice of snacks.
(loud crunching)
JESS: Ugh, Russell, I know you're probably mad at me for many reasons.
One you might not know about is that my friend did indeed get sick in the receptionist's desk drawer.
- I just wanted to say - No, I wanted to say that this morning I was ready to quit.
Wait, you're gonna quit?
But I decided not to, because I know I can really make a difference for these schools if you will let me.
I know I was wrong about the meeting, but you have to admit, you haven't given me any real work to do.
- That's true.
- Why is that?
Do you not think of me as an equal?
Because if that's the case, that needs to change.
No, that's not it at all.
Jess, it's just that you're new here, and I've got a lot of trust issues.
Probably from my third wife, Jackie.
In fact, we were just discussing it in the divorced dad Wait, I thought your fourth wife was named Jackie.
I married two women named Jackie.
- Back-to-back?
- Yeah.
They were related.
It's complicated.
Look, I got to make this right.
I hired you because I feel like you're exactly the right person to get stuff done around here.
So I guess it's time for me to just let go and let you do that.
You won't regret it.
- All right.
- Also, while we're here talking, we need some tampons in the bathroom.
Are you asleep?
No.
Well I give up.
This is my reality.
I'll never sleep again.
Tell me a story, Uncle Nick.
Me?
No, no, no.
I don't have any stories, Ruth.
Come on, Nick, you can do it Please?
Nick, she asked for a story.
- Why don't you tell her a story?
- I thought you wanted - to sleep, Schmidt.
- I don't know how to do that anymore.
I've pushed through.
- My body doesn't know how to sleep.
- All right, fine, Ruth, you want a story?
Here's a story.
There was once a magical bear, and he, uh I don't know, walked on a magical tightrope to Seattle.
Have you ever seen a magical bear?
- No.
- Is there a tightrope to Seattle?
Not that I know of, Ruth.
- Ugh, this is garbage.
- Well, what do you want from me?
It's late at night, you asked for a story that's the best that came out.
Weren't you ever little like me, Uncle Nick?
Of course I was little like you.
Don't you know anything?
I was born on a cold, lonely street on the South Side of Chicago.
As rumor has it, and there's no proof of this, obviously, but I delivered myself.
It was my fifth birthday party, there was a knock at the door.
My father jumped up, gave us all a thumbs-up, gave me a wink, then he jumped out the window,
- bounced up, took off running.
- Oh, wow I didn't see him for six months.
My only babysitter at the time was a rollercoaster at a local amusement park.
That and a pack of cigarettes.
(chuckles wryly)
Being nine in Chicago is different.
The tree fell, h*t the power line, and the power line fell right on the hobo, shocking the hobo back to life.
- That was an amazing moment.
- (whispers): Hey.
I don't know, it made me question the existence of God.
I believed entirely in fate, and it was that same fate that brought me to the woman I love today.
Uh, Nick, go back.
Uh, what happened to the hobo?
He stood up, he spun around, he said, "Time to get a job," and he walked away.
- Why don't you write it down, Nick?
- About the hobo?
- WINSTON: Yeah.
- Yeah, why not?
Oh, this is good.
This is really good.
We did it, Schmidt.
(chuckles)
(snoring)
Schmidt?
(continues snoring)
(whispers): Oh, my God.
Time to go to bed, my friend.
Yeah, I think the coffee's wearing off.
- I have to thank you so much for today.
- (yawning)
Uh-huh.
Even though now I have so much work to do.
Yeah, you're gonna k*ll it.
It's gonna be great.
I love you.
I do love you.
- Thanks, girl.
- Hey, can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna brush my teeth tonight.
JESS: Ooh, interesting choice.
- Thank you.
- WINSTON: Come on.
You don't want any of this.
Unhand me!
I'm not even tired.
- Go to sleep, buddy.
- Yeah, dude, you haven't blinked in three hours.
Come on.
(Schmidt yawns)
Cece I love you, but your breath is trash.
It's like a it's like a garbage Dumpster.
Thanks for saying that.
We were all thinking it.
- Yeah.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Time for sleep.
You get one story.
Take it away, Nick.
I call this one Timothy and the Chi-Town Hobo.
- Good night, Schmidt and Cece
- "What are you doing in my box?
It's time for sleep
- Do, do, do, do, do
- "growled the hobo
- You haven't slept now
- "to Timothy,
- For over a week
- "as a muss of hair and a pair
- Do, do, do, do, do
- "of young, sad, brown eyes We hate to leave, but you should be
- Counting your sheep
- "peeked slowly
- Oh, good night, Schmidt
- "out of a
- And Cece, good-night
- cardboard box.
" Good night "
JESS: I have to go.
SCHMIDT: For once in your life, don't be afraid.
(sighs)
JESS: Can anyone help me get in the building?
Jess!
But I hear sounds - Come on.
Come on, come on.
- In my mind Jess, where'd you go?
- Stay right there!
- Stay right there!
Brand new sounds - Hey, Miller.
- Hey.
In my mind (elevator bell dings)
That green light, I want it - (elevator bell dings)
- (song distorts, fades)
Ti amo, Jessica.
I love you, too, Ghee.
(Jess giggles)
(indistinct announcement over P. A. )
- (speaking indistinctly)
- (laughs)
MERLE: Hey.
Bathroom buds.
Get lost?
Look at those horny, horny hippos.
I'm gay for you like that.
MERLE: Hey, man.
Hell of a book tour.
I mean, Pepperwood's European sales are already spiking.
- Hey, have a good weekend.
- See you tomorrow.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
And that's why we're capping off six months of European romance with the most romantic destination of all.
- A three-year-old's birthday party.
- (both chuckle)
Wait till everyone sees what Mama's got on her finger.
- I still can't believe it.
- Me, neither.
"My name is Ruth Bader Parikh-Schmidt, and I am three today.
" Can you say that?
Daddy's butt!
Close enough.
Okay, but where is Daddy's butt?
I got to get to the office.
Daddy's butt has been bleaching all outdoor playing surfaces.
You could prepare a chicken on that slide.
Oh, great.
Well, I got to go help one of my models.
Ooh, don't forget the cooler.
I won't forget the cooler.
Mommy is so good at her job, that she has to work on Saturdays.
Now Daddy is gonna do his job, because these braids are straight-up dock ropes.
- Daddy, do the special braids.
- I-I know.
They're all honey, they're all special.
(panting): Ooh.
I need a break.
Ah!
I cannot believe I let you talk me into this again.
But we got to finish, 'cause Schmidt is gonna wonder where I am.
ALY: Winston!
You rotated the mattress without me?
Again?
That is my job.
Uh, baby?
Listen, you really shouldn't be carrying that.
He's right.
You should listen to your husband.
I'll oh.
Don't eve Just don't.
I am seven months pregnant, and I will rotate as many mattresses as I want.
Aly would prefer that the world treat her like she isn't pregnant.
Oh, which reminds me.
BellyShots e-mailed me.
- Mm-mm.
- Our pregnancy glamour photos are ready, - and we got to pick one.
(laughs)
- (sighs)
So I'm mad at that.
I mean, how'd they how'd they get my e-mail?
(doorbell ringing "La Cucaracha")
- Hey!
- Wait!
Before hugs, we have something we want you to see.
- Uh-huh?
- It's a big deal.
We got in a Vespa accident!
- Oh - (Jess laughs)
Look how much of my shin is missing!
It's disgusting.
Where'd your shin go, man?
Feminist icons very sophisticated theme.
At my third birthday party, the theme was hamburgers.
Well, Ruth asked for Wonder Woman, so I ran with it, because this party has got to be perfect.
You remember her first birthday.
Which led to a downtick in attendance at her second birthday.
His greatest trick was making us remember.
So this year, I invited every three-year-old in a ten-mile radius.
And now you can relax and enjoy your daughter's birthday party?
(laughs)
Yeah.
Uh, sure.
"Relax and enjoy.
" - You keep me young, Cece.
- Mm.
Thanks.
Ten years in marketing, three years in fatherhood and six months of planning this party, I feel like my entire life has been leading up to this very moment.
- I'm gonna go set up the booze.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Booze is a last resort.
It is shocking how much parents drink at these things.
Last week, I saw a drunk mommy take a take a boom boom in the bounce house.
- It was horrifying.
- Ugh.
If you'll excuse me, I see a little boy over there who doesn't understand the meaning of "upscale casual.
" Okay.
He made that Pocahummus from scratch?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, he's never going back to work.
- Can I tell you something?
- Mm.
I really thought you were gonna come back - from Europe engaged.
- Yeah.
It would've been nice if he'd proposed, but you know what happens when we start talking about the future we start freaking out.
If the bird's stomach's full of bread, don't give him cheese crackers.
Can't not say it: love the nose ring.
Yeah, it was a big mistake.
- Huge.
- But not as huge as the neck tattoo.
- The what now?
- Yeah, neck tattoo.
I've been telling people it stands for "Justice Shall Eventually" son of a bitch!
Is that who I think it is?
You invited Russell?
- My Russell?
- Mm-hmm.
My former Russell, my Fancyman?
Yeah, his son's in Ruth's tumbling class.
Russell has a three-year-old?
That polecat doesn't stop.
How many kids is that?
50.
From a hundred different women.
- Figure that one out.
- Russell.
Hey, Jess.
You look great.
Babe, there is a helium t*nk.
Why are you doing balloons by mouth?
Eh, I should've said that differently.
Because I can.
Listen, Snail Eyes, I love that I'm bringing a child - into this world with you.
- That is the sweetest thing That is the only thing I love about being pregnant.
Everything else, I hate.
My butt is sore, my back is sore.
I spend most of my day holding in farts.
So you're gonna have to pick a pregnancy photo all by yourself, Winston.
I would rather look at Nick's shin X-rays again.
I'll go to the car and get them.
Oh, hey, Nick.
Listen, um I need your help picking a pregnancy photo.
They're all so beautiful.
- I can't decide.
- You came to the right man.
Look skip through those.
(chuckles softly)
NICK: Well, there's your winner, right there.
It's pretty obvious.
SCHMIDT: But I will, okay?
Very disappointing that you didn't bring a real monkey.
What the hell is that?
You let him grow a mustache?
- Relax.
It's just a mustache.
- That's not just a mustache.
That's a p*rn star relief pitcher.
I gotta say something.
- I got to say something.
- Hey, Nick.
Hey.
You're gonna tell him you hate it - on his daughter's birthday?
- What do you want me to do?
You know he's gonna ask about it.
Be cool.
Okay?
We'll practice.
(imitating Schmidt): Neck!
Do you favor my moose-tache?
- I hate it.
- (regular voice): You'll be fine.
Okay.
Okay.
- Hey, welcome back.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Good to see you.
- Yep.
So?
- So?
- (Winston chuckles)
See anything new?
No.
- On me?
On my face?
- Oh!
Y-You mean the mustache.
Any thoughts?
(quietly): I hate it.
(scoffs)
You don't you don't mean that.
(chuckles)
You've had a long journey, you need to rest.
Let's talk again when you've had some rest.
All right.
Welcome back.
(chuckles)
All right, man.
Because of a pending Justice Department investigation, I can't tell you why I left Banyon Canyon.
But I can tell you European Jess is a lot more fun than State's Witness Jess.
It sounds to me like you need a job.
You should come work for me.
I don't actually know what it is you do.
God, I was a terrible girlfriend.
Anyway, Nick and I leave for the South American leg of his book tour soon.
In Peru, they call Pepperwood El Gumbo FederalÃ©.
Wait, Nick?
You're still together?
I've been married and divorced twice since I last saw you.
Yeah, well, you know, we haven't been together the whole time.
We've had ups and downs, and twists and turns, but about three years ago, we figured it out and we've been together ever since.
Sometimes it just takes dating your cousin for things to really fall into place.
Wow.
And you're not engaged?
Well, we just take things day by day.
You know, don't want to rush it.
That's right.
You've always had that problem.
I'm sorry, what do you mean?
Well, you and Nick.
You were always terrified of moving forward.
Oh, my God.
Did you ask me before, like, when we were talking, if we were engaged?
'Cause yes, the answer is yes.
We are engaged.
There was a ring and everything, and-and thank God, because it was the only thing holding my finger to my hand for the entire 18-hour ambulance ride to the hospital in Warsaw.
So suck on that.
Right, Billie Jean King?
- This party is a disaster.
- I know.
Our guests have no questions for the panel.
Wait, no, wait, look.
- This is for anyone.
- Mm-hmm.
Daddy's butt?
(children laugh)
(Schmidt groans)
It's just, this is the first birthday party that our daughter is actually going to remember.
If it's anything less than perfect, I'm going to hire a professional samurai - to chop me in half.
- That seems proportional.
Okay, fine.
You know what?
You're right.
- Let's break out the booze.
- Thank you.
Put some toilet tissue in the bounce house.
Vodka Soda-Mayor.
Right here.
Here you go, sir.
A RosÃ© the Riveter.
A Ruth Bader Gin-sberg.
I did that one.
You two have a good time.
Have a good time.
All right.
(cell phone rings)
Oh BOB (on cell phone): Hey, bub.
What's the holdup?
It's been six months since I gave you my blessing.
When am I gonna hear my daughter cry?
Huh?
I think I deserve to hear my daughter cry.
Bob, I'm proposing tonight.
I've been planning on doing it all along - when we got back home to the loft.
- The loft?
You visit every possible romantic proposal spot on the planet, and you pick that dump?
Because it's where we met, Bob.
Look, I've got a whole plan.
I haven't told anybody.
So I mailed the ring from Europe.
So when we're looking at the mail, I'll say, like, "Check this one out.
This one's from Turkey.
You should open it, Jess.
" You mailed my grandmother's ring from Turkey?
I hired an Au pair.
He was going there, anyhow.
- A male Au pair?
- Yes, a boy Au pair.
Look, look, I better get a phone call tonight with the news that my daughter - has a fiancÃ©.
- Bob I don't even care if it's not you.
Okay?
- So you told Russell you're engaged.
- (sighs)
Well, that's simple.
I'll just tell him that I'm engaged, so what was once interesting will now become commonplace.
(groans)
I'm so mad at myself.
But he was hectoring me.
I felt completely hectored.
Forgot about "hector.
" That's a good word, real good word.
Which reminds me, um, may I hector you to pick a favorite?
Hmm.
Aw.
Easy.
- This one.
- Oh, nice.
- (scoffs)
I have to fix this.
- Okay.
If Nick finds out that I told Russell we're engaged, he's gonna spin out, and he'll tell me he's fine, then I'll get a call a week later with him on a bus, crying somewhere, and he's gonna ask me to marry him.
And then I'll never know if he wanted to marry me or if he just asked me 'cause I lied to my ex at a children's birthday party.
- That was a lot.
- You know what?
I just need to march right up to Russell and I need to tell him the truth.
- Yeah.
- I can do that.
- I've been to Europe.
- (whoops)
I can do anything.
- Hey, Mr.
Europe.
- Hey, man.
You know, I thought you were gonna propose for sure.
- I was waiting for it.
- Yeah.
Uh?
Look who it is.
It's Mr.
Sun.
I tell you, I was sure (in slow-mo): that you were gonna pop the question.
Instead, you just sent me a bunch of Instagram pictures.
Pasta, bread, cheese, sorts of nonsense really.
- I mean, I get it, you're in Europe.
- You have to know that's disgusting.
Relax.
It'll soak in.
No, not the sunscreen.
The mustache.
Your mustache is disgusting.
- Stop touching it.
- I'm rubbing it in.
You're just doing the mustache.
Just If you hate my mustache, sir, then you hate me.
That's not true.
I just don't like the mustache.
It never would've happened if I was here!
It never would've happened!
Don't make this about the mustache!
(giggling, whooping)
CECE: Schmidt.
Thank you.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, so, Timmy's mom just started climbing a tree with some very high heels and musical chairs is turning into an adult drinking game.
- Darn it.
- Yeah.
Well, at least Ruth's having fun with Maya Angelou.
Bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish.
Okay, you know what, maybe you're right.
Let's get rid of the booze before everybody goes from children's-birthday-party drunk - to Winston-and-Aly's-wedding drunk.
- -Mm.
Groove on, before you go - (music stops)
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Oh!
Oh, come on, man.
You see, this is why we need a referee.
Give me my chair!
- Russell, I need to come clean.
- NICK: Hey, you two.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Nick.
- Nick, congratulations.
- Hey.
NICK: Thank you, thank you.
Yeah, MagaTween Magazine is calling it "This year's longest Pepperwood.
" No, I meant about the proposal.
Ah, you are such a sweetheart.
Nobody ever talks about my book proposals.
So, thank you.
Some of my best work.
No, Nick, I just wanted to congratulate you on your engagement.
The Rio de Janeiro Civic Center next month.
That sounds cool.
Can I come?
- I'm in and out of Rio all the time.
- It's sold out.
- It's all full?
- RUSSELL: Mm, maybe next time.
Look, Nick, I just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you're finally getting married.
Aw, screw it.
Nick, I'm sorry, I told Russell we're engaged.
- That's not cool, man!
- No, you're Settle down!
Settle down or I'm gonna turn off the music!
Try playing musical chairs with no music!
It's just chairs.
(Winston yells)
What are you doing?
Hey!
- (guests gasp)
- GUEST: Oh, she's pregnant.
Stop treating me special!
Ooh whoo!
- Nick, I can explain.
- RUSSELL: Look out.
(Jess yells)
(guests gasp)
I'm sorry, Jess, she came out of nowhere.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm okay.
I'm so sorry about what I did.
I just, I feel so stupid.
I was just defensive and we're happy the way we are.
I don't want you to get in your head and think we're not happy.
No, I don't, I'm great.
Jess, you do not have to worry about ol' Nicky Blue Eyes.
I'm good.
You told Russell we're engaged, that's hilarious.
- Friggin' hilarious.
- Really?
You're not in your head?
Because you kind of seem like you are.
I'm good.
We cool.
Are you cool?
- Yeah.
- Table for two at the We Cool cafÃ©.
(laughs)
This is hilarious.
- If you say so.
- (scoffs)
I say so.
Cool.
I'm gonna go lie on Ruth's bed and pretend I'm a giant.
(laughing)
: Like a friggin' giant.
Wow, this got away from us fast.
Oh, excuse me.
Where is Schmidt?
What could possibly be more important?
I know why you hate my mustache.
You look at me and see a stay-at-home father.
Just like I look at you and see a globe-trotting author who has thrice appeared on Book TV's - Watchu Readin' with PP Jilbi.
- Yeah.
Have our lives changed?
Yeah, sure they have.
- But, like my mustache - There's no deeper level.
I don't like your mustache because I think it looks ugly on your face.
There's always a deeper level, Nick.
- There's no deeper level.
- There's always a deeper level, Nick!
That's what I'm saying, there's no deeper level!
There's always a deeper level, Nick!
(door closes)
Fine, Schmidt.
I hate your mustache because I miss your upper lip.
Okay?
You happy now?
- (door shuts)
- No, Nick, not happy now.
Happy forever.
Ugh.
I can't wait to lie down.
What?
Are you crazy?
We got all this mail to open.
Let's open it, I'll lay it out.
But it's, like, 4:00 a. m. for us.
And a grown woman just fell on me.
Well, let's just open one to get the mailman off our backs.
- Okay.
- I mean, not that one.
That's not the one to pick.
Pick one that looks really cool and interesting, right?
That one?
Not that one.
I'm gonna open this one.
You want to open an appointment reminder from my gynecologist?
Yes, of course I do.
I like to keep track of you and what's going on with your thing.
So just pick one that You know what, I'm gonna pick one.
Do you mind if I pick one for you?
Is that weird?
I'll just pick one.
H-How about this one?
Oh, this one's from Turkey.
How mysterious.
You want to open that one?
- Sure.
- (chuckles)
(knock at door)
I'm gonna get that.
Will you wait?
'Cause I'm-I'm Just please wait.
Thanks.
Russell, what are you doing here?
Well, I would've called, but my ex-wife deleted all the female numbers from my phone.
Might've been nice to say good-bye to my aunt before she passed.
Anyway, Jess.
Uh, can we, uh can we talk?
Uh, we're a little bit busy.
We're opening mail right now.
It's only gonna take a minute, Nick.
Sure.
We'll be opening mail - before you know it.
- But don't open that one.
It might have a b*mb in it.
So Okay.
- Okay.
Thanks.
- Come on in.
How'd you even know we still lived here?
- I just knew.
- Ooh.
Russy.
This used to be Nick's room, but now it's his home office.
Listen, about earlier today, when I lied about me and Nick Jess, I don't think I can spend another second of my day and possibly my life talking about you and Nick.
Oh.
Most people find us adorable, but okay.
Come to work for me.
I was being serious earlier.
I've spent a year looking for the right person, and I think you'd be perfect.
I know you're planning a trip, so hear me out.
- I'd - Wait.
I don't know what you do, still.
(chuckles)
Yes.
I was going to cover that in the "hear me out" portion.
I think at our kid's party, we go cash bar.
Cash bar would solve a lot of problems.
Yeah.
Coach, listen, I'm still waiting for your vote for those pictures that I sent you, so Winston, just pick your favorite.
Baby, they're all my favorite.
Why can't you see that you being pregnant has made you more beautiful than ever?
You know what?
Fine.
I'll pick one, okay?
Oh, my God, I am beautiful.
Mother Earth.
Creator.
Giver of life.
Give that life.
I'm a walking miracle with magic inside.
Well, I mean, it happens to a lot of people, so it's not really a miracle, but I get it.
Look at that body.
And there's a human inside of it?
- Yeah.
- Why have you been so casual about that?
This is crazy, babe.
W-What are you doing just sitting there?
Get a chair.
Help me get off my feet.
I've got the beginning of our family in here.
- (sighs)
- Baby, can I get you anything?
- Anything at all?
- Yes!
Like what?
- Everything.
- Coming right up.
JESS: Bye, Russell.
NICK: Hey.
Did he like my home office?
Yes.
He said it reminded him of his home office.
Well, that's because I copied his home office exactly.
- Uh, now onto the mail.
- Oh, wait.
He offered me a job.
He's starting an education-based nonprofit and wants me to run it.
But I wouldn't be able to go - with you to South America.
- Who cares?
You should take that job.
It's a big opportunity.
Do you want to open the mail?
Let's just see what's inside.
- Just open it.
- Okay.
I'm wondering if you'll get excited.
Oh, come on.
Sorry, we have to do the cake at your house.
Someone stole all our knives.
- Hi, Uncle Nick.
- And a nightstand.
Uh, I'm sorry, you guys can't be here.
We're opening mail right now.
Nick's really into mail all of a sudden.
You never know what Europe's gonna do to a guy.
Yeah, so Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
You guys will never believe what's happening right now.
Okay, fine, I'll tell you.
Aly is taking a nap.
I was watching her, and then I left, and (laughs)
That's one big-ass cake.
I guess we're gonna open mail in front of everybody.
NICK: Great.
Uh Jess, you want to go ahead?
Yeah.
I just want to say we really missed you guys.
And Nick, I don't need to be married to know who we are.
- Really?
- Really.
I love you, and I love our life together, and I don't want anything to change.
And the moment that someone suggested that we weren't where we should be, I went crazy.
Because we're great.
And why risk messing that up?
We don't need to get married, and that's okay with us.
Right, Nick?
Yeah, right.
(chuckles)
So, let's see what Turkey wants.
Ah, enough of that.
Give me that.
Who cares what Turkey wants?
Cake beats mail.
We got a hungry birthday girl right here, I don't want to bore her - with foreign mail.
- I like mail.
Oh, you don't know what you like.
You're three years old.
(chuckles)
Excuse me.
I got to go wash my hands.
I've been in Europe.
SCHMIDT: Is he suggesting that he hasn't washed his hands since Europe?
Bob, I can't do it tonight.
(groans)
I'm sorry, but this thing has been ten years in the making, and everything about the proposal has to be perfect.
- And I'll know when the time is right.
- You know what?
I'm rescinding my blessing.
You want to marry my daughter?
You got to resubmit for a new blessing.
And it better be as good as the first time you asked.
(sighs)
Okay.
Bob, I am in love with your daughter, and I will be for the rest of my life.
I want to ask her to marry me, but only with your blessing.
All right, all right.
Yeah, y-you got it.
But this time there's a time limit on it.
One month.
You hear me?
- One month!
- One month.
ALL: Happy birthday Dear Ruth Happy birthday to you (all cheer)
- (laughs)
- Good job, baby.
- Hey, hey.
- Good job.
Never lived for nobody But I live for you Ooh Babe, lost in love Is what I feel When I'm with you Maybe it's the way you touch me With the warmth of a sun Maybe it's the way you smile I come all undone Ooh, baby It's so great having everyone back in the loft.
I hope this never ends.
Feel When I'm with you
So, I've got it all planned out.
I'm gonna surprise Nick at his book reading, and afterwards, when he's on a big high, I'm gonna tell him how I feel.
You think this is a little soon after the breakup with Reagan?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm worried, very worried.
(chuckles)
But you know what, I wrote everything out on the plane, like what I'm gonna say.
It's all on flash cards, some of it's in song, I would do it for you, but some of the jokes are at your expense, - so, uh - (chuckles)
Jess, why don't you just tell him how you feel?
You know, no jokes, no songs, just from the heart.
(laughs)
No songs.
- (laughs)
- Yeah.
No songs.
No songs, she said.
- NICK: "Pepperwood lay on the ground - "in a puddle of blood.
"Jessica Night broke through the barricades and ran to his side.
"'Even though he doesn't have muscles, "he seems incredibly strong' Jessica thought, "as she looked into his perfect, sexy face.
"Even now, even covered "in the blood of the man they both knew as Schmith, "the two sat in silence in the hot, New Orleans night, "waiting for the words that would never come.
" (audience whoops and cheers)
I'm gonna open up the floor to some questions.
Uh, the young lady right here in the strange-looking vest.
No offense.
When are Pepperwood and Jessica Night going to get together?
- WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That is a great question.
(audience muttering)
I'll just cut to it, guys.
Uh, Pepperwood and Jessica Night will never get together.
Never.
(low murmuring)
I'm sorry.
You guys, stop.
It's just, look, these characters, they-they are based off real people.
A-and the real people are just fundamentally different.
They don't work together.
It's just never gonna happen.
- You just got to forget about it.
- Excuse me.
Move on from it.
And also, you know, Pepperwood, he blew it.
Sometimes you don't get another chance, you know, to-to fix the mistake.
It's just look, adult relationships are really complicated.
So, let's hear it for books!
All right, wow, you guys are super intense.
Hi.
- I'm Merle Streep.
- I don't care.
Okay.
Um, I'm an editor and I publish children's books, - so I wanted - Oh, congratulations to you.
What would you like me to do about that?
Uh, I'm about to make a call, so - Nice to meet you, Merle Streep.
- (line ringing)
- Goofy name.
Okay.
- I'll I'll okay.
(ringing)
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, this is crazy, but were you just at my reading?
You're not in L. A. , are you?
No, I'm in Portland with my dad.
- That's what I thought.
- How'd the reading go?
Couldn't have gone better.
I felt weirdly comfortable up there.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.
Reagan and I broke up.
I got to go.
Oh, my dad just sprained his thumb trying to get up off a couch.
I'll talk to you later, Nick.
Sorry.
So, is now a good time to talk to you?
Because I'd like to talk to you about publishing your book.
You'd like to talk to me about what?
Publishing your book.
What are you, some kind of a-a publisher?
Yeah, that's what my card I was trying to give you my card, but you - You want to publish my book?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I want you to publish my book.
- Is this how you normally are?
- No.
(humming)
(whoops)
Babe, hi.
Are your pants off?
I I went to the reading and Oh, no, what happened?
I'm so sorry I'm not wearing pants.
Schmidt's been so busy with work, we scheduled a no-pants dinner thing.
Do you want me to take my pants off, too?
Oh, no, honey.
Tell me everything.
ALY: That's it.
I'm all moved in.
This is my last box and it's labeled "holiday important.
" So, it's definitely sex toys.
(laughs)
Well, then I wonder what's in this box.
It's labeled "documents.
" Eh, it's just documents.
(chuckles)
Oh, no, no, no.
That's nothing.
- I - Wait, wait, wait.
You have a mug sh*t of the diaper bandit?
- With a phone number on the back?
- All right.
Listen, I-I wanted to wait for the right time to tell you this.
Have you been keeping in touch with the diaper bandit?
What?
No.
No, listen.
I That's actually your dad's phone number.
You said you wanted to find him, so I found him.
(whispering): My dad is the diaper bandit?
- No.
- Oh.
- Forget about the diaper bandit.
- That'd have been weird.
SCHMIDT: Cece (singsongy): I'm not wearing any pants.
(whispering): Honey.
- (screaming)
- Oh, no!
Oh, no!
I touched one of your breasts!
Where is my wife?!
I can never be the same!
(both panting)
- Let's just move on.
- I'm fine.
No, it's fine.
I panicked, and I told him I was in Portland, and now I can't go back to the loft.
To play devil's advocate, he was just talking about characters in his novel.
I mean, look, the character based on me is a Jewish psychopath who wears a bolo tie and eats applesauce out of a baboon's skull.
No, he was talking about us.
He just doesn't feel the way I feel.
I I can't see him.
Hey, it's me, Nick.
In three, two - Hang on, wrong key.
- SCHMIDT: Get in the kitchen.
- Go, shoo, scram.
- NICK: That was for my chest drawer.
- Got it.
- SCHMIDT: My man.
(Nick sighs)
I don't love this couch.
Did you take the tags off already?
It's the perfect couch.
What are you doing here?
Well, I need to talk to you and my phone's only at five percent.
- Well, why didn't you - I can't find the charger.
- It's under Winston's pillow.
- I looked in Winston's room.
- Did you look under the pillow?
- Yeah, yeah.
I - Yeah.
I went in there.
I - No, you didn't.
I didn't look in Winston's room, but I need to talk to you.
An editor wants to publish my book.
Pass immediately and start a bidding w*r.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Mazel.
- That's incredible, Nick.
- Thanks.
I called Jess, but she didn't answer.
I was really hoping to tell her about it, but she hung up on me earlier and now she won't pick up the phone.
- What are you doing?
- Shh!
Shh, shh!
(whispering): What, what, what?
- Oh, Nick's here?
- Shh!
You're yelling.
- I'm not yelling.
- You're yelling.
You're coming with me to the meeting tomorrow.
(phone beeps)
I'm picking you up at 9:00 A. M.
- I have to go to the kitchen.
- I'll come with.
I'm starving.
No.
Where are you Come to the kitchen with me then, Nick.
(whispering): Wait, why are you crawling?
(whispering): I don't know.
Just go.
(groans)
- Hey, do you have any - (phone beeps)
angel hair pasta in here?
I don't see it.
Ooh, you know what?
Uh.
excuse me, I have to go to the bedroom now.
(quietly): Jess, this is very stressful.
I know.
Look, tomorrow, you need to go to that meeting with Nick and you need to stay with him until I'm packed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, packed?
- I just army-crawled across your entire house to get away from my ex-boyfriend who I still live with.
I-I can't do this anymore.
I need, I need to get out of here and get some space.
I'm moving out of the loft.
What?
I couldn't find your trash bin, so I threw it away in the toilet.
- What'd you throw in the toilet?
- The, uh, salami in the fridge.
- What?
- I didn't flush it.
So, you're gonna have a bunch of salami floating around in your toilet bowl.
What?
So Jess is just moving out because Nick said something dumb at a reading?
Nick is always dumb.
He's the dumbest boy in school.
I had no idea you cared so much about what happens to Nick and Jess.
How could I not?
I've been watching these idiots do this dance for the last six years.
He's rough and tumble.
She's sweet and sassy.
It's the moon and the tides, it's the push and the pull.
I know, it just makes so much sense.
I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him.
I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him, I'm gonna burst in the door, and I'm gonna say, "Nick, she loves you," and then No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We cannot get involved.
Okay.
- Okay?
- You're right.
- You're right, okay.
- All right.
Okay.
(both sigh)
- I should've worn shorts.
- No, no.
I would've looked amazing in shorts.
I got rid of all the shorts, you nut-ball.
You are really grumpy this morning.
Well, I was up late last night, - talking to Cece about you.
- For what?
Nick, I want to tell you something, but but I can't.
So I'm just gonna ask you this: why on earth do you think that you are so okay with this Reagan breakup?
Reagan and I are at different places of our life.
It's fine.
Why hasn't Jess called me back?
You guys are pretty good friends, right?
But if you remember correctly, you didn't even want Jess to move in to the loft.
Nick, why do you think that is?
I'm pretty freaked out by sanitary napkins.
Why don't you think you wanted Jess to move in to the loft?
I don't know, 'cause I, 'cause I was afraid.
Nick, you have been in love with this girl from the moment you opened the door and you first laid eyes on her.
I have never seen you look at anyone else like that in my entire life.
Except maybe, on a few occasions, me.
I've never looked at you the same way I look at Jess.
- There's been a few times.
- I there's never been a time.
You looked at Coach maybe once or twice like that.
Me, several times.
Winston, never.
Let's table it.
You're wrong.
The first time I saw Jess was I was standing in her empty room, and I was looking out the window.
- She was trying to get in the building.
- Okay.
Pretty hilarious.
She didn't have her glasses on, and she was bumping into stuff.
Will you listen to yourself?
I shouldn't be telling you this, but Jess is not in Portland.
She's here.
And she's packing up her stuff because she's going to move out of the loft for good.
Nick.
Wait, she's gonna move out of the loft?
For once in your life, don't be afraid.
Ready to come in and talk?
Hello.
I'm, uh, Winston Schmidt, Nick's associate.
That's right.
Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.
What?
Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.
Don't say that here anymore, okay?
Thank you.
So sorry I'm late, but Sadie would not stop going on about her divorce, and I was like, "Girl, can you just be quiet "and look at my vag*na, please?" The fact that we have the same gynecologist really makes me feel closer to you.
Wait, is this all you have packed?
I mean, Nick's gonna be here in two hours.
- I know.
- Hey.
You know what?
If this is too hard right now, you don't have to do this.
Just give yourself some time and think it through.
If my stuff is here, I'll just end up living here again.
You know me; I live where my stuff lives.
When I come back for the school year, I'll find a new place.
All right.
Well, if we're gonna do this, then we better get moving.
Yep.
My God, I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm gonna miss you so much, too.
But it's just one summer.
It's fine.
Okay, I know, but I'm just gonna miss you.
Me, too.
- This is dumb!
- It's one summer.
- It's one summer.
- It's one summer.
It's fine.
We can get through one summer.
It's fine.
I'm gonna miss you, like, day-to-day.
Who am I gonna talk to every day?
Mine, mine is this mine?
Are you collecting things for Goodwill?
I'm not donating things, I'm moving out.
BOTH: What?
Look, I'm just going to Portland for the summer to get away.
Sure.
You go to Portland, have a fun summer, but then what about after that?
Huh?
When will we see you?
Who will your friends be?
Who you gonna hang out with?
Okay, think about the people you are leaving behind.
Also, side note, Aly has my dad's number!
- Okay.
- Wait, what?
- I got his dad's number.
- My dad's name is Van, by the way.
Oh, my God, Winston, that's a huge deal!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Are you gonna call him?
No.
I can't call my dad.
I just can't.
You know what?
You don't have to call him if you don't want to.
You can always just escape to Portland Oh, my God!
You can come with me to Portland!
Furgie's gonna love it.
It's the second most cat-friendly Portland after Portland, Maine, according to Paws magazine.
- Are you going to Portland?
- No.
Portland is hella white.
(phone ringing)
Ooh.
(chuckles)
Sadie.
Hello.
(singsongy): Cece, you're pregnant.
Oh, my God Cece's pregnant.
Why are you picking up someone else's phone?
Call back in five minutes, and we will agree to lie to our friend for the rest of our lives.
Oh, God.
You're gonna be in my office throughout the pregnancy, aren't you?
(door closes)
So I am double-parked, so if you got any boxes I can take down to the car.
What's up?
Why are you so happy?
I just love boxes so much.
Can I have one to take to the car?
- It's heavy.
- I'm fine.
Oh, okay.
We can go together.
That's fine.
I-I like quality time.
(phone ringing)
- Oh, you should go get your phone.
- No, no, no.
Let's just get this box down.
- Okay.
- Hey, can someone grab my phone?
What if it's about your booming model business?
- ALY: Hello?
- Cece, you're pregnant!
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant!
- Who the hell is this?
- Cece's pregnant?
Sorry.
I-I'm Aly, Winston's fiancÃ©e.
Cece is pregnant?
- Winston's married to Cece.
- Winston Bishop.
Cece's pregnant.
Cece's pregnant.
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant, everybody!
- Oh, my God.
- (laughs)
No need to yell.
Tell Cece to call me.
Got to head back down in the mine.
Hey, can we hustle?
I got a hair appointment in an hour.
It's a real upstairs, downstairs kind of day.
Gotcha.
(ringing)
What, Winston?
I'm using social media.
Oh, my God, Schmidt.
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be a papa?
No, no, no, no.
What do you mean, "papa"?
What are you talking about?
- Pull the plug.
- Sadie told Aly that Cece is pregnant.
- Pull the pull the plug.
- What?
Why would she do that?
- 'Cause she pregnant.
- Winston, he doesn't know.
Oh, oh, oh, no Ah No I messed up just now.
W-Winston.
You weren't supposed to know that, so don't know that.
- Is that true?
What's going on?
- Hey, Schmidt.
It's Jess.
I'm so sorry.
I picked up Cece's phone, it was Sadie, and she told me the news, and now everybody knows but Cece.
So I'm gonna send her home.
Okay, okay, but Jess, um Plea (sighs)
Is it true?
Yeah.
It's true.
Just get home.
She needs to hear it from you.
Miracle of miracles!
Finally got a parking spot.
Why y'all just staring at me?
Just really happy you found that spot.
Man, people wait their whole lives looking for a spot.
Thank you.
And here, you've been blessed.
With a spot.
MERLE: Okay, so I do have a few changes.
Take or leave.
What if we k*ll off Jessica Night in the next book?
What?
I was thinking that she could be Schmith's next victim.
We could do it in a big way, like, he drops a piano on her head.
- (bl*ws raspberry)
Done-zo.
- What?
Maybe she takes a baseball right to the face.
Batter out!
- Have you ever done this before?
- Yes, actually.
I published the entire Bitch Witch series.
Bitch Witch Christmas, Bitch Witch Prom Night, - and Bitch Witches of Rhode Island.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Look, Nick, I-I get that you're afraid to make changes.
Actually, I'm not afraid.
- Okay, then you'll think about it.
- (chuckles softly)
No, I'm not gonna make those changes because those-those ideas are really bad.
- Well, I - Jessica Night is the whole reason Pepperwood gets out of bed every day.
NICK: Schmidt?!
You were right!
Schmidt?
Uh, he had to go, but he left the name and number of his favorite Uber driver, uh, Beezus "The Man" Tequito.
All right.
Mr. Beezus.
Mr. Schmidt likes to party.
You like to party?
Oh, very cool lights.
But, no, uh, Beezus, I I don't like to party It's not the first time I've heard that.
I'm gonna go see a girl.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
Sure, yeah, that could be inspiring.
Hot cross buns Hot cross buns One a penny, two a penny Hot cross buns Second chorus.
Hot cross buns Yeah, I cannot believe Schmidt likes this.
Good when they're old But eat them when you can They're not as good when they're cold Hot cross buns (sighs)
WINSTON: Last box in the truck.
Mm.
I haven't seen this room this empty since Steve left.
Who's Steve?
Oh, he was the guy who lived in this room before Jess.
Real night screamer.
He couldn't sleep unless he was screaming a whole bunch.
Yeah.
Oh, I guess I should give you my keys.
Are you really not gonna tell Nick how you feel?
- That's such a Steve move.
- (chuckles)
Steve was in love with Nick?
Oh, yeah, and he never told him.
That sweet, gay coward.
Maybe Steve left this place and-and and finally got the space that he needed to become a better version of himself.
Yeah, I mean, he's selling tires in Little Rock.
Okay, well, forget Steve.
Look, I know I'm being a coward.
Jess, I know you.
You can't walk away without talking to him.
This is how I have to move on, and I have to go.
- Let's get on the road.
- Okay.
Wait.
(sighs)
(line ringing)
VAN (recorded): You've reached Van.
Leave a message.
(beep)
Hello, Van.
This is Winston Bishop.
I'm your son.
I'm calling to tell you that I am getting married to the most amazing woman in the world.
And I turned out pretty great, too, so, um call me whenever you're ready.
Oh, also, I have a cat.
He's not ready to have a relationship with you, so just don't try to force it on him.
(phone beeps)
Yeah, so now it's your turn.
Be brave.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Hey, babe, I'm back.
Whew!
(sighs)
What's, uh what's happening?
I'm pregnant.
- What?
- I mean, you're pregnant.
We're pregnant.
(chuckles)
Sadie called you, and-and Jess picked up, then she called again and Winston picked up, Winston told me.
It's an upsetting scene, but, um, we're having a baby, Cece.
I wanted to buy you flowers, but I couldn't pick out which ones, so We're having a baby?
We're having a baby.
(whispers): We're having a baby.
I really didn't think it was gonna happen for us.
It's a caramel miracle.
(both laugh)
BEEZUS: Don't forget to give me five stars!
NICK: Three and a half!
Thanks, Beezus!
Hey, let's turn on some music.
(radio stations changing)
- Oldies station okay, everybody?
- The time of my life I think I'd be really happy working as a mover.
I like the gloves, I like the excitement.
It's the truth And I owe it all to you Sit back and watch the job get done.
Winston's right.
Portland, huh?
Land of the muskrat.
- Pull over!
- I mean, I'm in the middle - Just pull over.
- We're in traffic and we're parked!
I was just trying to, you know okay, I'll go up.
I'll go up a few blocks, that's fine.
Jess?
(sighs softly)
JESS (outside): Can anyone help me get in the building?!
Hey, dog!
Can you bark for someone?
Bark, dog!
Bark!
(imitates dog barking)
Ah!
Screw you.
Can anyone help me get in the building?!
I gave away my key!
Anyone?
Jess!
Hang on, I'm coming down!
(sighs)
Oh, hey, hold the door.
Thanks.
(dog barking)
Now you find your voice?
But I hear sounds in my mind Come on, come on, come on.
Brand-new sounds in my mind Come on.
But, honey I'll be seeing you Ever I go (grunts)
But, honey, I'll be seeing you Down every road Jess, where'd you go?!
- Jess!
- Nick!
Why are you down there?
BOTH: Stay right there!
'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things - Come on, come on.
- But I can't let go I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Oh, I wish I could get my things And just let go Oh, come on, please go faster.
I gotta tell my best friend I'm in love with her.
Shower first.
I've never seen anyone sweat so much.
You take a shower.
You smell terrible.
- You smell terrible!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)
Hey, Miller.
Hey.
That green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light
The dream is d*ad.
Say good-bye to the Schmidt Charitable Trust.
I don't know what that is.
But is that why you were throwing light bulbs against our garage?
- That was unrelated.
- Oh.
It's the foundation that I was going to establish to take the Schmidt brand to the next level, but now I can't.
- The name is taken.
- What?
Get a load of that.
The Schmidt Charitable Trust was established in 1948 by Cranston Schmidt, to promote nudity in restaurants.
Cranston Schmidt and his naked waitresses.
What am I supposed to do now?
How can I show my peers that I make so much money that I could just throw it away on strangers?
There is one way that you could maybe solve your problem.
- What?
- You could use your first name.
What did you say?
You are not a frat boy drinking at a keg anymore, okay?
You are an executive now.
- You're a baller.
- I am a baller.
Also, I was never allowed in frats.
Too much hazing that required a visible penis.
- Oh, baby.
- JESS: Just do it.
- (shouts)
- Like, who cares?
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough, Schmidt.
Yeah, we keep the camera running all day.
I'm trying to keep Jess company while she's in Portland.
Yeah, yesterday I watched Cece read for a while.
Oh, wow, that sounds like fun, Jess, good for you.
- Cece - Jess needs us right now.
She's still mopey over Nick.
I'm not mopey.
I'm rad.
I'm gleaming the cube.
She's lying.
She's a wreck.
JESS: Ugh, Dad!
Ugh, I'm on the phone!
You're so embarrassing.
All he does is just recycle cans all day.
I wish his child bride would come back from Denver so he'd have someone else to bother.
Let's just get you out of this house.
- Yeah, right.
- Well, what are you going to do?
You're gonna sit on this couch all day long?
You'll get sofa butt.
Come on, let's go get some ice cream.
Ugh, I hate ice cream.
Dad!
- Nobody hates ice cream.
- It's stupid.
- I-I feel uncomfortable watching this.
- Yeah, it's stupid, Dad.
It's so stupid.
- Hey, Cece.
- Dad.
Hi, Schmidt.
How are you?
Dad!
Don't talk to my friends!
(Nick clearing throat)
Achoo!
(shushes)
(clears throat)
- Oh, you're up.
- You woke me up.
Hey, do you mind if I run something by you that's very personal, very hot button?
I do I need to rest.
- I'm working nights this week.
- Oh, as a police officer?
No, Nick, as a prost*tute.
Yes, as a cop.
Now will you please leave my room?
I'm very tired and I need to get some rest.
I understand, but here it comes, I have to tell you.
- I don't want to hear it.
- Aly, I'm gonna tell you.
- I swear to God.
- I need to break up with Reagan - but I don't know how to.
- Damn it, Nick.
Oh, now you're involved.
So now that you're involved, we need to talk it out 'cause we're basically partners in this.
- We're not partners.
- Things with Reagan and I haven't been working out, and last night it really came to a head.
It's just crazy.
You know, - I was just driving down the - Mm-hmm.
Sounds crazy.
- Reagan.
- Yes?
I worked all day.
We haven't seen each other.
Don't you want to catch up?
(sighs)
Yes.
(clears throat)
Fine, what?
What happened to you today?
I saw a seagull in the backseat of a moving car.
Can we have sex now?
Ugh, you don't get it.
Let's get it over with.
What does this have to do with me?
I was hoping you'd tell me how to break up with her.
Just pretend you're an adult - and get it over with.
- Yeah.
Train's already left the station, Nick.
The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.
The train already left the station, huh?
- Yep.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, say, wake up.
Question.
Excuse me.
Yes, Nick?
Do you think that looks like a monster's butthole?
I kind of do, yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
It's really gross.
What's going on, Schmidt?
Man, are you having trouble ordering from that Jamaican restaurant again?
I don't know how many times I got to tell you.
Don't walk in there using their accent 'cause it's kind of r*cist.
The time has finally come for me to launch my own brand.
- Are you really not gonna turn around?
- Not yet.
This brand will be my legacy.
And this is where you come in.
Ooh!
You had that timed right!
I'm going to start using my first name again.
Schmidt, I think that is a very bad idea.
I have no choice!
When I was born, my parents gave me a name.
Don't do this, Schmidt.
Ain't nothing but pain down that road.
It is the name that I was called for most of my life, and I want my name back.
Isn't this fun?
Remember, we used to come here all the time, every time you won a tennis match.
- That was your other daughter.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
You-You were always in a production of Annie, but never Annie, though.
Priscilla, come here, come here.
I want you to meet my daughter, Jessica.
Remember?
I told you about her.
She's the one that doesn't play tennis.
Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.
(laughs)
Well, two rum raisin sundaes and whatever my daughter wants.
(Priscilla and Bob laugh)
You.
(laughs)
(quietly): Her husband fell down a spiral staircase.
- What?
- He kept falling, falling, continually falling.
It was awful.
He didn't die.
But when he found out that he had become a viral sensation - he k*lled himself.
- Ugh.
I know how he feels.
Jess, are you still upset about Nick?
You got to, you got to move past that.
It's hard.
You don't know what it's like to be alone.
I do know what it's like.
- Ashley and I broke up.
- What?!
- Yeah.
- When?
Yeah, about six months ago.
Uh, but I-I didn't want to worry you.
Dad.
It's my job to worry.
Was it the 40-year age difference?
Were you tired of waiters just asking again and again if it was a daddy-daughter dinner?
Sorry, no, that's not REAGAN: You said that the pill sold itself, so let me ask you, is the pill a cure for a kick in the b*lls?
Because you're gonna need it.
- Oh, no.
- Hey, Nicky, what's up?
Uh, I can wait.
No, it's okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.
I want to tell you (mouths)
- What?
- I said what I needed to say.
Nothing came out of your mouth.
I feel like we're on a train.
Where are we going?
We're going to San Diego.
- What?
- I panicked and it just came out.
Let me tell you something, sister, your plan didn't work.
This wasn't my plan.
Well, you brought up trains, didn't you?
And you got in my head.
San Diego part?
Well, that's on me.
I'm not engaging with you over this.
- So, what do we do now?
- I don't know, Nick.
I've never experienced a person trying to break up with someone, and instead inviting them on a beach vacation.
I didn't do this on purpose.
I feel like you led me here.
- This is not on me.
- So what do you want me to do?
You want me to go break up with her down in San Diego?
I don't, I don't care at this point.
- Why?
Because it's private?
- Live your life, man.
Because the weather is really nice?
And what happens if it doesn't work out?
I'm just gonna go move down to Mexico and start a new life?
No one's suggesting any of this.
You're a genius.
(laughs)
Thank you, Aly.
I knew I came to the right person.
I'll do it.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I feel like I should call San Diego to warn them about you.
But you seem convinced, so if it gets you out of here faster, God bless.
- Do you believe in God, Aly?
- I believe in hell and I'm in it.
- Oh, this is hell?
- Yes!
Then why don't you stay out of my business?!
That's all I'm trying to do, but you keep bringing me your business!
Ah, to hell with you!
We're going to San Diego!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Go!
- I'm going!
Don't say anything.
I should have known right from the start.
On our honeymoon, we're in the ocean, a-a-and Ashley sees a shark coming towards us.
You know what she does?
She pushes me in front of it and says, "Eat him! Eat him!"
- What?
- That-that was a clue.
- That was a clue.
- I just hate thinking of you all alone in that house.
I'm fine.
I got my cans.
Gets me out of bed in the morning.
- What if you met someone new?
- Oh, no.
- JESS: Really.
- BOB: Aw, no.
Dad, what about
- what about Priscilla?
- What?
- What?
Come on.
- No.
No.
I'm an old man.
She doesn't want an old man.
Look.
I've got a Band-Aid on my hand.
Not on the finger, the hand.
That is an old-man thing.
Okay.
Hey, Priscilla.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hi.
I was wondering if you would like to get a decaf coffee and talk about local news with my dad.
Really, Bob?
You want to take me out?
- Ha, ha, ha, you - (laughs)
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Yeah, I have a new jean jacket I've been wanting to break out.
It's stone-washed.
BOB: Okay.
Okay.
Well, that was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Even though this morning I thought you were married.
What about you?
I'm supposed to be cheering you up.
You did cheer me up.
You got me off of the couch.
It's good to be out of the house.
You kids have fun.
Okay, thanks.
So this is a surprise.
Where do you think we should go?
Where do you think we should go?
Look, Schmidt, we both know there's only room for one Winston.
And we found that out the hard way, didn't we?
Homecoming weekend, 2002.
- I'm Winston!
I'm Winston!
- I'm Winston!
I'm Winston!
We can't live like this!
- Only one Winston.
- Body slam!
Get off!
Get off!
You'll k*ll him!
We have tried every single variation.
Fat Winston, Thin Winston.
Too derogatory.
Black Winston, Jew Winston.
Obviously problematic.
Hot Winston, Ugly Winston.
Now that nearly tore us apart.
Which is why we came up with the one-Winston rule.
Yeah, but those were angry times.
Let's make it double W's.
(exhales)
Welcome back, Winston.
It's good to be back, Winston.
- REAGAN: San Diego.
- The wonderful San Diego.
- Where are we staying?
- Not sure.
Maybe we're gonna get the nicest hotel in the city, huh?
Maybe you're gonna stay there, and maybe I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles today.
I'm gonna stay in San Diego, and you're gonna go back?
Who knows what's gonna happen down there?
That's the fun of a trip like this.
Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna m*rder me, right?
No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.
What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?
- Yeah.
The guy taking you to San Diego the Paris of Southern California?
- Okay.
- You're losing it.
I'm acting totally normal.
You need a drink just to chill out.
- What is wrong with you?
- Getting those drinks.
MAN (over P. A. ): This stop, Anaheim.
(mouths)
(train horn bl*ws)
(mouthing)
You should have seen him.
The only time my dad gets that nervous is when he doesn't know where to print out his boarding pass.
It's so weird to think of him dating again.
- BOB (moaning): Oh!
Oh - Wait.
What is that?
It sounds like someone's moving a washing machine.
Oh, my God, my dad's boning!
- My dad's boning!
My dad's boning!
- Oh, my God, listen to me.
Get out of the house.
Get out of the house!
(cans clattering loudly)
- BOB: Jess?
Is that you?
- No.
Yes.
I mean, no, it's the cans.
I just, um Finish what you're doing.
No, don't finish.
I mean, everyone deserves to finish oh, God!
- (cans clattering)
- Oh, cans!
- Can we talk about this?
- Yeah, just one sec.
I'm just replacing the sound of your skin slapping against someone else's with the sound of crushing metal.
I didn't know you were gonna be home.
I thought you were gonna be out having a day.
And you were supposed to be having coffee.
You just put out on the first date?
We had a connection.
I-I think I'm in love with her.
Oh, my God, I need more cans.
I got to have more cans.
Hey, you know, I'm a passionate guy.
- All right.
- What are you doing, Dad?
Well, I mean, you were nice enough to help me to move on.
Now I'm gonna see if I can find somebody for you.
Got it.
My best friend Ray.
His son John.
Well, he's a little heavyset, but, you know, he makes a good living.
Dad, put the Rolodex down.
Look, we're not in the same boat, okay?
I can't move on.
I love him.
Nick?
What do you see in him?
I mean, he looks like the only white waiter at a Chinese restaurant.
There isn't a logical explanation, but it is what it is.
I love him.
I wish I didn't, but I do.
- Come here.
- Dad, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the recycling plant.
It closes in an hour.
From now on, I will be Winston Schmidt, and he will be Winston Bishop.
We are both Winstons.
Wait, your first name is Winston?
- Did I know that?
- No.
I have not slept in 36 hours.
Well, you should get some sleep.
- Isn't that right, Winston?
- Oh, absolutely, Winston.
Sleep is very important.
It is the most important, Winston.
Okay, this is already too much.
In my head it wasn't this annoying.
Winston, why don't you just go by "The Bish"?
- I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
- You know I'm talking to you.
I knew she was talking to you.
- You knew the whole time?
- Yeah.
Ooh, I couldn't tell.
Wait a minute, why does Winston - Yes?
- Oh, my God.
Why does my Winston have to change his name?
- Schmidt, don't you have a middle name?
- I do have a middle name.
- It's Saint-Marie.
- Hmm.
- And obviously I can't go by that.
- That's hilarious.
Oh, hello, hello!
Wait, what are you doing here?
Oh, well, I couldn't break up with Reagan, - so I jumped off the train.
- Hmm?
- Problem, problem solved.
- What's up with you guys?
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I don't know, Schmidt, 'cause you weren't around, I guess.
Well, actually, I'm Winston now.
I'm using my first name again.
Uh actually there can't be two Winstons.
It nearly destroyed us.
Nick, hold up, can we go back to that moment where you jumped off a train?
Sure.
You find that part interesting?
Okay, I don't care about the answer, but I feel like I got to ask, as someone who works in law enforcement where is Reagan?
Well, she's probably getting off at the next stop, and then she'll be on her way here for some sort of a reckoning, I would imagine.
"Problem solved" was probably a bit of a, an overstatement.
The good news is that I don't have to break up with her 'cause now she's gonna break up with me.
- Oh, Nick.
- What is wrong with you?
It's gonna be okay, Nick.
Give Winston a hug.
- Come on.
Here we go.
- Here you go, Winston.
I meant "me Winston.
" - I'm "me Winston," too!
- Hey, guys!
Reagan's on her way.
I've got too much to deal with to deal with this two Winstons thing.
What, I can't have a first name because you left some woman on a train?
Don't put that on me, man!
I'm not calling you Winston, Schmidt.
'Cause if I do, then what am I gonna call the real Winston?
Call him I don't care!
I don't care!
- Hey, Winston, you want to get a drink?
- Sure.
- I'm down.
- I was talking to that Winston.
- Oh.
- After the drink, you want to get some dinner, Winston?
- Ooh, you know your boy hungry.
- Yes.
That time I was talking to this Winston.
- So, I can come if you want.
- I'm down to go.
No, I'm trying to figure it out, okay?
Wait, time out.
Are we eating, or are we not eating?
They're both real Winstons, but the old Winston is now The Bish.
I'm not calling my fiancÃ© "The" anything.
Nah, man, this is taking me to a bad place.
- I'm having I'm having cold feet.
- What?
Yeah, the two Winstons thing is not gonna work Nick is right.
You've had Winston for 15 years.
It's my turn.
I'm Winston.
You will never be Winston.
- Oh, you want to dance?
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?
Okay.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay, what is happening?
- WINSTON: Come on.
- SCHMIDT: Come on.
- I used to live by myself.
- Come on.
- Come on.
I had covered parking, I was happy.
- I'm Winston.
- Guys, no.
It's not about you, man.
I am Winston.
Shut up!
I'll k*ll you!
I'll m*rder you!
NICK: I can't do this right now.
I got too much on my plate.
- I'm Winston.
- I'm Winston.
- Nah, I'm Winston.
- Ah, I'm Winston.
Yet, somehow, all the Michaels in the world manage to deal with this every day.
Mm-hmm.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- Mr.
Day.
It's Nick Miller.
- Is Jess there?
- She's out.
Can I take what I assume will be an idiotic message?
Ah, it's actually, it's kind of private.
Okay, fine.
Talk to you later.
Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
I'm breaking up with Reagan and it didn't quite go as planned.
I'm, I'm in a really bad situation and Jess always says the right thing and I, I really need her.
Let me, let me ask you a question.
You're in the ocean with Jess, and a shark starts coming towards you.
- What do you do?
- Which ocean?
I-I don't know, Pacific.
- What type of shark?
- What the hell difference does it make?
Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.
Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing if not, it definitely should be.
It's just a regular shark.
You know what?
Good-bye.
Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me, I'm sure I'm sure we'd be okay.
She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and she's just the greatest person I have ever met.
Bob?
Does that answer your question or what?
It does.
Weirdly enough, it does.
But I also don't accept your weird-ass premise, man, 'cause it's absolutely preposterous - REAGAN: Nick.
- NICK: Oh, my God.
She's here.
Nick.
Nicholas, I can see you.
Hey.
How was San Diego?
Hey, so Reagan's in your room, packing up her stuff.
What'd you say to her?
Nothing.
I-I didn't say anything.
I just, uh, crawled out from under the bed where I was hiding.
She said, "It's over," which makes sense, and then I came in here, and this is now my fifth beer in as many minutes.
- I'm impressed.
- No, you shouldn't be.
I once drank nine beers in five minutes.
I hear that cry for help, but I meant the breakup.
You ended a relationship without any confrontation.
You got what you wanted.
Then why do I feel so terrible?
Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.
Right.
I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.
But I'm also glad you were here 'cause I feel like we bonded.
It was one of the most frustrating days of my entire life.
I'm exhausted.
I feel like a single mom in a mop commercial.
Welcome to the loft.
Hey.
Taking a little trip?
I hear San Diego's lovely.
I regret that.
I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.
You deserve better than that.
The truth is, is I wanted to break up with you, and I didn't know how to.
Okay.
I mean, I'm not mad anymore, more just scared of what it must be like to have to live inside of your head.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I've been thinking about breaking up with you for a while.
So, we just wanted really different things.
I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.
I'm not good at good-byes either.
I think I'm gonna go stand in the closet for a little bit.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye, Nick.
Yeah, bye, Reagan.
What do you want?
To be your friend.
If you need the name Winston to get you to where you're going, then I'm not gonna stand in your way.
You're a good friend.
Uh, uh, what will I call you?
Well, I was gonna give Saint-Marie a whirl, but then I was like, nah, that's a girl's name.
And I thought about Two-Shoes.
- Two-Shoes.
- Two-Shoes, yeah.
But then, in certain shoes that I have, I have three of them, so so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.
Come here.
Thank you, The Bish.
Thanks, Winston.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you come on inside Very weird.
Strange man.
I love Wednesday nights.
And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.
I love you, Cece.
I love you so much, Winston.
Oh, God.
I don't like it!
I don't like it!
I don't like it!
- Damn it!
- Ugh Take your name back.
SCHMIDT: I don't want it.
- What's wrong with the name Winston?
- It's horrible, just take it back.
Worst name in the entire history of names.
What'd you say about my name?
Stop.
N You know what, I don't care.
Come on.
(shouts)
Cha-ching.
Hey, hey, Jess!
Jess!
I've been trying to call you.
I-I talked to Nick.
- What?
- He called looking for you, and you know, oddly, I-I see what you see in him.
It doesn't matter.
He has a girlfriend.
He and Reagan broke up.
And you know something?
I don't even think he realizes it, but he's still in love with you.
(grunting, shouting)
I got you, I got you!
I got you!
Got your arm!
I'm gonna break it.
WINSTON: Aah, that's my arm!
I need it, I need it!
It's only a matter of time before life begins You talk to a stranger and suddenly you're friends There she goes.
Off to college.
Circle of life.
Okay.
Before you even learn to break or bend (sighs)
This is right.
I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna profess my love to Nick.
- I'm very proud of you, sweetie.
- Thanks, Dad.
I'm proud of you, too.
You really just humped your way right into things, didn't you, Priscilla?
- I kinda wanted the front seat.
- I called it.
Jess, are you okay?
Honey, you just fled to your dad's house in Portland.
What I did was a very tasteful, very understated skedaddle so I could get some much needed space from Nick, and it worked.
I'm fine.
- So, you're coming back?
- I would, but Ashley's out of town, and the man doesn't do well without his wife.
I can't in good conscience leave my elderly father here without someone to help him steam-clean his bowling trophies.
Hey, Jess.
I think you should go home.
Shut up, TV!
That was the TV.
- Hello?
- Go home?
I just got here.
And I-I love that.
I love a surprise visit for no reason at all.
We had fun, but don't you think it's now, it's time for you to, you know, get back to your life.
Dad, you still need me.
I mean we really half-assed those trophies!
What?
Th-they look great.
Look.
Oh, this one.
This one is fantastic.
See this one?
This is the ball that I won that trophy with.
This ball right here.
Helen, I call - Oh!
Dad!
- (screaming)
I-I waxed the holes.
You waxed the holes?!
Was I-I not supposed to?
Not wise!
Not wise!
- It's okay.
- (whimpering)
I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
(grunts)
Oh, I'm so nervous to meet your mom.
I'm bad with women and family.
I wish she was a male stranger.
NICK: You guys talking about Charmaine?
- Yeah, my mom.
- Charmaine is a tough lady.
My mom is just protective, okay?
My dad walked out on us when I was a baby.
- I am her only son.
- Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
- Rude.
- What are we doing here?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Why are you here?
- What, just because we moved, we have to justify our presence here?
Well, you don't live here, so We're allowed to be here for no reason at all.
Oh, I get it.
You're sad and lonely in your new house and you miss us.
We do not need this.
If anything, you-you people need us.
We are married homeowners.
Benefit from our wisdom.
Okay!
I got to go.
Aly and I have an invited guest to plan for.
- Oh.
- NICK: Good burn, Winston.
- You're getting better at those.
- Thanks, man!
Okay, I am off to my drug party.
Reagan's, uh, pharm rep crew is in town for a convention.
Have fun.
If you get too drunk to drive, call me, 'cause I will be, too, and we can be twins.
Wait, you're not going?
Don't you want to meet Reagan's friends?
Mm, we never really talked about it.
Seems like something that a married homeowner should weigh in on.
How could you not talk about such a major relationship step?
Ugh, because we're not all couple-y like you guys are.
We don't talk about every little tiny We don't gab all day like a couple of Italian grandmas hanging their laundry.
SCHMIDT: Talking is the lifeblood of a relationship.
- Truth.
- The problem is, is neither one of you wants to take the initiative.
You're both communication bottoms.
One of you needs to be the top.
What does this have anything to do with hamburger buns?
Look, we do things in our own way, right?
It's not like I don't want Nick to come with me.
And for the record, I would love to meet your friends.
- That would be great.
- So All right, I'm going!
Get off my back!
So what are you guys doing here?
- Never.
Never in my entire life.
- Okay.
- Never.
Never.
- My blood built this loft.
Maybe as an icebreaker we tell your mom about the time we actually arrested Jay Leno for jaywalking.
One small thing it's a footnote, really my mom don't know I'm a cop.
What?
- Winston, why?
- She's a-a protective single mom.
She's always freaked out at the tiniest thing.
My baby!
I turn my head for one second.
Lord, where is my baby?!
- Wh
- I went to look at bikes.
Oh!
She still thinks I'm in sports radio.
I still record shows for her.
You got to promise not to blow my cover.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I have so much police stuff.
Now, I realize you're getting caught up in a lie against your will, but my mom is coming to see you.
Okay?
It won't even come up.
But if it does, you're my producer.
- Bishop!
- I'm-a hide that.
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him Pretty slim pickings at the drugstore.
All I got was, uh, Freckle Me Once: The Unauthorized Lindsay Lohan Story.
Anyway, I got all your stuff your bandages, your hydrogen peroxide, your gummy peaches You're making too big a fuss out of this.
I mean, I've had so much worse.
This is just a bruised toe.
It's your index toe.
Very serious.
That's the toe you point with.
You've been great to me.
You've taken care of me.
Now I'm gonna do something for you.
I'm gonna get you a ticket.
Oh, here it is.
Portland to L. A.
Dad, I am not leaving you like this.
Recovery is the most vulnerable part of the process, and this house is full of stairs and sharp corners.
And you know how slippery your bathtub is.
I won't stand up!
I'll just roll out!
Dad, I'm sorry, but I need to show you a little tough love.
Get in bed.
Do it.
"She was born on the freakiest of Fridays" Okay, we're in 42 markets, big show coming up - with Stephen A's brother Stephen B.
- B.
our lead-in is a cooking show - called The Ugly Dumpling - So funny.
Hey, is all of this necessary?
That's just in case it comes up.
Which, like I said (chuckles)
it won't.
Mm I feel like it might.
- Mother-in-law troubles, huh?
- What?
- Second mom drahm?
- Hey, seriously why are you still here?
That's your most pressing question right now?
Not why did I sign up for this ill-advised talk radio alternative reality?
Guys, we're trying to prep, okay?
So if you're gonna be in our home, please, step back from the mic.
That's radio lingo for when someone's on the microphone and you don't want them to be; - you say, "Step away from" - I got it.
CHARMAINE: Baby!
You are a radio personality!
You just can't leave your front door open for any ol' Menendez brothers to walk into.
- Ooh!
- (chuckling)
(grunts, chuckles)
- This is Aly.
- Hey!
Long time listener, first time visitor.
- Oh.
(chuckles)
- (chuckles)
Radio.
She referenced radio.
Uh, yeah, Mom, you know, we talk about work all day long, so Well, it's not work when it's with your girl.
Now, Aly, tell me, do you two ever sing the call letters to each other to fall asleep?
Mm, mm-hmm.
Yep.
KQWP Oh, I thought you two moved.
(whistles)
Whoa, drug companies have a lot of money.
Well, this is great.
I feel like you finally brought me to your home planet.
Yeah.
I'm really glad you came.
All right.
So tell me about these pharm reps I'm about to meet.
I mean, I don't know what I can really tell you about them.
We sort of became friends at these conventions, and we go from city to city with each other.
It's kind of like camp friends?
Except everybody's, uh, slept together a whole lot.
It's exactly like camp friends, I guess.
All these people have had sex with each other?
- Mostly, yeah.
- Mostly.
And with you?
You had sex with the yeah?
- Why wouldn't you?
- Yeah.
Oh, you guys are like groupies, but for yourself.
I dig it.
Are we gonna have to, like, talk this out right now?
Or - I'm good.
Are you good?
- Yeah.
- I'm cool.
- Okay.
Ah, I'm not a talker.
Talking's not my thing.
Great.
This is why we work.
'Cause we're not like Schmidt and Cece.
We don't have to write each other a love poem every time I go into the other room.
- Oh, pass.
- JACK: Reags.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Oh.
- Oh.
- (laughs)
Off the ground.
- Jack.
- I'm Nick, and I-I might win a raffle tonight.
(laughing)
So, Reagan, you gonna save me a pas de deux tonight?
Okay.
(laughter)
What's going on?
What are you guys laughing at?
I don't get the joke.
Well, you do know that she was a professionally trained ballet dancer?
You never told me you were a ballerina.
I sort of shattered both of my ankles in this thing I refer to as "The Crackening.
" Your ankles?
Like, both your ankles?
And both of my knees and a little bit of my pelvis.
What?
I could be the Queen of Egypt and your mom wouldn't know, because all she wants to do is talk about the radio show that doesn't exist.
That's on me.
Maybe I should have made my fake radio show less intriguing.
It's 7:12 and you know what that means.
Traffic on the 12 with Linda.
(clears throat)
(higher voice): It's just way too much damn traffic out here.
I can't get to work.
(laughs)
Linda.
Your big ass on the bus, stop playing.
Babe, how will I ever break through to your mom if I keep lying to her?
This is crazy.
- That's on me, too.
- I know it's on you.
You're the only person it could be on.
- And that is my bad.
- I know it's your bad.
Aly.
You have seven identical stripe long sleeve shirts?
Yeah.
I-I know it's strange.
Um, it-it was a deal.
- Buy five, get two free.
- Oh.
- You still got the receipt?
- Of course I do.
BB Taxx has the same items, four for $20.
Wait.
Are you a DDS?
DDS since '73.
What?
Are you both secret dentists?
CHARMAINE AND ALY: Deep discount shoppers.
- OG price, $350.
98.
- Ooh.
- BB Taxx price, - Uh-huh.
- $72.
99 - CHARMAINE: Ooh.
- $72.
99!
- Ooh.
And someone didn't limit their price match to California.
Arkansas prices, y'all.
What do you say we get back in our cubbies - and keep this fashion show going.
- Okay.
I don't know why I'm just putting this together, but you two are very cheap.
- You're about to feel - You dunno what you're talking about.
- my cheap purse on your temple.
- You do not know.
Easy now.
What do you think, Nick?
Should she take it?
Take what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Reagan's big promotion.
Her promotion?
- Should she take it?
- I never I didn't hear about it until right now.
It's just VP of North American sales.
- VP?
- It's not a big deal.
It's just like a heartbeat away from president of North American sales, so - Seems like a pretty big deal.
- Reagan, it's huge.
You get to travel all the time.
So many hotel points.
Mo' points, mo' problems, that's what I always say.
It's exciting finding out this way.
Most people would probably tell their boyfriend when they first found out about it, but that's cool.
We don't talk, that's why we work, and that's cool and, uh, I'm really bothered by this.
- Nick.
- (gasps)
(ringtone plays)
Hey, Jess, it's me again.
Sorry to call you again.
I just I just really wish you would call me back.
I'm having a problem, and I feel like you really like when I'm, you know, I'm having a problem.
Not that you, not that you like it, but, but that-that you like, you like talking about it.
Anyway, I'm just coming apart here.
I'm-I'm really a hundred percent falling apart, and I really wish you would call me back.
- (phone beeps)
- All right.
Hey, Schmidty, what's up?
Just checking in.
- Okay.
- (phone beeps)
Oh, hold on, I got another call.
All of a sudden my phone's bl*wing up.
Hi.
This is Nick Miller.
Who am I speaking to and why are you calling?
- Do you not have my number saved?
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
- Who am I speaking to?
It's it's Cece.
Cece, why are you both calling me?
How do you not have my number saved?
I work for you.
Cece, I already got Nick.
Let me patch you in.
How am I supposed to learn to do a patch if you never let me try?
Nick, as the only person who takes our advice, - how you doing?
- Well, you were right.
Reagan and I never talk.
We helped you.
Cece, we helped him.
- I know, I heard.
- No.
You messed everything up.
You stupid idiots made me realize that I need more than that.
Now I got to go back to this party with her friends and pretend like it doesn't bother me.
- Those look fantastic.
- CECE: Oh, honey, that sounds so rough.
I said ho one second, my man.
In the middle of a conversation.
(Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" plays)
Dad, I know you got out of bed.
No, I-I didn't, I didn't.
I-I-I've been, I've been sleeping.
I found these little crummies in the kitchen.
You only gave me a salad and tea.
I-I-I-I wanted some fish sticks.
Fish sticks are mostly pork and you know it.
Now, I'm gonna trim your nails.
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, uh, uh, - it's-it's a little too short.
- (clippers snap)
It's too ow, ow!
(screaming)
I have a good thing going with your mom right now, and I don't want to ruin that.
- We should just tell her the truth.
- CECE: Hey-o!
Problem alert.
Well, if you need help, you've come to the right place.
Share, share.
Please.
Tell us what seems to be the problem.
Here's what you're doing, and it's not okay.
You're inserting yourself into a family matter.
We can handle this on our own.
- We're here if you need us.
- Yeah, watch your front, - 'cause we've got your back.
- We got your back.
I just want you to know that I respect that.
I'm perceiving that.
Um I'm digesting that.
It's in the machine.
It's working its way down.
And okay.
I think you're right.
I think it'll be really good for you to be honest with your mom.
No.
See, um, you're gonna come clean.
I'm gonna stay dirty.
- Why?
- CHARMAINE: Aly, I found a roly-poly in these pants, they gave me 89% off.
- Oh.
- (laughs)
That's sweet.
Um Charmaine, I have to tell you something.
I don't work in radio.
I don't.
I'm actually a cop.
What?
Man, you wearing a wire?
Okay.
(whispering): Sorry.
Well, I appreciate you telling me the truth.
The job is dangerous.
But I do salute your courage.
(exhales)
Okay.
Um you can salute me, too.
'Cause, uh, - I'm also a cop.
- What?!
Uh, uh, uh, I'm-I'm not a super successful morning radio shock jock.
- There's no radio show?
- No.
I'm a - I'm an officer of the law.
- What?!
That's not how you reacted when Aly said she was a cop.
Being a parent is like wearing your heart outside your body, and now you're telling me that my heart is on these streets by himself?
Sampling drugs with a Kn*fe to see if it's really cocaine?
My heart knows what cocaine tastes like?
- Oh, man.
- (door slams)
- That's on you, man.
- Please shut up.
REAGAN: It isn't a dream job.
Sure, it comes with a great salary and a vaccination for the coming elk flu, the flu that you're gonna be hearing about for the next decade.
But it also requires too much travel, and I'm gonna turn it down.
- Are you happy now?
- No.
I'm not happy.
'Cause this is the kind of talk I wish we had before.
These are the important talks.
This is so unlike you.
Why are you being the girl in this argument?
I don't know, Reagan.
I don't know.
But I do know you're being heteronormative.
Okay?
I know that word it's in the Zeitgeist, and I know that word, too.
I don't know why I'm acting this way.
ANNOUNCER: If you're out there, Nick Miller, you're our raffle winner!
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
I did spend $190 on tickets.
$200.
I spent $250 on tickets.
That's it.
I spent over $300 on tickets.
"Deciding which house to go to for Thanksgiving, "she was stuck in a real parent trap.
" - Enough.
Enough.
Enough.
- Oh, you're right.
- This chapter's dragging.
- Jess, please.
- Let me move on.
- I-I need my freedom.
I need my judge shows, my fish sticks.
My-my naked time.
- Oh, please don't expand on that.
- No, it's a good thing.
Ashley showed me how to embrace my body.
And I every day, for about a half an hour, I walk around here naked.
- Fabulous.
- Did you sit on this chair?
Jess now I'm gonna show you some tough love.
I want you to go back to California.
(sighs)
Wh-what's going on?
It's Nick.
I - What?
- I'm-I'm in love with him, and I can't I can't do anything about it.
I'm sorry.
He's really happy with someone else.
- I couldn't go back there.
- Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
You can stay here as long as you want.
You've been taking care of me, now I'm gonna take care of you.
You know what, I'm gonna read you one of my favorite books.
See?
- Oh - Before the Web: The Story of Telephone Operators.
"She sat by the switchboard, "anxiously awaiting "the phone call.
"Ring.
Ring.
"Ring.
" I don't even understand what we're arguing about.
I'm mad about the promotion.
And that you have been sitting on it for a month and not telling me.
I thought that you liked that we have our own thing.
- I don't know, maybe I - That we were two independent, different people and we live our lives and then we come together and we hang out.
I just want more, I guess.
I want to talk about stuff, and I know while I'm saying this I hate that I'm saying it, but I feel it.
Nick, we're talking about stuff right now.
No, we're not talking about all the stuff.
- We're talking about some of the stuff.
- How much stuff is there?
There's piles of stuff.
There's piles upon piles of stuff.
Like, I want to talk about I want to talk about why we don't have nicknames for each other?
I mean, why don't we call each other Mr.
Cub and Sparky?
Who's Mr.
Cub?
You're Mr. Cub?
You think I would be Sparky?
If we had nicknames it would not be those.
You just call me Nick, is my point.
- That's your name.
- I know, but I would like to talk about nicknames.
It doesn't matter.
All this matters.
This is the stuff.
I want to talk about why you have a second apartment.
- We talked about that.
- And it was weird then.
We barely talked about it.
I also want to talk about the fact I've never been at my best sexually with you.
I've been, like, a seven, but, at other times in my life, I've been an eight-and-a-half.
- Okay.
- But you've only seen a seven.
So you think of me as a seven in bed.
- But I'm an eight-and-a-half.
- I'm really tired.
Can you just write it all down and I'll fill it out and I'll get it back to you.
All right, then just answer me this, and then we'll be done.
'Cause this is important.
If we weren't together and you were offered this same promotion, would you take it?
Yes, I would take it.
Then you should take the job, Reagan.
Okay, I'll take it.
Are we cool?
Yeah.
Dream job.
Good, I'm so happy for you.
This is awesome.
Uh, okay.
(clears throat)
But before we go to bed tonight, can you please just do something about your raffle prize?
- His name's Stewart.
- Why did you bring it home?
I don't know, I won.
(grunts)
Hey, thought I might find you here.
Oh.
- Hiding your maybes?
- (chuckles)
Sometimes I hide mine in a garbage can.
A new one.
Don't try to talk me out of worrying about my son.
I won't.
I just want you to know you're not alone.
I'm out there worrying about him, too, but we have got each other's backs.
How's that dress gonna fit you when you ain't got no legs?
Oh.
I need to tell you something.
No, no, just let me go first.
This job has given me so much.
Purpose, pride, my future wife, CPR certification against my will, I might add, because I truly believe that it is witchcraft, but that's not the point.
I have tried so many things.
But being a cop is the first time I've ever felt a calling.
I'm proud of you.
Yeah.
I-I will deal with my fears.
Um but there's one more thing.
Oh, my God.
Mom, you've been a cop this whole time?
No.
- You're not a cop.
- It was your dad's.
He's a cop.
Wherever the hell he is.
Wow.
Um You know, that's the first thing you ever told me about him.
So you know I got a lot of practice worrying about someone coming home.
Maybe that's the reason I'm so overprotective with you.
He left this behind, among other things.
I just use it to get out of tickets.
And one time I did use it for a discount on a - a rental car.
- Oh.
- Take it.
- No, I don't want it.
You're my dad.
You're my mom and my dad.
I know that.
And I'm not saying he's not a piece of crap, either.
But you should have this.
We can talk about this later, but what was the rental car company you used?
(sighs)
Well, I don't think me and Reagan are working out.
Really?
Oh, bub, I'm so sorry.
Come lay your head on my bosom.
Come here.
No, I'll do hers if I was gonna do either, but well, I'm really glad you guys are here.
Tell us everything.
- But first, say that one more time.
- Oh, you really want me to?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Uh, I'm really glad you're here.
We're really glad that we're here, too.
Very happy about it.
- All right.
- One more time.
The part about you being glad that we're here.
- Making me regret it.
- One more time.
I feel like we talked about everything.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
(Australian accent): I like American football a lot.
And you know who I like, I like that Tom Brady.
Uh, I like the way he looks, I like the way he smells.
Nick, shut up, man!
I'm at I'm at work.
Mi-mi-mi, mi-mi-mi.
Chacho.
(deep voice): Chacho.
This is traffic on the 12.
Linda?
Move!
Get your ass out the way!
I'm trying to get to work on time.
Linda, you okay?
I'm fine.
It's the reason why I'm late.
I'm in traffic behind a damn Camry.
If he don't move his ass out the way Linda, all right, that's enough of you.
(laughs)
PG-13.
So I really want to ask what's in the box, but, uh, it'll ignite a whole Seven thing.
"What's in the box?
What's in the box?"
"Repeat, John Doe has the upper hand.
" I have got to see this movie.
You guys make it sound so hilarious.
Anyway, my former boss, Principal Foster, survived a real dicey safari in Africa.
His takeaway was that material possessions mean nothing.
Including his collection of super fancy, old-ass wine.
The lions came at night.
That put everything in perspective.
Everything, dawg.
Ooh.
Jess, thank you.
This is perfect.
Cece and I are completely moved into Jaipur Aviv.
So tonight, we'll be doing it for the first time on our first night in our first house.
And I'm going to Aly's tonight.
Yeah.
Gonna be doing it for the 10,000th time on our 1,000th night in her 100th apartment?
You think Aly's lived in 100 apartments?
I hadn't, I hadn't crunched the numbers on it.
So, Reagan's out of town till tomorrow.
What are you and Nick gonna do tonight?
What makes you assume I'm hanging out with Nick?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing tonight?
(mumbles): Picking out clothes for Nick.
What?
I can't hear you.
I'm helping Nick pick out an outfit.
I we have to nail down his look for SOCALYALCON 6.
Wow, SOCALYALCON 6.
Wow.
I can't believe it's been a whole year since the last Southern California Young Adult Literature Conference.
NICK: You're a 12-year-old girl.
You spent $35 to meet me.
Is this what you want me to look like?
I got two questions: uh, where'd I get $35 from, and also, can my name be Daphne?
And I read that authors should all have a strong look, so I found four authors with strong looks, and I combined them.
Tom Wolfe: white suit.
Hunter S.
Thompson: yellow sunglasses.
David Foster Wallace: bandana.
Toni Morrison: The Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Here you go.
Well, that's perfect, Jess.
Well, it was easy.
You have very few clothing items in your closet.
Also, are those your tax returns?
And why are you drying beef?
Because I don't have a file cabinet, and because I couldn't eat all the meat in one night.
- Now - That's gross.
- how do I look?
- What you need is a navy blazer.
Do you have a navy blazer or just the pit boss special?
What kind of a man owns multiple blazers?
(snickering)
SCHMIDT: Ha!
There's so many places for sex!
(moans)
(panting): All right.
That makes it official.
Houses are way better than apartments.
Now that we're out of closets, watch out laundry room.
- (chuckles)
- (exhales)
- Know what that sound is?
- Hmm?
That is the absence of Nick.
The lack of Winston.
(knocking on door)
- What was that?
- Someone's hitting our house.
It sounded like, like, a, like, knocking.
Yeah, but the-the door is that way.
Oh, my God, I totally forgot.
We have a back door.
BOTH: Houses have a back door.
(laughs)
What kind of person comes to a back door?
- Jeremy.
- On behalf of the neighborhood, may I be the first to say, welcome, sir.
"A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy.
" - I didn't know you lived nearby.
- I don't.
But I will someday.
Just as I will do everything that you have done.
(grunts)
That's the tone that we talked about, Jeremy.
No, thank you.
I can't wait to have a servants' entrance.
- Let's not call it that.
- Two points of entry.
Very well done, sir.
Cece, I just thought of another reason why houses are better than apartments.
- Now we can enjoy two points of entry!
- CECE: No, thanks!
I'm talking about the doors.
I-I didn't mean ALY: So a lion scares Jess's old boss in Nigeria, and we get so drunk we have sex on a dresser in America.
What a world.
- It's all connected, baby.
- (chuckles)
And the broken dresser, that's my fault.
I'm all haunch.
- I'll buy you a new one.
- You don't have to.
Because guess who has two dressers.
- Rip Torn.
- No.
Me.
I mean, you and Rip Torn.
Stop talking about Rip Torn.
- You have a backup dresser?
- Yeah.
Just when I thought you couldn't get any more perfect.
It's in my ugh, my storage unit.
I-I'll get it tomorrow.
A dresser's pretty big; I could help you.
That's okay.
I'll just get it tomorrow.
- I mean, my day is wide open
- I said no!
(quietly): Okay.
"A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy" is very comprehensive.
Yes, the fact that we're in between a raisin house and a toothbrush house, makes me feel very confident about Halloween.
Crime statistics?
We have crime?
Crime that warrants statistics?
Oh, my God.
It says there were 14 home invasions last year.
Up six percent from 2015?
Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-we're just gonna get worked up about nothing.
Right?
There are only two ways into this place, the front door and the back door and we've locked them both.
- We're good, we're good.
- We're good.
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah, no.
It's fine.
- Yeah.
We're fine.
- I just - Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
At the risk of sounding clichÃ©, should we have sex in the bedroom?
I think that's a great idea.
- (chuckles)
- (clattering)
- (gasps, shrieks)
- The hell was that?!
Are you the criminals?!
From the statistics?!
(Nick groaning)
- (shouts)
- Oh, what are you doing?
I almost h*t you with this brushed steel modern lamp.
- Really?
- I am sorry we broke in, but I'm also pretty impressed with us.
What kind of taco meat you bitches have?
(Nick and Jess laugh)
SCHMIDT: I told you, if we locked both the doors, our guests would know to come in through the windows.
Our ground floor windows.
You see?
What started out as snark has become a real eye-opener.
What did you want us to do?
Ring the bell and wake you guys up?
Oh, no.
Thank God you didn't wake us up.
See?
I told you they'd be cool.
Ask him.
You were right.
Schmidt, here's my question.
Apologies.
My author look is missing one thing Navy blue, medium weight, two button.
I know the blazer.
Nick, listen to me.
If you ever, ever need a blazer, I don't care how late it is, till the day I die, you wake me up.
Thanks.
Okay.
We're gonna have a conversation.
- I am a little concerned.
- I know.
What if the blazer doesn't fit?
No.
About you and Nick.
And about how you're being his girlfriend.
- You mean being his good friend.
- I mean being his girlfriend.
A good friend will maybe drive someone to the mall in the daytime so that they can buy a blazer.
They don't go on a giggly late night crime date so that they can steal one.
That's girlfriend stuff.
You've been doing a lot of girlfriend stuff lately.
"Godfather of Soul, blank Brown. " Five letters.
- Bubba.
- Okay.
Wait, you want to know who wins in a fight between Winston Bishop and Winston Churchill?
Hey, do you know what this book's about?
Bayou n-noir.
Uh, Pepperwood, he's a private investigator It's about a man who has nothing, who risks everything, to feel something.
Thank you.
None of that's girlfriend stuff.
That's all good friend stuff.
Okay, let me, uh, toss out a hypothetical to you, okay?
Nick has a piece of lint on his sleeve.
Do you go, "Hey, bud, you got some lint on your sleeve"?
Or do you pick it off?
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- Yes, you do.
Because you are a rabid watcher of The Crown.
- I watch a lot of shows.
- And so therefore, you know that picking lint off of a man's sleeve is the most intimate gesture.
I just leave it there.
A little piece of lint on his sleeve.
- I wouldn't do anything.
- What would you just want to Fine!
I'd want to pick it off with my bare hands!
Oh, my God.
I'm the girlfriend.
I'm so nervous for SOCALYALCON 6 that I lost my appetite.
But then I found my appetite, but now, now that I found my appetite, nothing sounds good.
Mm, sounds like you're in a complicated way, my man.
You know what actually does sound good?
The cake you made on the Fourth of July.
- Would you make it again?
- You want me to make a, uh, an American flag sheet cake in March?
Yes.
It'll be fun.
We'll do it together.
- You get to wear this.
- Okay.
My favorite apron.
You know what, no!
No, I'm not doing this anymore.
Anymore?
We've never made a cake together.
Wait, have we?
If we have, I don't remember.
I drink.
No, not no.
Not just this.
All of it.
All the girlfriend stuff.
It's not fair.
All right.
Sorry.
I-I didn't know you felt that way.
No.
(scoffs)
I don't feel that way, I - But you said unfair.
- Yeah, I did.
I said that 'cause I if I feel it is unfair.
To Reagan.
She's your girlfriend, I'm your good friend.
She, you know, she should she should get to make you sheet cake.
Yeah, that makes sense.
I just need to make something clear between us.
If that's okay.
You're saying "sheet" like "ghost clothes," not like "in a toilet," right?
Whoa.
I taught English in Japan for a couple years after college and I fell in with a bad crowd.
It was a time in my life I'm not proud of.
I fell in with with a Japanese game show crowd.
(speaking Japanese)
Which one?
- (speaking Japanese)
- This one?
This one or this one?
- I don't understand you!
- (crowd chanting in Japanese)
Okay.
(bell dinging, crowd cheering)
(announcer speaking Japanese)
(shouting in Japanese)
Oh, my God, I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
(yells)
I did it!
I was a ten-time top master champion on Protocol of Best Enjoyment.
- These are the spoils.
- Question is that hippo rideable?
(whoops, laughs)
(whoops)
Those day laborers were right.
This stuff is awesome.
Why was I so embarrassed for you to see it?
If this is your deep, dark, embarrassing secret, then I am worried for you to see what's buried in my storage unit.
I feel like I'm pretty up-to-date on your embarrassing secrets.
Oh, honey.
I have chapters in my life you know nothing about.
- Wait, really?
- Here we go.
I once sold knives door-to-door in high school.
And Byron Allen knocked me out.
Yeah, that was, like, the first thing you told me when we met.
Oh, yeah.
(laughs)
I do use that as an icebreaker, I forgot.
Well, here's one from deep in the storage unit.
Way in the back.
I once got my foot stuck in a go-kart.
- And I had to - Hop six laps alongside of it.
I've been kicked out of multiple focus groups for for crying too much.
That happened yesterday, and I was with you.
I fell asleep in study hall.
Had a very loud sex dream.
That happened to my family member, and I relayed the story to you.
- I fell asleep in a bathtub.
- Knew that.
And I once dislocated my thumb getting off a couch.
Okay, you got five more minutes on that hippo, and then we switch.
JESS: (groans)
What was wrong with me?
Well (chuckles)
nothing in this picture.
Hello, gorgeous.
Crop and keep.
(music playing nearby)
Reagan!
Hi.
How do you get off a plane and still look dewy as hell?
Uh, I made a deal with the devil some time ago.
(laughs)
- Hey, I'm the blue words.
- Too late.
We're going with it.
I picked you out Well, welcome back!
Sorry.
(chuckles)
I don't know why I'm still shouting.
Um, so Nick told me about what's been going on with you two.
Oh, he did?
- Listen, Reagan
- No, you listen to me.
The next time I find out that my man has been coming to you for cake I'm gonna take you out to dinner
- to say thank you.
- (chuckles)
Because I hate baking.
(both chuckle)
Speaking of dinner, why wait?
Why don't we do that tonight?
About Nick, um Jess, you don't have to change your relationship with Nick because of me.
I'm not a jealous person.
But thank you for thinking of me.
That's very nice.
You're a really good friend.
And that is why I got you this gift.
Oh, expensive jewelry.
(chuckles nervously)
Classic friend gift.
Thank you, friend.
But I don't have anything for you.
Except this nice wink.
And here it comes.
And bam.
(chuckles)
Oh, you're really tense.
Yeah, you don't have to do that.
My-my tension's what drives me.
- Oh, no, I want to.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't have a lot of friends that are girls.
- Mm.
- Oh, my God, I think you're my first girlfriend.
I'm sure you're missing someone, like, from high school or college.
Somebody?
A cousin?
WINSTON: That much is true SCHMIDT: All 22 points of entry locked.
- Good night, babe.
- Good night.
- Mm.
- Exhausted.
I know.
I feel so safe.
- So, here's the thing.
- (screams)
- Devil woman!
- How are you doing that?
I just had a four-hour dinner with Reagan.
At which, we shared something called "The Lovers' Pork.
" Cece, it's getting worse.
I'm both their girlfriends.
How did you get in here, Jess?
- Through the doggy door.
- There's a doggy door?
Well, it's flush with the people door, and it's painted shut, so I really had to put my head into it.
God, I don't want to be both their girlfriends.
Why do they both need me so much all of a sudden?
BOTH: All of a sudden?!
This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.
Even if nothing comes of it.
She came here to see you.
I bet you're reading into it.
What if I go talk to her?
So I fly you down, - you are my gift to Nick.
- I'm in.
Have you talked to Reagan about this?
I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.
Just tell him you believe in him and that he can do it.
Just go talk to Reagan.
So, work it out.
You know who you should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.
- No.
No.
- Nick!
(gasps)
Oh, my God.
It's not all of a sudden.
- They've needed me all along.
- SCHMIDT and CECE: Yeah.
- Am I the only reason they're together?
- SCHMIDT and CECE: Yeah.
Am I the architect of my own nightmare?
Okay, no, no, no, no, honey.
It's not like you introduced them or something.
Well, they did just get together because she left for jury duty.
I've pushed those two together like a god on Mount Olympus, too cheap to pay for p*rn.
No, no, no, it's like their relationship is a flood that's about to happen and you're the little Dutch boy with your thumb in the dike.
JESS: Well, no more.
I'm taking my thumb out of them.
(groans)
Is there anything other than Dutch boys or god p*rn?
I know, pandas.
I'm a zookeeper.
- They are my panda.
- What?
- What?
- Pandas wouldn't be alive without humans.
They can't run, they can't growl, they can't even mate without us.
Have you been helping Nick and Reagan mate?
In a way, yes.
But I'm done.
This zookeeper is through handing out bamboo.
Reagan and Nick deserve a chance to see if they can survive on their own.
Yes, and the zookeeper deserves a chance to be on a late night show with hilarious animals that poop on the host's - I don't what am I saying anymore?
- I don't know.
I don't even know.
Look, honey, you you deserve the right to do what's best for you.
Well (sighs)
that, too.
I saw a lizard once, uh, making diarrhea on Johnny Carson.
(Winston and Aly laughing)
TRAMPOLINE: You are number one supreme jumper!
Okay, I have, like, a million questions about what's going on here, but TRAMPOLINE: You are bouncer of much success!
- Yeah, we are!
- (grunts)
Could you guys stick around for a little bit?
- 'Cause I don't - TRAMPOLINE: You soar higher - than osprey and crane!
- Yes!
I don't want to be alone with Nick and Reagan.
TRAMPOLINE: You are gravity's master!
He weeps at your feet.
Okay, sure, Jess.
We don't have to be at the station till till, uh ALY: This just says we're ten days from a full moon.
Yeah, it's weird, I can't get mine out of scuba mode.
- I don't know how to read this.
- It's 11:45.
- What?!
- What?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
TRAMPOLINE: Farewell, emperors of trampoline.
Look, sorry, Jess, but we got to be at the station in less than 15 minutes.
Oh!
I just figured out something that you definitely do not know.
I blew my nose once and a bug came out.
We were all there when that happened.
That was at my birthday brunch.
Hey, Jess!
Oh, hey, guys.
I can't talk; I have so much paper to fold.
REAGAN: Well, you better get it all folded tonight, because guess where you are being whisked away to tomorrow.
(chuckles)
Palm Springs, California, where the only thing hotter than the weather are the gay senior citizens and SOCALYALCON 6.
Jess, we've been talking about how much we appreciate your friendship and how close we both feel to you, right?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, I, too, have, um, - felt that closeness, and, um - That's why we got you this.
Oh, no.
- That is for you now.
- No.
This and a necklace?
(chuckles)
Neck, neck, neck, neck, na-neck, neck, neck Neck's all loaded up.
Uh, but seriously, I can't accept this.
It's-it's too, um, expensive.
Money is no object.
That's why we rented a custom van, - and even got space radio.
- Satellite radio.
No, space radio, the one that connects to everything in the air.
- There's a satellite.
- What, the satellite's in the ground?
No, the satellite is in the air.
- Right.
Space.
Yeah.
- In the air.
Satellite radio.
And don't you worry about accommodations, because we also took care of that.
You got your very own hotel room.
It's adjacent to ours, but it's very private.
I mean, it is called a peekaboo suite, so there might be a little bit of crossover.
NICK: It's everything you like: it-it's kids, it's reading.
You are gonna get so many free bookmarks.
Do I get a per diem?
Yeah.
What's that?
- All right, doggy door.
- Sealed.
- Attic.
- Padlocked.
- Crawlspace.
- Uncrawlable.
The cast of Sneakers couldn't get into this place.
Uh Well, I guess I'm going to Palm Springs.
I just need your big-ass hat.
The front door.
Bye.
25 points of entry is too many points of entry!
- (door closes)
- How?
How?!
Wait, wait, don't tell me.
Agent Isosceles, part geometry prodigy, part CIA spy, all scared of girls.
- Wrong.
Cadet Isosceles.
- Oh.
It's all right.
You know, it's just, technically, this is just for myself (voice fading)
Wait.
Do you remember when you had to smuggle the golden sextant out of the Paris Math Academy?
- I do.
- I have a mission for you that is even more sensitive.
(grunting)
- Son of a - All right, this is the last of it.
Whew!
Are you sure we have to do this?
Babe, we're police officers who almost missed a shift because we were busy bouncing.
You're right.
Our capacity for joy is just way too high.
Okay, so I have one last secret.
So cute that you keep calling them secrets.
Just hear me out.
Um, I've lied to every girl I said "I love you" to.
I mean, I thought I loved them, but then I met you and realized I've never been in love before.
I did not know that.
Yeah, it was eating me up inside, so I called them each individually and said, "I never loved you.
" Okay.
Seems unnecessary.
One of them took it very badly.
Oh, one of them took it badly?
I mean, she's okay now.
Well, sort kinda.
She lives at the top of a very tall tree.
Maybe, like, run stuff like that by me.
Okay, let me just sign this right here.
Here you go.
My associate asked me to give this to one of you.
She had to go.
The rest is in the note.
Uh, it says, "I had to go.
Jess.
" Did she say any What's this book about?
Uh, it's I mean, it's it's hard to exp Reagan?
- Uh - Reagan, what is it Just tell her what it's about.
He wrote this book.
It's about a man with nothing, risking everything to feel something.
I'll take it.
Can you sign it?
"k*ll yourself.
" (chuckles)
It's a joke.
It's a reference to You'll get it.
(chuckles)
Hey, so how's SOCALYCAL SOCALYALCON 6?
JESS: I don't know.
I'm at the airport.
- What?
Where are you going?
- I don't know.
- How long you gonna be gone for?
- I don't know.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
I'm listening to your questions, I just don't know the answer to them.
I mean, this isn't like you; you always say if you had to choose between planning a trip or taking a trip, you'd choose planning.
And I stand by that.
I just, I really need a change of scenery.
I'm probably just gonna hang with my dad in Portland.
I did what you said.
I did what was right for me today.
I just don't know what's right for me tomorrow.
I do know that the prices of the tickets are not going down while we yap.
So I got to go.
I love you.
Bye.
- (ringtone playing)
- Oh, Cece, I'm fine I don't know why you disappeared, Jess, but you know what, I'm sure you'll fill me in back at the hotel.
Also, when I sign a book "k*ll yourself," you think they know that's a reference to Pepperwood's dilemma at the fish market, right?
Actually, you know what, that's a question for Reagan.
Okay, sorry.
See you later, Jess.
Cece, come check this out.
(locks clicking)
What?
Did that, did that just lock everything?
One touch secures every point of entry in the entire house, bringing us convenience and real-time peace of mind.
Okay, can I unlock it?
Well, unlocking it requires a pass code.
Ours is "my beautiful Cece," all one word.
- Very sweet.
- (phone chimes)
Oh, sh**t.
Actually, I screwed up.
Um, it's "my beautiful, beautiful Cece.
" - Two "beautifuls.
" - Okay.
(phone chimes)
(clears throat)
Oh, you know what, I know what it is.
Great, just put it in.
I'm freezing.
I can't.
It only gives you three tries, then it locks you out of the app for 12 hours.
- For 12 hours?!
- It's fine.
We'll go analog.
Give me your key.
Uh, I'd love to, but it's on the counter, next to yours.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.
I promise you, we'll figure this out.
- Override.
- (phone chimes)
- My beautiful, beautiful Cece.
- (phone chimes)
- Override.
Override.
- Oh, God.
(coughing)
- Were you in the chimney?
- (hacks)
Yes.
The 26th point of entry.
- (coughing)
- Oh, my God.
Also, we have squirrels.
Aw, I love squirrels.
They're not alive.
I counted at least nine of 'em.
- Oh, my God.
Cece - (knocking)
My beautiful, beautiful Cece
I need it.
I have a big day at work today.
I need it more.
I have to bake muffins before work.
- What?
Why?
- 'Cause it's for my "Lunch With Your Princi-Pal" campaign.
See, being principal's great, but unlike being vice principal, now the buck stops with me.
I'm "the Man" now, and all the kids can just smell "the Man" all over me.
That sounded really weird.
All I'm saying is, suddenly I have no relationship with the kids.
I'm really counting on these muffins to humanize me.
I deserve that coffee.
I'm finally director of marketing at Ass Strat.
Today I get to hire an assistant.
I'm gonna be tough, but I won't be a screamer.
It's not constructive, it's rude.
- Ooh, coffee.
- Your pour that coffee down, you throw it or I'll pour your blood on the ground!
- You'll pour my blood on the ground?
- I'll Kn*fe you!
Look, I got a full day of writing ahead of me, and that requires a fourth cup of joe.
What else is my whiskey gonna swim in?
You're taking this too far.
You treat that heart of yours like a baseball-man's mitt.
Uh, hello, I am the one packing for our move today, so I will be having, uh, the coffee.
(all clamoring)
- I get the coffee!
- Enough is enough with this!
- What are you doing here, Winston?!
- I get the coffee!
Enough!
You guys are tearing each other apart.
For what?
Coffee?
Come on, man, you already got that energy inside of you.
And that is the light of the Lord.
(chuckles)
Man, this?
This ain't nothing but the devil's water.
- Nah, I'm just playing.
- Hey, Winston!
- (all clamoring)
- Winston, that wasn't fair!
I'll Kn*fe you by the urinal, Winston!
Enough with the knifing.
Today's the day it all turns around.
- Hey.
- Sorr I'm sorry I h*t you, Jess.
I didn't mean to.
I'm using magnetic words to break through my writer's block, and it's not working.
I've already folded all my shirts and masturbated six times, and I'm running out of things to do.
I'm just in a real bind.
You see, The Pepperwood Chronicles sold over 30 copies, Jess.
So, what, we're complaining about good things now?
It's just, my audience is gonna be clamoring for a sequel, and I can't leave those stevedores, those-those tugboat workers, those lighthouse keepers empty-handed.
You think that your audience is entirely made of, like Blue-collar nautical workers on the coastline of Maine.
I don't think that, Jess, I know that.
Okay, Nick, you're incredibly talented.
You can do this.
And you have the key, - and the key is simply - (phone alarm beeping)
Oh.
I have to go.
Simply what?
Jess, simply what?!
- (door closes)
- (groans)
All right.
What do we have here?
"Sentient feces.
" Why is there a magnet that says "feces"?
All right.
Trust the process.
Ugh.
Thanks for helping me pack.
No problem.
This might be our last chance for a mess-around.
Don't you start with that last mess-around stuff.
- Don't you start.
- Don't start, 'cause then I'll start.
Look, I'm already starting.
Don't start.
- I didn't start this whole thing.
- I can't do it, okay?
(sighs)
Okay.
Okay, we agreed, let's just pack, okay?
Great.
- Furguson?
Where have you been?
- What?
Hi!
WINSTON: Huh?
When you leave the house, you take your cell phone with you.
Oh!
Oh, thank you so much for grabbing my cat.
Come on, Sweatshirt, there's still some sashimi left between my toes.
Uh, this here is, uh, Winston's cat, Furguson.
Sweatshirt walked through my door a year ago, and while he may come and go as he pleases, he loves Mommy and her little milkies.
Yes, he does.
- I'm his home.
- Oh, really?
So why do I have a photo of Furguson on my phone?
Oh, yeah?
Then why do I have a picture of Sweatshirt - on my sweatshirt?
- Oh, damn.
Furguson, you got you got two families, you dirty dog.
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I'm Winston.
This is Cece.
Name's Gil like the man's name, but for me.
Cornell.
Magna cum laude.
Two years of executive assistant experience.
Very nice.
Is this 24-pound linen stock?
- Uh, yeah, it is.
- Impressive.
Ken, do me a favor.
Will you, uh, untie your tie?
Uh, I can't, actually.
It's, um it's a clip-on.
I know.
Thanks so much, son.
See yourself out.
Next.
MAN: Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- My name is Jeremy.
Thank you.
Let me give you a scenario.
We land the Bronco Blue Jeans account and install Brett Favre as its face.
You receive a call from a nosy maÃ®tre d'.
It appears that Brett has been spotted at the Ritz-Carlton eating a salad, dressed in a tuxedo.
The paparazzi are on their way.
You rush in to alert me.
You find me d*ad.
What do you do?
I find a h*nky-tonk bar near the Ritz Carlton.
I leave a pair of perfectly broken-in Bronco Blue Jeans in Mr.
Favre's size, as well as a grass-stained T-shirt on the floor of the bathroom.
I get on the phone, rent a tractor, drive it directly into the swimming pool of the Ritz-Carlton.
When the staff is distracted, I physically subdue Mr.
Favre under the weight of my full body, look him in the eyes and tell him to repeat after me: "I got drunk playing football and remember nothing since.
"I would never knowingly wear a tuxedo, "drive a tractor into a swimming pool or eat a salad.
"And I would never knowingly "leave my Bronco Blue Jeans behind.
" - And the maÃ®tre d'?
- I rented the tractor in his name.
The next call he'll be making will be from the police station.
Welcome to Ass Strat.
Muffin?
Muffin.
They're homemade.
- Blueberry.
- You're so funny!
Look out, principal's coming!
(chuckles)
Bah.
Just kidding.
Muffin?
Are you calling me Muffin or offering me one?
Either way, no.
Okay.
Well, cool, cool, cool, cool.
I think Bayou Sue sent the letter Sorry, what did you say?
Sorry.
Are we in trouble?
No, I just Did you say Bayou Sue?
She's just a character in this book that we're obsessed with.
Yeah, Pepperwood Chronicles.
Anyway, you probably wouldn't know anything about it.
I put a couple copies in the library, and the librarian didn't think it'd go anywhere.
(chuckles)
I can't wait to rub it in Esther's smug face.
- That's very flattering.
- Please come and talk to these girls.
They're obsessed with Pepperwood.
I don't have time for this.
I'm only on page two.
And page one is just a dedication to Winston.
Ugh.
Come on.
The kids used to love Vice Principal Jess, and now they won't have anything to do with Principal Jess.
It's like I'm living in my own damn adorable shadow.
Please?
You-you might get some ideas from your audience.
My audience is the men who built this great country.
Your students would never understand that Pepperwood's just a New Orleans story about a guy fighting with the alligator within.
Well, could you just do it for me?
Yeah, I'll.
.
I mean, I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.
Well, then why didn't you You know what, I'm happy with where we ended up, but you took me on a real spin around the block there.
So, as you can see here, I treat Furguson right.
- Mm-hmm.
- WINSTON: Okay?
- Organic kitty litter.
- Mm-hmm.
I got the miniature piano, the tiny, tiny treadmill, and right over here is where we do couples yoga.
(gags)
Fish nuggets?
Oh, well, that would explain his recent oily eliminations, which I document on the cloud.
You track his poop?
What, you just weigh his hairballs and clock out?
- I mean, I - Furguson is happy here, okay?
(voice breaks): Around people that actually cherish him.
- Don't you start, Cece.
- And who helped him become the cat that he is.
- Now ain't the time.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.
Now ain't the time.
- What's happening?
- CECE: I'm trying, okay?
I've just got to breathe for a second.
Let me explain something to you, okay?
Furguson is my cat.
I found him first.
Well, you may have found Furguson, but Sweatshirt found me.
I see you want to play hardball here.
- How about this?
- Mm-hmm.
We settle things the way we do on the street.
- Mm-hmm.
- Catcall.
- What?
- We let Furguson decide.
- Oh, yeah.
- Fine.
We'll leave the decision in his paws.
Which are now incredibly strong, thanks to his new set of, uh, mini-dumbbells.
- You're welcome.
- (chuckling)
Ooh, ooh!
Okay, Pepper-heads!
Get ready for a memorable experience, which I hope you will recount at your weddings, which I will also be at, brought to you by your favorite principal-slash-friend, Jessica Day.
Please welcome your favorite author, Nick Miller!
- (girls cheering)
- Yay!
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
All right, let's get this over with.
Uh, let's talk about the book you guys most certainly don't understand because it wasn't written for you or people your age.
Go ahead.
- The kissing.
- OMG, the romance.
- The make out scene at the levee.
- Oh, the romance.
Guys!
Pepperwood's about way more than just a romance.
It's it's, uh, it's about life, you know?
Race.
The sexualization of the American g*n.
- (whispers): Keep it clean.
- Okay.
It's a story about his ambiguous relationship with with justice.
But the romance is amazing.
It made me realize it doesn't matter if I'm straight or gay; I'm just me.
You got that from my book?
That's yeah.
That was positive.
Do you think that's because of the gay dog character?
- Yeah.
- What I really respect about that is it's never mentioned that he's a gay dog.
But you got that from the writing.
And that's pretty dope.
You write female desire so well.
- Thank you.
- That's okay to say, right?
Yah, Ramona.
I'm-I'm just like you.
I'm your princi-pal.
I'm your friend.
I like to just throw on my rollerblades, and just go out there and think.
NICK: Can I ask you guys about the scene - in the fish morgue?
- Oh, my God, - that was my favorite chapter.
- Mine, too.
- I read it, like, five times.
- Yeah, same!
(mouthing)
- What?
- I stayed up all night.
It was such a good chapter.
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
You're welcome.
Why'd you whisper it?
Jeremy, I'm just gonna go grab a coffee, - and then I will - Dark roast, soy creamer, 160 degrees.
- How was your lunch, sir?
- Disappointing.
Why don't you eat the homemade bucatini I brought for myself?
Well, thank you, Jeremy.
Um, you know, - I'm not getting e-mails on my - (phone beeps)
I just got an e-mail on my phone.
It's from you.
"Subject: Your e-mail is now working.
" All right.
Well, Jeremy, I'm just gonna go enjoy this bucatini and, uh, organize the Peterson account.
- I did it already.
- You did?
- Okay.
I guess I'll just - Enjoy your lunch.
Yeah.
So you're saying that Lady Diamante doesn't realize that it's Pepperwood's underwear for years later, like, 20 years later?
Maybe she never realizes.
Yes.
That's what I was gonna say, too.
We you and me, we're right here.
- All right.
- (school bell rings)
Wow.
This is incredible.
I mean, so many great ideas here.
It feels like maybe The Pepperwood Chronicles could be, like, a whole series.
Well, I mean, it's called The Pepperwood Chronicles, so I assumed there'd be more than one.
Yeah, well, I can't thank you guys enough.
- All right, I'll see you at home.
- Home?
- You guys live together?
- Yeah, we're roommates.
Yeah.
This job doesn't pay very much, but it's very rewarding to hang out with cool people like you guys.
You guys are actually, like, friends?
You ready to get your mind really bl*wn off?
We used to date.
- (girls exclaiming)
- Oh, yeah.
- Like, a whole thing.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, we were in love.
Everything, yeah.
For a while.
(chuckles)
All right, I'll see you at home.
Yeah, it was crazy.
- See you, guys.
- Wow.
You went from kind of "meh" to sort of cool to totally the coolest ever.
I don't want to freak you out, but that really means a lot to me.
- All right, let's get to class.
- Let's get a picture with PJ.
- Uh, what?
PJ?
- (camera clicks)
Yeah, Principal Jess.
Much as I'd love to foster your creativity, I think maybe Principal Jess or Principal Day Let's not even go to class.
(laughter)
Let's go to the drama room and dress up like old men.
- PJ don't care.
- Oh, PJ do care.
PJ do care.
I mean, your principal does care.
How about we write a report on Pepperwood?
You're hilarious.
Yeah.
You know I'm serious about the report.
Don't walk away from me.
Okay.
Well, walk away.
Just turn to the left.
Point me out to your friends.
Laugh a, laugh a little bit.
Okay.
Yeah.
Keep going.
All right, I've totally lost control.
Ugh!
Damn it!
- Nick, I have to get to school!
- I know.
So do I.
I can't wait to pitch those girls my Pepperwood prequel.
It opens with a very graphic description of his birth.
- It's like a dark Look Who's Talking.
- No, no, no, no, Nick.
You're not coming back to school with me.
You made me look way too cool.
The girls told the whole school.
I've lost all my authority.
(lively music playing, kids whooping)
This is my office.
I got invited to that, too.
The girls asked me to deejay at their dance party.
They call me DJ PJ.
They love you.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Ah, it's a tricky balance.
I don't want to be the heavy, but I need them to listen.
Those girls have such good ideas.
I've got to put the genie back in the bottle.
- (phone vibrates)
- Ugh!
See, this is what I mean.
They added me to a text chain about who has the cutest butt in school.
- And?
- It's Nurse Mike.
- Interesting.
- (door closes)
Oh, you know what?
If it's always gonna be empty, let's just fill it with goldfish.
- So dramatic.
- (phone chimes)
Jeremy texted me and he left an ice coffee in the fridge.
It's like this guy's in my mind.
It's also like he's in our kitchen when we're sleeping.
(clicking tongue)
Can I come help you pack?
Jeremy's done everything around here.
Actually, I'm not packing, I'm just, uh, - hanging out with Winston.
- I'm so bored, Cece.
Please.
I'm desperate.
Are you guys having one of those mess-downs?
I could come be part of that.
Sir, I believe the correct term is "mess-around.
" Okay.
Jeremy, enough.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
That'll be all.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
(sighs)
- JEREMY: Did you say something?
- Jer-Jeremy!
Enough!
Dear Lord.
You know, I wanted an assistant that was gonna anticipate my every need so I wouldn't have to yell, but now I'm yelling, because I have an assistant that's anticipating my every need, and I can't breathe!
Work isn't everything, man.
Just go meet yourself a girl.
Or a, or a man.
I don't know what you're into.
You're very hard to read sexually.
But please, Jeremy.
That'll be all.
- Thank you.
- Sorry, sir.
WINSTON and CECE: Furguson.
Hey, boy.
- Sweatshirt.
Sweatshirt.
- Furgie.
- Whee!
- Ah, there we go.
Hey, remember all of the good times we had?
- So may good times.
- Huh?
WINSTON: What about one of those times we wore the same shirt?
- CECE: Custom shirts.
- (laughs)
Dad of the year.
- Dad of the year.
- GIL: Come on, Sweatshirt.
Hey, what about the time that we geeked out on mayonnaise?
Or how 'bout when we drove to the airport and kissed, watching the planes take off.
- You did what?
- Remember that?
- She's moving.
She's moving closer.
- No, no, no.
If you're moving - then we get to come closer, too.
- Yeah.
We're coming closer, too.
Sweatshirt Hey, boy.
- Furguson.
- (sniffing)
- What?
- I don't know.
Someone has crab in their pocket.
- Oh, my God, that's insane.
- Yeah, time-out.
- (sniffing continues)
- That's totally crazy.
Excuse Okay how does Okay, just (gasps)
- Cheater!
- Oh.
Okay, well, that is from a salad I had earlier, and it must've just fallen into my pocket.
Cece.
I can't believe you did this.
It's just (sighs)
Okay.
This is gonna be our last mess-around before I leave, and I just don't want Furguson to leave you, too.
Just because you stop living together doesn't mean you stop caring about somebody.
Because caring that is the real mess-around.
Come on.
(crying softly)
Winnie.
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie!
(gasping)
- Oh, my God.
- (gasps)
WINSTON: He chose.
- Ha!
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha-ha, you see?
- Ha-oh!
- The crab claw didn't matter.
- Mm-mm.
WINSTON: Furgie chose.
Outta sight!
(laughs)
Come here, my man.
Ah!
(laughing)
Aw.
Well, I suppose what's done is done.
He's all yours.
Good-bye, Sweat (sighs)
Good-bye, Furguson.
Yeah.
(chuckles softly)
Do you guys think it's cool or weird if, uh, Pepperwood has a peg leg?
Where we at on that?
I'm afraid it might make him too vulnerable.
I just don't see it that way.
I think it makes All right.
No peg leg, I guess.
Excuse me!
There's an assembl Nick!
What the hell is going on here?
Oh, PJ in the house!
My office.
Now.
Oh, PJ's gonna bust somebody.
You're the most in trouble.
But they started it!
I didn't even do any Gah!
You had an unsupervised meeting with the students.
You're wearing home slippers - on school grounds.
- (scoffs)
Home slippers.
You parked in Janitor Margie's parking spot.
And, by the way, she pissed.
- And she ain't small.
- It's a dirt patch.
And you ladies, you skipped an assembly for Pepperwood!
What's the big deal, PJ?
Yeah, you're kind of being a bitch.
This is unacceptable.
I don't want to be your enemy, but I also don't need to be your friend.
So you guys don't get to write to your international pen pals for a month.
You've all lost your community garden privileges.
Two weeks' suspension from the freestyle poetry slam.
And I'm calling all of your parents.
Spread the word!
Principal Day is done messing around.
Now get out.
(phone beeps)
Oh, my God, they work fast.
When did they even take this picture?
Well, apart from the devil horns, it's a pretty good picture of you, Jess.
That's true.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
The truth is-is you are exactly who I was when I was your age.
I was hungry.
I was putting in 22 hours a day.
Once worked four days straight without water.
Wow.
And I just wish that somebody had taken me aside and told me that there was another way.
Would you have listened?
(sighs)
- Probably not.
- Then I won't either.
In fact, you're not even talking to Jeremy right now.
- Okay, well, then who am I talking to?
- The younger you telling you to take advantage of your new super cool assistant so you can get to the next floor and the next floor and the next floor, and the next floor and the next floor, - and now we're on top!
- And now we're on top!
I'm liking this side of you, Jeremy.
Yeah, let's stay hungry.
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna work on the McCormick presentation.
Now I actually am hungry.
Let's order some food.
Already done, sir.
Arigato.
(speaking Japanese)
All right, now.
Take it down a notch.
Yeah.
If you're here to complain about your punishment, save your breath.
My decision's final.
Actually, we were just wondering if we could sit down with you for a second.
- Sure.
- We're sorry about being so disrespectful, Principal Day.
Well, I appreciate that.
If anyone wants a muffin, I I have an extra one.
GERTIE: Here.
We got you a gift card to a coffee shop.
It's really close to your route to school.
Well, that's not necessary.
Th-Thank you.
That's RAMONA: We know you have a lot of roommates, and some of them are brilliant authors working from home, creating great chronicles.
But they can make their own coffee.
Well, that feels oddly on the nose.
We have the upmost respect for you.
Sorry, did you just say "upmost"?
- Oh, that is good.
- JESS: Nick!
I can't condone you making contact with my students.
- What?
- That said thanks for putting them up to it.
Jess, I don't know what you're talking about.
"Upmost"?
There's only one person I know that says "upmost.
" - It's "utmost.
" - "Utmost"?
- "Utmost.
" - (chuckles)
Agree to disagree.
But the good news is my writer's block is gone, and that is thanks to you.
You always come through for me, Jess, to the upmost.
I assure you, it's "utmost.
" - What's an "ut"?
- Come on, you're a writer.
It's "up.
" Up to the most.
Not ut to the most.
I assure you.
- Okay, sweetie.
- You didn't come in here and say, "Thanks for putting them ut to it.
" I would've laughed you out of here.
What is an "ut"?!
WINSTON: Furguson is miserable.
JESS: So you're saying that this is a different emotion than we've seen for the past three years?
A father knows.
He misses Gil.
It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.
I mean, I already took away his testicles.
Anyway, (sighs)
let me just Proud of you.
(sighs)
You won't need the key I gave you.
And the door always gonna be open.
You're not gonna, like, leave the door open always, right?
He'll be back.
What the hell?
- Jeremy.
- Oh, my God.
He came back.
Come on.
What the hell is this man doing in our house?
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Jeremy.
I'm the executive assistant to your husband and my boss, Mr.
Schmidt.
Oh, are you the one who called and asked me about my blood type?
He's very thorough.
Actually, he's going to need everyone's blood type.
- You're not getting my blood.
- That's super weird.
- Yeah.
- Oh, hell no.
I do have individual coffee orders.
You can tell which one's which based off the caricatures I drew on the cups.
That's you.
This is shockingly accurate.
And you've never met us.
- I mean, how did you do that?
- Nailed it.
- Very creepy.
- That's pretty good.
(chuckles)
CECE: Is he ever gonna leave?
SCHMIDT: I don't think so.
I can't believe we still haven't told them.
I guess it just was never the right time.
Well, I guess we're simply out of time.
(phone rings)
- You're on with Schmidt and Cece.
- Ruth's on!
JESS: Hey, you're on with Jess and Nick. I'm patching in
Winston, Aly and Dan Bill.
Are we really calling him Dan Bill?
It sounds like a weird town in Connecticut.
It's their child. Their mistake to make, okay?
- (Muzak playing)
- Mm. That's a nice touch.
CECE: Yeah, good vibe, good vibe.
- Hella?
- JESS: It's Jess and Nick.
- I'm patching in Schmidt, Cece and Ruth.
- (beeps)
Cece, Schmidt and Ruth, you're on with Jess, Nick,
Winston, Aly and Dan Bill.
- Hey, Jess, Nick, Dan Bill...
- Hey, Winston, Dan Bill...
- Winston and Aly.
- Jess and Nick.
Who are these people?
Hey, Schmidt, Cece, Ruth, Jess and Nick.
JESS: Guys, I only have the strength
to say this once.
Here I go.
Oh, God, how do I put this into words?
Okay, make it quick, 'cause my phone is at four percent,
and Ruth has turned my charger into a very sensible belt.
Schmidt, just switch your phone to low battery mode.
It really lengthens battery life.
How do you do that? Walk me through it.
- Go to Utilities.
- No, no, Settings. Go to Settings.
Okay, well, I'm-I'm in Settings.
- Guys, please...
- Oh, sh**t. Now I'm at three percent.
I have something important to say!
WINSTON: And then, uh, open your Control Center.
- Battery. Select Battery.
- Enough!
- Oh, no, I got it.
- Jess has something really important to say, so everybody shut up!
Jess, go ahead.
(groans)
I can't tell you this over the phone.
Get over here before it's too late.
She can tell you, she can tell you. Go ahead.
- Bye.
- Oh! What a waste of...
Good job.
- What is it?
- You're getting divorced?
Well, that lasted a month.
What? No! Jess, go ahead.
I hate to be the bearer of truly terrible news...
Jess, can you please tell us? I'm so scared.
You should be. This is...
(sighs) this is life-changing stuff.
Brace yourselves.
Nick and I are...
moving out of the loft.
- That's it?
- Okay.
SCHMIDT: That's what you called us here for?
Why do you always think like a character
- in The Baby-Sitters Club?
- (Cece sighs)
Okay, okay, you guys process this
however you need to.
You're probably wondering why we would ever move out
- in the first place.
- Yeah, honey, you should've moved out
when the elevator plunged into the basement
- and k*lled the mailman.
- We got an eviction notice.
They're kicking us out in    hours.
Some evil company called Engram Pattersky Management Group
bought the building.
Yeah, they're kicking us out on our... "too-tookuses."
You trying to say "tuchases"?
"Tuchaseses."
- "Tuchas"?
- "Tookases."
Luckily, Nick and I found a very nice two-bedroom
with a lovely reading nook. That doesn't matter.
The point is, we're moving out tomorrow,
and I know how much this place means to you guys, so...
whatever you're thinking or feeling,
I want you to get it out.
So whoever wants to go first...
Okay, I don't think you guys fully heard me.
(chuckles) So I'm gonna say it again.
Nick and I are m...
...moving out of the loft.
Okay, if you're moving out tomorrow,
why have you not packed yet?
Don't packing-shame us!
We're well on our way.
We got four boxes right there.
I ran out of tape, so I started using glue.
We'll see how it holds up.
Cool. Anyway, uh, I'm taking off.
Hey, let me know when you have the housewarming
for your new place. I'll bring the succulents.
You never brought us succulents. We love succulents.
Ah, you got me. I don't know what a succulent is.
I just said that so I can get the hell out of here. (chuckles)
But I really do got
to get going. It's my turn to nurse the baby.
- How does he...
- It's a whole thing.
Wow, you guys are in so much denial. You're so upset
by this news that you're distracting yourself
with nonsense like-like succulents and newborn babies.
Uh, we left Ruth with our neighbor's stepson, Yonk,
so we're gonna go.
CECE: Yeah, honey, we're not in denial, okay?
We've just done everything we need to do in this loft.
We're ready to say good-bye.
Right. Right. Yeah.
Yeah, Cece, you're right. You're totally right. You're all...
totally right.
Or are you wrong?!
Nobody leaves until we celebrate this place!
(groaning)
Okay? So call your sitters, call your babies,
get all your affairs in order.
I'm gonna go open a bottle of wine. Pink okay?
Well, I guess I'll call Yonk and tell him to get cozy.
- (groans)
- Ugh, I can hear Yonk now.
(with accent): "Mr. Schmidt, I got thirsty.
I drank all your coconut water."
Freakin' Yonk.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Okay, why are we hiding in your office?
Because, guys, look, I love my wife.
You guys know that I love my wife. But she's clearly going
through something about us leaving the loft. It's like...
it's like she's having a really hard time getting her mouth
around the sandwich, do you know what I mean?
If you guys want to get out of here, which I know you do,
then you will laugh when she says laugh,
you will cry when she says cry,
and in between, we're gonna pack.
I really miss the old days when I would just drop in
every now and then and pick up a suitcase or something.
I only have the moving truck for    hours.
If I go one minute over,
those bastards will charge me for a whole nother day.
If you get a whole nother day, might as well get a second week.
You get a second week, you might as well buy the truck,
'cause you're livin' in it, Charlie! You live in a mo...
The point I'm trying to make is we need to pack right now.
I love packing.
You wouldn't believe how good I am
at fitting multiple things into small spaces.
- I'm a bento box boy.
- (chuckling)
- What's in that box?
- What?
What's the box that says "gross stuff," man?
Jessica's underpants.
SCHMIDT: You have Jess's panties in a box?
Well, while I'm delighted
that you have a box...
labeled "gross stuff" of your wife's...
undergarments, uh,
I also feel like you may be lying to me.
JESS: Yoo-hoo, guys! Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-frickin'-hoo!
Just remember, if you want to get out of here, play along.
♪ ♪
Behold!
Objects from your past to make you remember and...
Oh, God, the chair is still spinning. Oh, my God.
You guys, I'm on a dolly.
I'm on a greased up dolly, and I'm holding f*re.
Guys, guys, guys, guys...
If we scatter now, one of us can get out
and bring help for the rest.
Take in the memories.
Let these objects be the milkshake
that bring your memory boys to the emotion yard.
- I swore we threw all this stuff away.
- Wow, I can't believe you
- saved all this stuff. How cool is that?
- But we're really happy it's back.
- We're all really happy. Thank you.
- Yeah.
I knew you guys needed to say good-bye.
(chuckles) Isn't it amazing how easy it is
to do the right thing when you have no other alternative?
Totally. (chuckles)
Like this.
Ah, the old loft candy dish.
(inhales deeply)
That's the cast from when I broke my penis.
(screams) Shut up!
You know, most people wouldn't want to revisit
some of the more painful moments in their lives, but,
you know what, Jess, thank you for this, 'cause I do.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Schmidt, you take that.
- (stammers)
- You're gonna want it.
Honestly, it's your penis. You earned it.
- Put it in your purse.
- Excuse me?
- Go put it in your purse.
- I am not putting it in my purse.
- Please, Cece, just put it in your purse.
- I am not gonna go put it...
- We'll just leave it here.
- We'll put it right there.
Remember this?
- NICK: Oh! Looks just like us!
- (Cece laughs)
- We always pose like that.
- Can we talk about those skin tones?
Oh, Nick, this one is so special.
- WINSTON: Wow.
- The wand I used to fix the, uh,
garbage disposal. That one time.
(voice breaking):
Did we find the garbage wand
or did the garbage wand find us?
I remember the day I found it. I thought,
"Free stick."
- Ha!
- Then I brought it home,
and it fit into the sink hole.
- Mm.
- And somewhere along
the way, it fixed my heart hole.
- It fixed your heart hole?
- So, thank you, stick.
- SCHMIDT: Okay.
- CECE: I have a tear.
- WINSTON: That about sums it up.
- Yeah.
Jess, I will never,
ever forget the night that you brought us
all together to show us a bunch of our old trash.
- CECE: We should let you pack.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so...
- No!
- Huh?
No one's going anywhere.
We're gonna do all the things in the loft
that we haven't done before.
- Like what?
- (scoffs)
I can't believe we've never all stood out
on the balcony together.
You know who else liked balconies? h*tler.
Let's go inside. Let's do more things.
I can't believe you've never cleaned the oven, Cece.
I think, I think if we just do this,
and this, and turn it up real high...
I heard that that could work.
Yeah. What else should we do?
We could all just pack and move Jess and I
out of the loft; we've never done that.
It's a joke. It's a joke for sentimentals.
- It's a sentimental joke.
- Oh. I know.
Th-This is a big one.
You know, I've never looked around the corner,
in the hallway past the bathroom. Like, what's over there?
Oh my God, what is over there?
- What is over there?
- Yeah.
- Whose team are you on?
- I play for myself.
It's just a wall.
My turn. Cece and I need to use the urinals.
Follow me.
Oh, n-n-no, no, no, no, no.
You just opened Pantera's box.
We do not have time for this right now.
We will get in...
Peppermint lotion?
It's for your feet.
Yay. I love it.
I knew it!
- Nailed it.
- Great gift.
Oh, I'm gonna get you one every year.
And we're gonna be best friends forever.
I just met you, like, a week ago.
Uh, just 'cause it says "peppermint,"
non-edible.
I never would have thought to eat this lotion.
Nicholas, I have been giving you that lotion
- every year since we met.
- I know.
I wanted you to experience soft feet for once in your life,
- and you... and you lied to me.
- What did you want me to do?
I had just met you when you first gave it to me.
Then you actually gave me the lotion again the following year.
And the lie got on top of me. And now I got all these bottles
of lotion and I don't even know how to do this stuff.
You don't know how to "do" foot lotion?
What if I put it on and my feet get...
I don't know, too wet and creamy?
Has everything been a lie? Has this whole relationship...?
Don't call it a relationship, it's a friendship.
Don't belittle what we have by calling it a friendship.
- No, please.
- Oh, we don't love each other in Chicago.
We're just friends.
Please, just get over this and help me pack.
Sure. You've lied to me for years,
but let's just ignore it so I can help you pack
while humoring your wife
- pretending to care.
- JESS: What?
You guys were humoring me?
Nick, you told everyone to pretend to care?
Jess, it's not about that. It's about the truck.
I didn't want to go a minute over the    hours,
because then I, you know, I need to pay for a second day.
Jess.
Wait, Jess. I'm sorry.
You guys were just playing along with this?
I thought you were just starting to feel something.
Wait. Am I the one who's in denial about leaving this place?
Ugh, you sweet, goblin-eyed dum-dum.
CECE: Babe, I think the rest of us
have already made peace with this.
No, I get it.
I'm not mad. I just...
People live together in apartments all the time.
And you guys have lives and kids.
And this is just a place.
But to me, this is the place where I met all of you.
- And that's...
- (sighs)
...that's the best thing that...
that ever happened to me, so...
Consider yourselves freed.
The lock never really worked, anyway.
Put that down.
We are not going anywhere.
Yeah, we're gonna say good-bye all day.
All day.
- All day!
- What?
- That's not it.
- You don't say it like that.
It's like, all day.
- All...
- All day!
Guys, second day
- of a moving truck on me.
- CECE: There we go.
- SCHMIDT: That's a big step.
- Thank you.
But I'm not doing the insurance. I won't do it. I can't do it.
- It's a rip-off. It's a freakin' rip-off.

that was one of your top five boners of all time.
Do you remember you used to rank them?

Anyway, man, I just wanted to say, uh...
Oh.

I'm done.
Well, it's just lotion. It ain't gonna hurt you, now.
(chuckles) Yeah, go ahead. Slap it in there.
Wow, it's so frickin' creamy.
This is what I've been telling you.
It's really cool.
- It actually kind of feels nice.

I mean, I got to say, I really like foot lotion.
Thank you.
They should make more foot lotion for your hand.
Foot lotion hand.
Or... foot-lotion hand.
I don't know.
You should use this for elbows.
You should use lotion for dry parts of your skin.
(chuckles)
It's really creamy.
For the first time in my life,
I realize my feet could be more than w*apon.
I love you, man.
Oh, yeah, that's...
Well, yeah, man. I, uh...

Guys, don't-don't put any pressure on him.
No, what? Dude, you're not putting pressure on me.

I don't need to say anything. I want to say it.

- Go, Nick!

Winston, sit down! The topics for Big Dinner have already been decided.
As you all know, Aly and I have recently become engaged.

I receive all that love, and then I give it right back.
Anyway, as we were saying...
I got to finish this.
It's really important. In order to get married, I have commenced divorce proceedings... with my wife...
Rhonda, yeah.

And you you're not supposed to say "ding, ding, ding" when you ding, ding, ding.
Schmidt: Guys, please.
These are all common topics.
This is why I proposed Common Lunch, but nobody showed up.
Don't yell at us 'cause you guys are freaking out about your new jobs.
I am not freaking out.
I have been preparing for this job ever since I was young enough to believe (chuckles): leprechauns were real.

So did I.
No, you said "boy ride."

Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna cry.

Rhonda: Hello, Winston.
Hey, Rhonda.
You wanted to sign the divorce papers, and-and I thought this was... this was a good a time as any.
But I know it's a shock, but... meet your son.
Oh, my God.
Um...

I will never do that to you.

That is amazing!
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can feel my heartbeat through the back of my head!
You just took years off my life!
You are the master!
Where'd that baby come from?
Oh, he came from Dave.
Who's Dave?
Hi-yo!
Dave, take a bow.
Thank you. Uh, thank you.
Rhonda: This is my cousin.
I'm staying with him while I'm in town.
So he's your baby?

I'm an obstetrician.
I just borrowed this little guy.

Rhonda, I'm Aly, Winston's fiancée.
It's so nice to meet you, I think.

Rumspringa.
Boy ride.
Rumspringa is a hallowed Amish tradition, not a one-day buddy comedy.
Second of all, I don't want to go to a casino or a sexual petting zoo.
That is why we are taking you to the old-timey Danish town oddly located in California's wine country.

Jess: Candy apples, windmills, no minorities.
Great Rumspringa, guys! I'm gonna h*t the road.

I just got a vision for my room. Excuse me.
Okay, I got to go home, and I got to work on my morning announcement voice.

I think the last one was close.
I really think you're overthinking this.
Just do what I do... exude confidence all the time.
But you're the boss now. You... you can't skate by on confidence alone.
Who says I can't?
Well, I couldn't get away with it.
I'd always be worried that someone would figure out I didn't know what I was doing.
I'd be terrified as hell.
Nah. I'm good.
I'm so good.
Well, I'm not.
I have to go home and work on my blazer.
So I found a bus ticket back...
Well, hold on.

Are there folksy, old-timey reenactors here?
'Cause that would be, like, a total freaking game changer.

What?
Pranks at 50, pranks at 60, Aly, ignore her. pranks at 80.
Pranks in the nursing home.
We'll figure something out.
Hey, you're small.
What?
I'm looking for somebody small for a prank I'm cooking up.
(exhales)
Actually, I could use all of you.
Winston: Okay, look. Rhonda, yeah. This won't work.
Aly, you don't have to do this.
Rhonda: If you do this for me, I'll give you your divorce.
If this is what I have to do to marry you, then...
Rhonda, the three of us will do your prank.
Cece: Wait, what? I have in no way consented to this.
Gonna do a group Rhonda! That's awesome.
Uh, how do you feel about having a bunch of jelly on your head?
Not good, Rhonda.
Hey, Jess.
Mm.
Could you make a pillow out of this?
You know damn well I could make a pillow out of anything.
Definite buy, bro. Aquavit me.
I'm thinking of making a throw pillow for my room.
Uh, teenagers don't have throw pillows, right?
Whoa. Why you packing up? It's only 4:30.
Yeah, it's Sunday.
Everything around here closes pretty early.
Sundays.
I'm just getting my rum sprung!
Stinks.
What am I gonna do, Nick?
I don't...
Nick, I don't think I'm ready for this new job.
I'm freaking out. And there's not enough aebleskivers in this whole place to soothe me.
It's not over. Give me a second.
Give me a second.
I think I know how to keep this party going just a little bit longer.
Welcome to the distillery.
I'm gonna, uh, make sure that, that's okay.
Oh, you know what? It's, um, it's probably just an old-timey Danish door.
You just need to jiggle the, um, the dorhandtag.
Yeah. I'm doing that.
Maybe there's another door.
(jiggling door knob)
No, that's it.
Are we trapped?
Wiggle the dorhandtag!
It won't budge! It's locked!
I'll make a call!
Oh, my God.
And there's no service!
Let us out! We have a big day tomorrow, we need to pupate.
They don't know what that means.
Say something more accessible.
Help!
They have Wi-Fi.
(Jess and Schmidt yelling)
But I don't know the password!
I'm on a real roller coaster of emotions right now.
Just slamming up and crashing down!
Jess: Come on, help us, Danes!
Unlike in World w*r II!
Yeah, I brought it up!
Darn it!
What are we gonna do?
We've been stuck in here for over an hour!
Okay, yes. Our bodies are trapped in this cellar, but our minds can go anywhere.
We have to start new jobs tomorrow.
Don't you know who I am? I'm the director of marketing for Associated Strategies!
Hey, Schmidt. It seems like you might need a Rumspringa.
Want to go to a casino?
Pick a number. Any number, kiddo.
What?
Pick a number.
I don't understand this...
23.
That's wrong.
Fun, though, huh?
How am I wrong?
Was it 19?
It was...
He doesn't need a Rumspringa!
He needs to get out of this cellar.
I think you're looking at it wrong.
There's still so much fun to be had in here.
For example, in three minutes, a bird is gonna pop out of that clock.
A bird?
Just gonna pop its head out.
Why wait?
What do you mean, why...
(cuckoo clock chiming)
Son of a...
Look, there. I got the bird.
Isn't this fun?
I told you I didn't want a Rumspringa.
This might've worked when you were 20, but we're adults now, and you can't handle adult problems by forgetting about them.
You're right.
Maybe I handle my problems like a child.
Maybe I decorate my room like a child.
I mean, I even undress like a child.
(grunting)
Do you think that's what Reagan was getting at about my room?
Yeah.
Do you think Reagan thinks I'm a child?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now I'm freaking out!
And I'm usually the rock of this group.
Once you lose old Nicky Miller, the whole thing falls apart.
Winston: Aah.
Aah, okay.
Cece: She's gonna pop!
How far apart are the contractions?
Who's asking?
I don't know.
Let's take a look.
(screams)
Wah. I'm a baby.
Oh!
I'm, I'm... coming out.
Uh-uh.
I, I know.
I'm rattled, too.
You just got Rhonda'd!
That's for not coming to the family reunion.
I'm so sorry. We got Rhonda'd.
Uh, Dave?
Hello. I, for one, would like to say I'm sorry.
Did not want to participate in this at all.
(Rhonda and Dave laugh)
Dave: You're crazy.
You got me good!
Oh, God.
W-what's happening?
My, my skin... it's burning.
What? What's going on?
The goop, it's burning my skin.
What?
Do something. My skin's burning, you guys.
What? Baby, baby, you okay?
What did you put on me?
What did you do to her, Rhonda?!
Ow!
She didn't want the jelly, so I used a porcine birthing agent.
What is that?!
I... I...
Well, it's burning!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
You're sorry?!
I...
You should be... because, baby doll, you just got Aly'd.
Oh!
Oh!
Ooh!
How you like that, Rhonda?
Who's basic now?
What?
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Winston: Oh, my God, I thought you were about to die. My heart...
She good.
I d*ed.
How could you... do something... so amazing?!
(Rhonda shouts)
Just kind of thought of it on the spot.
Oh, now, not only will you get a divorce, you have my blessing.
Put your hands away. Nobody's asking for it.
We don't need that.
(broken clock whirring)
Jess: Well... it's 4:00 a.m.
It's official.
I'm missing my first day as principal.
Got a fresh toilet for you guys. (clears throat)
Ration them.
Guys, don't give up hope.
Well, I'm fine being trapped.
I don't want to go to work.
Look, we're gonna get out of here, and when we do, I'm gonna start... I'm gonna start growing up.
You have grown up, Nick.
I mean, you own a bar.
You wrote a novel.
I'm talking about really growing up.
There's still so much I want to do, like...
I want to try cilantro.
(Schmidt urinating)
You haven't tried cilantro?
I want to figure out what NASDAQ means.
You've never had salsa?
I want to not shimmy out of my pants.
Feels good being empty.
I'm sorry I kidnapped you, Jess.
I just hated to see you with first-day jitters.
What is wrong with me?
I've been preparing for this job my entire life.
I mean... maybe this'll help.
A bottle of champagne. (laughs)
A toast to the new principal, right?
Should we?
Is that a bottle of Krug Clos d'Camaret-du-sur Mer?
Yeah, it absolutely is a bottle of "Klus Clos de Saminaire."
Little known fact about the late '90s Krug Clos d'Camaret-sur-Mer.
According to my father, they have very strong wire around the cork.
Well, that anecdote's ready to go.
Uncork it, Nick.
Go, go, go.
Look at that.
It's like a key.
Almost exactly like a key.
Uh-huh, yep.
(wire jiggling)
Okay.
(latch clicks)
I did it!
Oh.
I didn't even need to prepare for it.
When Schmidt's back is up against the wall, Schmidt shows up because I have confidence and skill.
Yeah, yeah, finish your epiphany on the way.
We got to go. We got to go.
Let's go to Ass Strat.
Okay, two more hours before... morning announcements.
I think we can still make it if we take zero pee or snack breaks.
Don't worry, I have five toilets.
I'm still too drunk. I can't drive.
All right, drunk check.
Drunk.
Drunk.
All: Crap!
I'm sure glad we exchanged numbers yesterday.
Really worked out, huh?
Yeah.
So, you guys can really get me on The Price Is Right.
Ja.
Drew is a good friend.
Road trip!
Boy ride! Boy ride!
Boy ride!
(laughing): Oh.
Please, can we just go?
The divorce papers are finalized. Good news.
There's no way this could be disappearing ink, right?
Well, I mean, the longest disappearing ink on record is only 42 minutes, so... no, we're good.
Great.
I actually had a good time pranking Rhonda.
No, not you, too. Please.
I mean it. I think we can kind of... get into this as a couple.
We'll prank, have some sex...
Mm... prank people, have some more sex, pet the cat. I'm okay with that life.
I don't understand how any human being could enjoy it.
Well, because we are pranks, don't you see?
Huh?
In the Bible, God created light and dark.
And then separated the heavens from the oceans.
Then created plants, then animals.
And the animals, they thought they had all this cool stuff to themselves, but then God pranked the animals with us.
And it was good.
(whispering): That was so sexy.
Mm-hmm.
That was so sexy.
Winston: I know it was.
Mm-hmm. You like that?
I didn't know you knew all that.
Mm-hmm.
Trick's on me, that's for sure.
What? Why are there adoption papers in here?
Hmm?
What?
There are adoption papers in here.
What?
Let me see this.
Oh, holy hell, Rhonda adopted Aly...
What?
...in Liberia.
In Liberia?
No, no, this doesn't make any sense.
(groaning lightly)
"Dear Aly, please accept these divorce papers as an engagement gift from Mom."
Ew. She said "Mom"?
I mean, I guess that's a good prank.
You're my stepdad?
I'm so confused by what qualifies, I honestly can't weigh in.
I hate my Liberian mom.
Come here.
Okay, Winston.
Uh-oh.
Not now.
That's so crazy. Let's just...
Winston.
Okay.
Not now.
Jess: We made it, and I didn't puke in the car.
(tires screech)
Can we offer you any money for the bus ride home?
What about The Price Is Right?
We lied.
We have no connection to The Price Is Right.
Nobody knows Drew. He-he's a hermit.
You watched me call my mom.
How about $300 to get out of the car?
It's a good deal.
Shut up.
All right, as soon as you step out of this car, Jess, you're gonna be a principal.
It's... holiday. School's closed.
Why are all the kids going in?
Yeah.
If it's... if the school is closed, why are all these little kids going in?
I agree.
No, I'm asking you.
We should just go.
What are you talking about, Jess? It's...
Get out there, you're gonna be late.
Schmidt, can I get a... a minute alone with Jess?
Would you please take the pee bottles with you?
Sure.
A grown man standing around a bunch of ten-year-olds, holding bottles of his own urine.
What could go wrong?
Well, I think I know what's going on with you, Jess.
I mean, you've always been on this path, and now that you're at the end of it, and you've reached the goal, you know, it's a little scary.
Yeah, it's pretty stupid, huh?
No, I don't think it's stupid.
And as a guy who has never had a path like that, I'm personally really excited to see what happens next.
You know what? I'm gonna get out of this car... and I'm gonna go be principal.
Oh. I forgot my blazer.
Way ahead of you, Jess.
Oh. But you were gonna make a pillow out of that.
Ah, it won't fit in my room.
It's not a good style for me.
(chuckles)
It looks great on you.
Thanks, it fits perfectly.
And, Nick, I... I like your room the way it is.
It already has a style. It's you.
Okay, get to class kids.
Only five minutes till... morning announcements.
Go get 'em, Principal Day!
Morning announcements. Morning announcements.
Nailed it.
Morning announcements. Morning...
Valentine's Day!
Schmidt: Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
Oh!
♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪
Go left.
♪ Do your dance ♪
♪ We got a brand-new dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪
♪ Do your dance ♪
(Nick whistling)
Oh, hey, what you doing?
Hey! Oh!
We wasn't doing nothing!
I love the "Cupid Shuffle."
Why'd you stop?
'Cause, uh...
This particular day...
Yeah, it's, like, romantic in nature.
Ugh, that stupid "sad single girl on Valentine's Day" cliché?
Do better.
I have a great day planned.
I'm finally gonna use the celebrity chef dinner that I won at the auction.
And before that, I'm gonna clean out my purse.
Dinner by yourself and cleaning out your purse?
Does that sound sad?
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Oh, kiss it. It's gonna be great.
Hey, is there anything in there from Reagan?
She's in Minnesota, and we're exchanging gifts.
Gonna do the old stand-by, like when we were dating?
A nudie card with a $20 stapled to it?
I did so good.
No, no, no, I'm-I'm putting a real effort this year.
I feel five feet tall.
You're more than five feet right now.
I feel smaller because I'm humbled.
I'm humbled by my actions of tenderness.
Well, the only Valentine in this pile is for yours truly.
Someone very crafty made it.
She sent a Valentine's to herself.
Now, you understand this is sad, this is really sad.
Guys, would a sad person do this?
♪ Down, down, do your dance, do your dance, do your dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪
♪ Do your dance, do your dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance... ♪
Whew! Say what you want, that woman can shuffle. Mm!
♪ ♪
Can't believe that we're not spending Valentine's Day together.
I know. It sucks.
The first year that I haven't planned our bone-iversary.
I think I'd prefer to call it the anniversary of the first night we made love.
Either way, it's our first one as a married couple.
You know, we miss this, the next thing you know, we're making love once a year next to a Thomas Kinkade painting after a hot dog dinner.
It's not your fault, all right?
You've just been working so hard.
I've been k*lling myself trying to impress Kim.
Call the tween footwear people. Here's their number.
Don't trouble yourself. I've got it memorized.
You just dialed 17 numbers.
Loretta, I need you!
Freakin' Loretta!
Kim will take you seriously when she sees you in that fine-ass suit.
Ah, thank you. (sighs)
(chuckles)
How long have we been waiting for this elevator?
What, are we in the lobby of Sterling Cooper?
Hey, hey. What you doing?
Cleaning out your purse? Fun.
Mind if I watch?
Knock yourself out.
(chuckles) Whoo!
What you got there?
Is that a nail clipper?
What you gonna do with that?
Keep, throw away. Keep, throw away. (mumbling)
I'm going with keep, I'm going...
Oh! She's keeping it!
Oh, I get it... you think I'm sad.
Aren't you supposed to be with your girlfriend right now?
Aly's not big on V-Day.
What?
Yeah.
She says it makes her want to eat and successfully pass a nail.
Yeah. I love her so much.
And aren't you gonna propose to her?
Yeah, I am, in due time. But right now, I'm only on phase six of my 21-step proposal plan.
I'm months away.
And in case you were wondering if I'm under budget, I am not... by thousands of dollars.
Winston, no matter what Aly says, all girls love Valentine's Day.
Get your cupcake ass out of here and go make her feel special.
I can't miss this.
Leave me to my froyo cards.
God, I got to start going to the same place, you know.
Or else I'll never get a free one.
(door opens, closes)
Oh.
I'm alone.
I can't even imagine what Reagan got me.
'Cause I know she went, you know, at least as hard as I went, and I got to say, I went hard.
At 11:00, an 11-ounce steak will be sent to her room.
That's large.
At 12:00, a single rose will arrive.
At 1:00, the hotel manager is gonna come, he's gonna tell her there's a problem with her room, he's gonna take her to another room.
When she walks in that room, boom, it's filled with roses.
Damn, son.
It's a slightly worse room, but it's right near an ice machine.
I am proud of you. You're a real Big Boy Cupid.
Big Boy Cupid... I like that.
Say it again.
Big Boy Cupid!
I didn't like it that much that time.
Well, I'm very happy for you on your Valentine's Day.
Doesn't really feel like Valentine's Day to me.
Schmidt didn't get to plan our bone-iversary this year.
If he is too busy to plan the bone-iversary, then you've got to do it.
Okay. Sure, I guess I could step up my game.
Right? Good.
Right, yeah.
Okay, I'll try it, I'll do it.
That is some good advice.
Now my final bit of advice, and don't get sensitive on this, but you got to change that top... it's terrible.
And you got to throw sparkles on.
I think...
Sparkles are in.
I think my top is fine.
Sparkles...
... are in!
There's a line.
You giving me fashion advice...
Sparkles...
... is the line.
... are in!
(laughs)
Look, I know it's not much, but, um, you know, I just thought it would be nice to spend some... koala-ty time together.
Ew.
(Australian accent): G'Day, mate.
Oh, no.
What's a fit Sheila like you doing with this sticky joey?
You were right. I said I didn't want to do anything today, but this is pretty fun.
(British accent): Even though you forgot the Parmesan cheese.
Well, that's not what he would sound like.
I mean, if you're gonna say it, you might as well say it... the way he would...
(both laugh)
I can't even joke be mad at you, because you're so perfect.
Well, you're the most ridiculous person I've ever met.
(laughs)
But, you know, I honestly never get tired of you.
(chuckles)
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but I don't even care, I'm just gonna say it.
Why don't we get married?
(laughs)
Nah...
(grunts)
You said no?
I have a proposal plan, okay?
A plan. You know what, and I would not be in this mess if it wasn't for you convincing me to do Valentine's Day in the first place!
I'm sorry, I'm just...
You know what, I'll just find her at work, okay?
And I'll-I'll tell her yes then.
I'm used to compromising my dreams.
No, Winston, you deserve an amazing engagement.
You're America's sweetheart, and you have to give Aly the proposal she deserves.
And you have to do it today, 'cause she's probably freaking out right now.
It's a 21-step plan.
I can't do it in one night.
You can't, but we can.
Jess, I can't make you do that.
I mean, you had a whole day planned.
I mean, it's a day I maintain was rooted in sadness.
You say I'm sad one more time, and I'm gonna take you to San Francisco, and we're gonna eat a little sourdough, maybe a little crab, and then I'm gonna throw you off the Golden Gate Bridge!
Do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Now, you go tell that son of a bitch cat of yours that he's gonna get a new mommy, 'cause we're gonna propose tonight!
Okay.
Okay, let's cut this 21-stage plan down to the essentials.
Okay.
Great binder, by the way.
You get it at Captain Work?
You know it.
Downtown or Third Street?
Downtown.
Good. Third Street's for idiots.
I'm really loving your vibe right now.
You're really taking control.
Yeah. Uh, okay, Malibu cactus picnic. Did that.
Erotic skywriting. That's a cut.
Mm. See, I'm not sure if you understood...
I know what erotic skywriting is.
It's in the sky.
Special performance by the L.A. Children's Choir?
They're gonna come out all cute and small, singing "Alison."
We're cutting.
Huh?
Okay, we can't get your ring in Atlanta.
It's the most affordable big city in America, so...
Well, I have a local ring guy, so it's Cut-lanta.
(sighs)
Operation Bobcat?
Let's call that "Operation Cut Cat."
No, no, no, no.
Oh, I should have said "Bob Cut."
Next time.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Move your hand. Don't rip that.
When Aly and I were first partners, we got called to break up a drug deal in a bus station bathroom.
When we got there, wasn't nobody in there.
Just a bobcat.
Like, a bobcat running around.
I shrieked. Of course, I was afraid for my life.
But Aly... she, she just laughed. (chuckles)
Laughed and laughed and laughed.
And, you know, it was that moment that made me realize I wanted to make her laugh for the rest of her life.
And so, the plan... was to recreate that moment.
So...
You already have a bobcat costume, don't you?
I'm an oddball romantic.
You bought a bobcat costume before you got a ring?
You really toe the line between sweetness and insanity.
That's the whole thing.
Schmidt: I already e-mailed you the reports, but I know you love hard copies, and I love that about you.
Why?
Why?
All right.
Happy bone-iver...
So, actually, I'm going to, uh, double-check those hard copies, and I'm gonna bring them to you, 'cause I want to make sure that they're ready for your brilliant eyes.
(door closes)
Cece, what the hell are you doing in here?
Surprise!
(pictures clattering)
Cece, I love where your head's at.
Mm-hmm.
And I love where your body is at even more, but I-I can't.
What if I told you that I have the Star of David hidden somewhere on my body, and you have to find it?
Okay.
Okay. All right, let's do it.
But we got to do it really quick.
I'm gonna stay dressed and just poke out like a cuckoo clock.
Not here.
I got a whole thing planned.
(chuckles)
Happy bone-iversary. (chuckles)
Who would have thought the first moment that we ever were intimate with each other, you know?
Honey, we're on the clock here, and it's getting very cold, so why don't we get this car started.
(wind whistling)
(chuckles)
Oh! No, no, no!
Oh! Oh!
What?!
My executive ensemble!
Both: No, no, no!
(grunts)
Thank you for coming, Trevlo.
Hey, got to sell these rings.
Driving towards success.
We blessed.
You're always so positive, Trevlo.
Got to stay positive.
Stay blessed.
Stay blessed.
Yeah, blessings.
(whispers): Blessings raining down on you.
Oh.
I think, we got one, Trevlo!
$12,000? You out of your damn mind, man?
No, no, no.
You got to work with me, Trevlo.
Can't do it, baby.
Come on, Jess, you told me this dude was your friend.
Friend is a stretch. I rear-ended him in a drive-thru, and he gave me his card.
Blessings.
What?!
What?!
What the hell you do to my fade, Jess?!
I said a soft blend! Soft!
I think it looks great, baby. It's all your perception.
I look like if LeBron James turned around.
Calm down.
Look, I'm trying to stay calm, Jess, but I'm trying to fit a 21-step plan into three hours.
Stay blessed.
I swear I'm gonna shove one of those blessings right up...
Trevlo! I thought that was you!
Wow, look at you. Looking trim.
Been counting my steps, baby.
You know Trevlo, too?
Yeah, I was in the car when Jess h*t him.
Stay blessed.
Stay blessed.
Stay blessed.
Everybody stay blessed.
Stay blessed.
Anyway, Schmidt's having a Valentine's Day emergency, and he called on Big Boy Cupid for help.
Cece's been calling me Big Boy Cupid because I'm super romantic now.
What can I say? I'm in love.
Trevlo: Nick, you in love?
Tell me about her.
Is she positive?
She is not positive, but I can't wait to see what she got me for Valentine's Day.
You know what?
Can't do it. The proposal is off.
What?!
I feel like I'm being a bad friend by putting you in this spot.
What spot?
Jess, I saw your face when Nick said he was in love.
Didn't have a face.
Yes, you're sad.
I'm not sad.
Please, everyone, stop telling me I'm sad!
A proposal is the last thing that you should be doing.
I'm calling it.
Come on!
We don't have a ring, we're rushing through all the steps.
It's better this way.
I'll come up with a plan B, I'll make it up to her for Valentine's Day.
You got to take care of yourself.
I feel very, very happy.
Stay home, relax.
Have your meal with your private chef, and more than anything... stay blessed.
Don't tell me to stay blessed.
You stay blessed!
♪ Stay blessed! ♪
You know, it's still our bone-iversary.
I'm too stressed.
Sex right now would be like picking a lock with a cold, wet French fry.
Nick. Nick!
What?
(whistles, caws)
Nick! Finally.
Nick!
I couldn't see you. This thing was blocking me.
Loretta's probably running the company by now.
Get over here!
Sorry I'm late.
There was a TV crew by the Staples Center, so I had to jump around behind the guy to get on TV, but the good news, I got on TV, so I think I'm gonna be on the news.
Great.
What do you got?
Here, I got this for you, man. You got some pants.
Got a suit jacket.
You brought that suit?!
It's a 62 short.
I wore that to college graduation.
It was in your closet!
As motivation!
Here you go, Cece. It's a beautiful dress.
My wedding dress?!
Ah, it's your wedding dress? I knew it looked familiar.
'Cause you were at the wedding!
You're a buffoon idiot.
Oh, my God, it's Kim. It's Kim. It's Kim. Shh.
Shh, shh.
(crying)
This is the start of a very long cry.
As a bartender, you really get to know the human cry.
(continues crying)
(sighs) So what else is going on with you guys?
(food sizzling)
So is it just you?
Yup.
You know I'm quite famous, and you didn't want anybody else to experience my food?
No.
Just me. Just my day.
Are you sad 'cause you're on your own, on Valentine's night?
Ugh!
Don't you start with me, Gordon Ramsay!
I'm having just a great time.
Liar!
Sorry. Bad habit.
Just bring me the scallops, please.
Impatient.
Mmm. Delicious.
(sighs)
Scallops... aren't...
(dish shatters)
... for liars.
Why are you sad?
I'm not sad.
Then what are you?
I'm mad!
There it is.
I'm mad that Nick just decided to be a great boyfriend.
Where does all this effort come from?
Reagan gets Mr. Cupid, and I got, like, some nudie card.
This bread is incredible.
You taste the crust?
It's really good.
And you know what else pisses me off?
The fact that everyone thinks I'm sad.
I mean, Winston canceled his engagement 'cause of it.
Then bloody do something about it!
Brilliant! Uh, just a reminder: I'm not required to clean up.
Winston can't throw away his dreams because of me!
Then don't let him.
Hey, Jess, what's up?
Winston, I'm not sad. I'm mad!
Bloody brilliant.
Okay. Cool.
Thanks for the call.
I'm not letting you throw away your dreams, okay?
You're proposing in that bus station bathroom, and I am going to help you.
I'll meet you there in one hour, and I'm bringing the bobcat suit.
Bobcat suit?
Thank God, because my plan B was weak!
(grunts)
(sighs)
(grunts)
(whoops)
(chuckles): I'm the man.
Cece: Okay, she's not looking. Come on, let's go.
We can go now, we can go.
No, don't move.
If we move, we... I'm-I'm fired.
Nick: She's not gonna get off this roof.
I know how to handle this.
Are you out of your mind?
You're just gonna materialize out of thin air on a rooftop?
Easy. I work here. I'm a window washer, and I finally got to the top floor.
You don't like that one? How about this one?
I'm a traffic guy, and I fell out of the news chopper.
What are you talking about?
All these work perfectly.
I'll just pick my favorite on the way over.
Sit down, you nincompoop.
This is completely my fault.
I just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.
And I just wanted to find some way to show you... how much I love you.
Instead, all I did was mess up your job.
(sighs)
Cece.
I'm sorry.
You mean more to me... than any job ever will.
Screw it.
Screw what? What?
(sighs)
(sniffles)
I love Cece!
Oh, well, then I love Schmidt!
I love him.
Love you.
Love you.
Well, this is a productive use of time.
What the hell is going on, Schmidt?
And what is that guy doing?
I'm a chimney sweep.
All these are clogged.
A chim...?
Clogged, clogged, clogged.
Are you crying? That's the question. Are you crying?
I just met my birth mother.
I don't have to explain myself to a chimney sweep.
Schmidt, why are you dressed like a Little Rascal?
The truth is it's... it's our bone-iversary.
(groans)
Kim, this job means so much to me, but... she means a lot more.
So... if this costs me the promotion, then...
I can live with that.
You know, this is the first conversation we've ever had where you weren't lying to me.
It's nice.
I'm not flaming with rage.
And by the way, I've noticed you're working your ass off.
Now get back to work.
Cece, your décolletage looks beautiful.
Thank you.
Okay. Yeah.
It cleans up pretty nice.
And this ring is perfect.
How did you get Trevlo to come down on the price?
I don't think it's a legitimate business, and that's the real answer.
Anyway, I got it done.
(chuckles)
Okay. I called the station, they're sending Aly down on a public disturbance call.
Nice.
I'm nervous, but, you know, I'm really glad we are doing this, you know.
If I didn't propose in a public bathroom while wearing a bobcat costume, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.
(indistinct police radio chatter)
Oh, here she comes.
Uh, put your head on.
Okay.
Oh, nice touch.
Police! You have five seconds to pull your pants up.
Your bus is leaving.
Come on, man. I'm having a really bad day.
(roars)
(screams)
(Winston groans)
Ah, that's a concussion.
Just a little bump, right?
What is going on?
Happy Valentine's Day.
What?
Jess, why did you decorate a bathroom?
Oh, boy.
Why is Winston dressed like a tiger?
He's dressed as a bobcat, but...
I got something I want to say.
When my head h*t the wall, it knocked my eyes out of focus.
So I'm gonna need you to read it for me.
Oh, my God. Okay. Um...
I'm still a little woozy.
Jess: Aly, um, look at Winston, but listen to me.
Um, fellas!

Look at this place!
You've got a wet bar, you've got a thermostat.

All right, Loretta, get out of here.

Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Hey. You got to come out here.
Winston's letting everyone try on the bobcat costume.
Oh. I'll be, I'll be right out.
Uh, my Valentine's Day gift from Reagan finally came.
That's nice.
Yeah. She got me a necklace.
(chuckles) Did you want a necklace?
No. Not really.
I don't know if I'm a necklace guy.
Well, some guys call it a chain.
A chain?
Yeah.
I call a chain the thing you put on tires in the snow.
Oh.
I got to say, I don't know what I expected from her, but it's definitely not this.
I'm sorry, Nick. If it makes you feel any better, I spent the day cleaning blood off of a wall in a bus station bathroom.
(chuckles)
Well, Happy Valentine's Day, Jess.
Happy Valentine's Day, Miller.
To the happy couple.
All: Cheers.
Oh.
Come on.
Oh, he's still concussed.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
To a beautiful engagement you probably won't remember.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cece: You haven't tasted a drop.
Winston: It won't go in.
Nick: Then stop doing it!
Well, this is the last of Robby's stuff.
How you doing with the breakup?
Really well, since we're related, and all the laws of nature say we should not be together.
If you guys need me today, I'll be in my room rearranging my furniture so it no longer resembles a place where I made out with my cousin.
(all groaning)
Third cousin.
Still.
Ugh, barely better.
Ew.
Don't normalize it, Jess.
Ugh.
You're right, you're right.
Ugh.
Hey, Nick.
Are you wearing your running bottoms and your hoodie?
Nick, are you going running?
Have fun.
Oh, my God. What is wrong with Nick, Reagan?
Yeah, what happened? Are you guys okay?
Nick is going for a run. (chuckles)
If anything, we should be asking what is right with Nick.
He only goes running if he's upset.
And he's wearing his sad hoodie.
And by the looks of it, it's been washed, which is bone-chilling.
He's fine. Everything's okay.
I just passed Nick on the street running, on purpose!
Oh, my God!
Maybe I was wrong.
Nick! Are you okay?!
I see you!
And I love you!
In my defense, no one here emotes in a normal way.
That's fair.
Nick!

How's the boba?
It's fine.
Why are you making so much eye contact with us?
Oh, you're gonna ask us for something, aren't you?
The boba is a metaphor.
Aly is the tapioca pearl to my milky matcha, each made better by the unlikely presence of the other.
I think you know what I'm saying...
We have absolutely no idea.
I haven't known what you've been saying for three and a half years.
I'm asking Aly to marry me.
What?!
Whoa!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my gosh!
Winston. My man!
(chuckles) Yeah.
Yes. (chuckles)
And I'm gonna need your help with the process.
Now, keep this between us.I  am only telling you two.
Yeah, we won't say a word. Yeah.
Whatever you need.
Meet me at the bar in one hour, okay?
Look fresh.
We'll discuss details. I'm gonna need you for the entire day.
We're with you.
Yes.
Little Winnie is growing up.
First he's a husband and then maybe one day he could be a father...
One day? (chuckles)
I am a father.
It's a cat, Winston.
He's my blood.
I am never gonna figure him out.
I feel like I found a forest baby, and I don't know when it's hungry or in pain or afraid of the kitchen light.
I know. (chuckles)
Nick is just an enigma wrapped up in a bunch of Chicago Bears crap.
You need the help of a seasoned vet.
(knocking at door)
Come in!
Hey, Nick.
Hey.
You feeling upset about something?
No. I'm just eating edamame.
Give me the cup. (spits)
They taste so bad.
That's what I thought.
I submitted The Pepperwood Chronicles to a publishing company, and I got the rejection letter today.
My career is over.
No, it's not.
Nick, someday you'll be talking to a reanimated Oprah about that book.
Have you talked to Reagan about this?
I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.
No, I am too embarrassed.
Nick, she's your girlfriend. You have to let her in.
Don't just keep her in the perfect front room.
Okay.
Let her in the back, with the weird rooms and the-the d*ad bulbs and the wet walls.
All right, but I'm not letting her go anywhere near my crawl space.
I don't think you should let anyone near your crawl space.
Well, some people have to go to the crawl space to clean out the boxes.
Who cleans out the boxes?
Significant other.
What are you talking about?
Hey. I have the scoop.
Nick's book got rejected, and he's really embarrassed.
So now the baton...
♪ has been passed... ♪
... to you.
You own an actual baton?
It was Robby's.
He was really into competitive male twirling.
I have so many questions...
No.
Winston: First, thank you for coming to this very special event.
Might I just add that everyone looks fresh.
Now, when Aly gets here, I am going to suggest an activity for the four of us to do.
Then I'll gracefully back out, leaving the two of you to distract her, as I prepare for... the show.
(giggling)
Ooh, I got a scream and nowhere to put it.
Ooh, this is exciting.
Now, at an undisclosed time, I will place a call to Aly, informing her that my car has broken down in Malibu, where I'll be waiting with a beautiful and glorious picnic right next to her favorite plant...  the common cactus.
Here comes that scream. Oh, my God, there she is.
Oh, I'm screaming already. Aly!
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
(giggling)
(chuckles)
Strange energy, guys.
(giggling continues)
We all had bubbly water. It made us giggle.
What's up? What's up? What's up?
Hi. Hello.
What's up?
Hi. Hello.
Hello.
Anyway, uh, Schmidt and Cece asked us to help paint their house.
Paint our house?
Paint the house.
Remember? That's the activity for all of us to do.
You know, 'cause you wanted... you wanted...
Paint the house. Paint the house. Yes, we... did.
Even though the majority of our house is already painted.
We wanted our best friends to finish it.
Not professionals.
Like, uh... like our new home was some tree house in a Little League baseball movie.
I mean, I-I've never done it before, but...
Sounds like a yes to me.
Aw, snap, just remembered, I can't make it.
Uh, uh, boo.
Uh... (exhales)
Yeah.
Boy, that's a bummer.
Shock. So fast.
sh**t.
Ugh.
But, you know, boo.
What up, boy in the hood?
I thought you were gonna talk to Reagan.
I tried, but she's been on her phone all day like a grandpa who missed a package.
Like... "Hel..."
I'm not even gonna do it.
Yes. Thank you so much. We will be there. Thanks.
Nick, I know that dumb publisher rejected your book.
And, guess what, that publisher can go to hell.
After you b*at them to death with this baton that I weirdly still have.
Because you don't need a publisher.
You need a girlfriend who found a bookstore... to sell Pepperwood.
Seriously?
That's amazing. That's amazing!
I called all over and I finally found one.
Reagan saved the day!
You're amazing.
That's right.
All we need is, uh, 30 copies of the book.
Oh, well, we can make them.
I mean, it'll be hard, but we could do it.
We could do it. We'll make 'em ourselves.
Fantastic. Uh, we just need 'em by tonight for his big reading.
Excuse me, did you say "big..."
"a big reading tonight"?
Yeah.
Well, that sounds... public.
Well, I mean, he's got to do a reading to sell the book.
Is that bad?
Is that bad?
No, it's good. I get...
I get to do a reading tonight in front of people.
Yeah.
I get to read in front of a bunch of people who are gonna judge me.
This is not bad. This is good. This is... (exhales)
Jess: See, this is another thing that Nick does when he's upset.
At least he's not running.
(clattering)
So you want me to read in front of people.
You want me to read in front of living people...
(voice squeaking): who are there to hear me read.
And how will I... how will I even know what to read?
You're gonna read your book.
I'll read my book. Fine.
This is good. I'm fine.
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
Oh, I feel like my heart is pumping out scalding hot toilet water.
See, a vivid description like that is gonna make the audience go wild.
Ah, the audience! I just forgot the audience, and now I remember the audience.
I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't do it.
All right, here it is...
The Pepperwood Chronicles.
I made a prototype.
Jess, that looks fantastic!
That looks really good.
How did you do that?
Oh, that's between me and my craft wagon.
I wrote you.
Hey, um, how's he doing?
Not very good.
Hmm.
And if I'm being honest with you, I'm starting to freak out now.
This is me freaking out.
Do I sometimes wonder if you're a robot?
Yeah.
I've made you!
You're of me.
Jess: When Nick gets like this, he needs to be occupied.
Luckily, we have tons of books to make.
It's got my name in it.
Jess (sing-songy): Book time!
Gather around, my little Guttenbergs!
Here we go.
Hey, Jess, can I borrow your cactus gloves?
Ooh!
Making books, huh?
♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪
♪ I can fly twice as high ♪
♪ Take a look ♪
♪ It's in a book. ♪
Ah, you know the rest.
Just, we put... we put 'em there.
Backing away from an active craft project.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No. Um, Reagan's a little insecure about being there for Nick.
So I want her to have this.
Oh.
Wow. I'm proud of you.
Yeah.
Thanks.
(both laugh)
This is where you give me the cactus gloves.
This is really soothing.
You're a natural.
(whispering): She's terrible.
She's ruining our bedroom.
It's like she's begrudgingly covering up graffiti.
Oh, there's a couple rough patches, but... that's what posters are for.
Just calm down, okay? We can fix it later, but we have to keep her in here for Winston.
Hey. Since we're doing this, I got to say, do not like the color of your bathroom.
You know what?
Now that I think about it, me either.
(quietly): What?!
Let's do that next.
Great.
It's special order robin's egg.
It's just paint!
It's not just paint.
Hey, guys... as much as I love a good whisper fight, I should go.
Cece: Oh, no! No, no, no.
You, uh, can not leave.
Why not?
Because we can't be alone together.
Because...?
Because... because... we're having marital problems.
That's... secret, which is part of our marital problem.
She's got a big mouth, but a great can.
Which is also part of our marital problems.
I objectify her.
Aly: See. I knew something was up.
Everyone was like, "They're so perfect!"
And I was like, "No. Something in that relationship is very, very broken."
Hey, Nick. Where's Reagan?
Getting more glue. We ran out.
How many did you get done?
One... and I think we did it wrong.
It doesn't look right to me.
Your reading's in three hours! It...
Let's make some books! I think I have some really good glue in my non-mobile craft cart.
You're gonna help me?
Yeah!
Let's do it.
(both laugh)
God, this glue works great!
Oh, it smells great, too!
It really does.
(both sniffing)
(sniffing)
Oh, I love the smell of new books!
(sniffing)
(laughing): Yeah, me, too.
Mmm! New, new books.
New, new books!
Oh! Can I tell you something?I  feel great right now.
I feel very good. I feel very confident.
I am ready for that read.
I think you're gonna crush it.
I think I'll read the whole book in about two minutes.
Yeah. Just get in there. You'll...
(sputtering gibberish)
What?
What?
What?
What?
(sputtering gibberish)
And people are gonna go nuts.
(sputtering gibberish)
They're gonna be like, "Yes, yes, we love this book."
And they're gonna just buy every copy, and then you're gonna have to, like, print more.
That's what's gonna happen.
Does your hair always look like that?
Yeah.
Do you have brown hair?
Definitely.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a secret.

(cackling)
Check this out. I'm gonna birth this book.

Here you go. It's a baby book.
Oh!

Congratulations!
It's a paperback!
Hey, guys.
Reagan!
Reagan!
Reagan.
Reagan...!
(Reagan sighs, Jess and Nick laugh)
Sorry that took so long.
I got stuck behind this, uh, lady at the craft store that was buying 700 individually-priced buttons.
Mm.
Oh, they said to say hi to you.
Hi.
And I got you a new shirt, Nick.
Oh, isn't that nice.
Phew! What the hell is that smell, you guys?
We made a library!
Mm.
Is this the glue?
It comes from my private collection.
Mm-hmm.
It's very strong.
You guys are so high.
How dare you?
How dare you?
I'm not high at all.
You're high.
Whoa!
(clattering)
You guys, this says to use this in an open field.
It specifically says that a backyard is too small.
You're a backyard.
Very good.
(inhaling loudly)
I think I should cancel this reading.
No way!
I am in. I feel great for the reading.
Let me just buckle up my shirt.
Well, the problem with this author shirt is that it's made of honey.
It's not...
This shirt is too sticky.
It's because there's glue on your...
'Cause it's made of honey, so...
I'm canceling.
You cannot do a reading in this condition.
No! Don't cancel the reading!
You worked so hard to get it!
I got a backpack full of Pepperwoods, and I'm ready.
Nick: Oh!
Jess: Aah!
Jess, I'm coming!
Reagan, call g*n.
(groaning)
(groaning)
Are you pulling?
I can't feel you pulling.
Let me get your legs!
Please don't drag her.
(grunting)
(whispering): Winston, where are you?
We are freaking out in increasingly weird ways.
I'm at a costume shop, getting ready for the big proposal.
A costume shop?
All in good time.
Now, listen, when I text you, I need you to bring Aly to Malibu, okay?
I don't want the two of us to drive back separately.
Plus, I want to make out at red lights.
Okay, Winston. Just how much longer?
This is very important to me.
If you mess this up, you ruin my life, okay?
No, Winston. Uh, uh...
Okay, bye!
No. No, no, no. Uh...
Ooh!
So many marital problems we have.
My baby's got a real sweet tooth.
Just the other day, she ate an entire sleeve of pecan sandies... and punched the top right off of a parking meter.
(Cece clears her throat)
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
She yells at me constantly and... there's one time where she tipped over a table.
He gambled away another paycheck.
Oh, no!
It's the ponies. I'm addicted.
Right, right, right.
Cece: It's true.
All the money that he wins on gambling, he puts up his nose.
Oh.
It's cocaine now, as well.
Love me the ca-caine.
Ah, yeah.
Feel invisible when I do it.
This feels like some sort of weird foreplay.
I'm out of here.
Wait. No. Aly, please. Um...
Don't leave me with this rage monster.
Oh, yeah. You... I mean, you want to see a rage monster?
You want me to show her the rage monster?
Well, here you go.
No!
Just...
Gosh darn.
... tipping tables!
All right, that's...
Wait. Aly, Aly.
Uh, but I just...
Please don't leave.
She belongs in a mental hospital!
What?!
I know what's happening.
You guys are trying to distract me from some weird thing Winston's planning.
Uh, no. Aly, no.
Possibly a prank?
Might be a zotz, a goof.
If it's prank, please tell him I wore bad underwear today. Please.
Frank Sinatra strikes again.
It's a prank, it's a prank.
That's exactly what it is.
It's a prank. Great.
Oh. Winston.
Stranded in Malibu.
All right, let's get this over with.
Winston.
Hmm. Yep.
(Nick sighs)
The good news is I'm feeling sober.
The bad news is maybe I'm too sober.
Yeah. I'm sobered up, too.
Great.
Why are my eyes so good?
I can read everything from here.
What does that mean?
Oh, my God. A secret world.
Okay. I don't think she's sober at all.
(gasps)
Okay. Hi.
Thank you for supporting your local bookstore.
Quick reminder: we're dying. Please buy things.
I was feeling very confident before, but I'm losing some of it, so I think might just take one more quick pull.
No, no. No, no, no.
Just one more quick pull.
Just one more quick.
Oh, my goodness.
Is this gonna be a problem?
Get it together.
And now, please welcome Nick Miller, author of The Pepperwood Chronicles.
(whispering): No, no.
(applause)
Go ahead...
Nick.
Go ahead. They called...
What a wonderful day.
Quick reminder: we are dying.
I wrote this, every word.
All of that.
My hard work, not yours.
It's not a competition.
If everybody could stop looking at me, that'd be really great.
If you guys wouldn't mind just closing your eyes, as if you were at some sort of a show where you were asked to close your eyes.
What?
Thank you.
Do you mind looking down, sir?
(whispering): Nick.
All of these are for sale.
What's that? Yeah... coming.
Patron: Is that it?
Um...
Nick: Don't worry about me, I live here now.
All right, what are we gonna do? What's the plan?
Well, it helps if you feed him something first.
Do you have any meat? Or nuts?
Why would I have come to the bookstore with meat and nuts in my purse?
Okay. Caramels.
I don't have that.
All right. Just tell him you believe in him, and that he can do this.
Yeah. I'm not good at this.
Obviously. So... what would you say, Jess, if you were me?
I would say...
(sighs)
Nick, you're... one of the most amazing people I've ever met.
Everyone here is lucky to hear your book, because it's a part of you.
And if you fail, it doesn't change how special you are.
And no matter what happens here, I'll always love you.
Or something like that.
That made me tear up a little bit.
I'm gonna use that.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
What are you doing?
I'm just hanging out in here. I'm just taking a break.
Just, just having a moment... yeah.
Hey. No. You are... you are amazing.
And you, you're, you're, uh, special boy.
Like, uh, um... you know, you... like, uh, you're, you are... very special, you know what I'm saying.
Uh, and let me start over.
(clears throat) Nick.
I believe in you.
Hey, this thing's awesome.
Did that guy write this?
Yeah. He sure did.
There's a sadness about him.
I know what you mean.
Jess: Oh, there's movement.
(sighs)
Sorry about that. Uh, that was some weird stuff.
"The sun baked down on Pepperwood's back as he moved over to the St. Charles streetcar. The driver handed him a brown paper sack. Without opening it, Pepperwood knew what was inside: blood-soaked beignets."
He is so dreamy.
Oh, your life's gonna be so hard.
Okay, Bishop, what is happening?
Do you really need a spare?
Oh, I got a spare.
A spare cactus.
Oh, my God.
I planted it in this spot that is perfect.
You see, the cactus is common, but the company is not.
Hello, beautiful.
It's perfect.
Come on.
We should probably just give them their privacy.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
Holy hell. He's doing it.

It's a shoelace. False alarm.
Okay, now here it is.
Here it is. It's happening.
That is a ring.
I don't think that's a ring.
Is he giving her a gummy vitamin?
(Cece gasps) Okay, this is it, this is it.
And the other shoe?
That's why I double knot his laces.
You know what? Let's stop asking questions. Who knows?
It's... their date. It's their date.
What is this?
Hey. You guys can take off now.
Of course. You want to be alone for when you pop the question.
Got it.
Wait. What?
We're so excited for the both of you.
Oh. Oh, you thought I was gonna propose today?
No. Yo, that's hilarious.
What do you mean it's not today?
No. This is just phase one... of 20.
What?
What?
Yeah.
We went through all of this for a non-proposal cactus picnic?
Damn it, Winston.
My girl deserves the grandest proposal ever, okay?
And that cannot be rushed.
That is actually sweet.
That's not sweet.
I te... Here's a phase for you: When I throw you off the cliff into the ocean.
Okay.
Hey, look, don't worry.
For the next 20 weeks, I've only got you helping out with odd-numbered phases, okay?
And there will be sub-phases, obviously.
I ain't doing no sub-phases.
Think of them as annoyingly elaborate... smaller phases.
He's really pushing his limits right now.
Thank you so much for your help. One phase down.
Boop.
Don't boop him.
Just one. I wish we sold just one.
Hey. You did great.
Jess: Nick. I'd like to introduce you to your number one fan.
Hey. I really enjoyed what you read, and hearing it and how the characters were good, and how your face looks, and I want to hold it...
All right. Keep it cool, keep it cool.
I think Mariah would like to buy a copy of the book.
You want to buy one?
Yes.
How much ya got?
A dollar.
Well, the purchase price is $12.95, so...
I'm comfortable with the dollar.
Okay, fine. A dollar's fine.
Good deal.
The signature's free with the dollar.
There you go.
Thank you.
Don't read it all in one place.
You okay, Nick?
Yeah.
Just concerned about...
The shed scene.
... the shed scene.
But I don't remember the shed scene.
You don't remember the shed scene?
I don't remember it.
It's an incredibly graphic sexual scene.
That's not good.
Disgustingly sexual.
Who cares?
My first sale.
Reagan: Congratulations.
Nick: I did it.
Jess: Yeah, Nick!
Nick: Yeah, me!
Okay, we got our maps.
Yeah.
Got our canteens.
Yeah.
Got our trail mix, homemade of course.
Got my book of local fauna.
Got my book of local flora.
So we can identify...
Both: ♪ Every living thing. ♪
Schmidt: Look at them.
I feel like Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity, living in a house filled with clones.
It is the second time this week you've compared yourself to Andie MacDowell. It's weird.
I'll go grab... Our boots because we should... Break them in.
Exactly.
Nah, that's weird.
Robby and I are hiking Behar Pass tomorrow.
Turns out, we both love hiking.
It's amazing. We have a lot in common.
Aly and I are finally gonna have the same city in common.
Right on, man.
(Winston laughs)
Lefty's coming home. (laughs)
Lefty?
Lefty?
Yeah, she's left-footed.
I'm throwing Aly a surprise welcome-home dinner.
I invited her whole family here, you know.
Uh, I wanted her to see all the people she loves, which becomes love for me, you know, and the next thing you know, I'm getting one of those "best boyfriend ever" mugs, which you can buy, I just don't want to do all that.
I want to... I want to earn it.
You're inviting them over here?
Yeah.
Winston, this place is a hellhole.
Look at this. All the dishes are broken.
I'm eating pasta out of some thing that Jess and Robby made in a clay class.
Both: Pottery workshop.
What the hell is this compartment for?
I have a better idea.
Why don't you throw your thing at our place?
Ever since our wedding china came in, we've been dying to host a dinner party.
Is your house even done yet?
All the party zones are in working order: living room, dining room.
The master bedroom has sort of turned into a place where the workers throw all their trash.
I think even one of them went to the toilet in there.
But...
We'll just lock that door.
Yes.
Let's do it.
Reagan's out of town. You know what that means.
No.
What does that mean?
Honestly, I don't know, but please let me come to the party.
(gasps) Time to h*t the sack.
It's 6:30. Babies are still awake.
Both: Not this baby.
(Jess and Robby laugh)
I feel like I've lived through this before.
I'm like Andie MacDowell in Groundhog Day.
Stop! Just please stop.
Nick: Are you kidding me?
♪ ♪
Both (to the tune of "ice ice baby"): ♪ Hike, hike, baby. ♪
(imitating bass line)
Ooh, it's a fork.
Well, the map says to go left, but that little musket trail seems plumb adorable.
And it has a waterfall, so I say, uh.... waterfall.
(both chuckle)
I mean, let's just do it. Let's go nuts.
See, this is why we're so great together.
We agree on everything.
I agree.
(chuckles)
Hey, Robert Frost, looks like we're gonna take the road...
Jess traveled.
(both laugh)
All right, just, uh... that's not the way it goes.
Hold on.
Be easier if it wasn't so windy.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Made a list of rules for our guests.
Obviously, no one's wearing shoes inside the house, but what if we put a foot-washing station in the driveway?
Babe, I was thinking maybe we have no rules.
Well, because growing up, all the cool houses didn't have rules, remember?
I was never invited to any of the cool houses.
My only friend in high school was my piano teacher, and then he got that boyfriend with the Trans Am, and I never saw him again.
I really wish I could travel back in time and give young you a hug.
Yeah, well young me would've greeted that hug with an immediate collapse in orgasm.
Oh.
But you know what, maybe you're right.
If we want to be the place where friends gather... maybe we got to chill.
Yeah, because we... we want to be the hub.
You know?
Ooh, we'd make such a good hub.
Yes, we would.
Make such a good... we'd make such a good hub.
Are you having an orgasm right now?
Are you kidding me?
Hey.
Hey.
Winston Bishop, nice to meet you.
What are we doing right now?
I'm practicing introducing myself to Aly's parents.
Oh, I got you.
You're a little nervous. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.
You know, I want to make a good first impression.
Oh, that makes sense.
How's my shake?
Nope. No, no, no, no, no.
Do not go in with two hands.
Also, why are your hands so wet?
Damn, for me that's dry.
They're dripping.
How's this for Aly's mom?
I'm Aly's mom?
Okay.
Mm-mm.
(smooches) Not today, honey.
Yeah, all wrong.
We bring it in for the real thing.
All wrong.
All wrong.
Okay.
That was very aggressive.
You inv*de my space. I didn't feel safe.
Just be more normal about it. Like this.
Hey, how are you? I'm Winston. Nice to meet you.
Oh, like...
Hey, how are you? I'm Winston.
Zip, a pleasure, uh, to do it.
See, all of that, cut that out.
Okay.
Hi, how are you? I'm Aly's mother.
(smooches)
You do... you do well. (chuckles)
You do well to-to be friends with me.
Hmm?
Winston, shake it out.
(laughs) I'm nervous, dude.
I know you are.
Look, they're gonna love you.
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna mill about.
I'm gonna talk you up. I'm gonna tell your stories.
Yes. Use one of my good ones, the ones that make me look awesome.
(chuckles) Like the time I fell asleep in the bathtub.
But all that one is is that you fell asleep in a bathtub.
The end. End of story.
That's amazing.
I think we can come up with better ones, don't you?
No, that's a home run for sure, because I woke up wet.
Now I see.
And also, it's all about how you tell it.
Right.
I trust you. You're the writer.
I am, and that was the gift I was given.
Put her there.
You got it.
What is going on with these hands?
What?
A second ago, they were dripping wet, and now they are piping hot.
("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)
Leslie!
Winston!
I h*t your car when I parked. Sorry.
Yeah, I... I didn't drive here.
Oh, well, that's a relief.
Anyway, uh, your sister is on her way. Where are your parents?
Oh, my dad doesn't take highways for political reasons.
But everyone else is here.
Cool.
Come on in. (laughs)
Hey.
Hi there.
Hey there.
Hey.
Thank you.
Wow.
How big is your family? (chuckles)
Oh, my gosh. Hey.
How many cars did you guys take?
Hey, make yourselves at home. Everybody come on in.
Did you guys rent a bus?
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Hey. Hey now.
Schmidt: Winston, Winston.
Winston. A-a word, please.
Huh? Yeah, coming.
Hey.
Hey, man, you look familiar.
Did I pull you over last week?
Why so many?
Cece (quietly): There are 30 people out there.
(bl*ws nose)
Schmidt: We do not have enough china!
Or forks or prawns.
You can't ask somebody to split a prawn.
Babe, I know, all right? But you just need to relax.
We will be fine.
(glass breaks)
We can adjust.
Man: Sorry.
Just remember, we're chill.
No, you're right. We are totally chill.
We'll just break out the backup china!
I'll just come in tomorrow morning with a power washer, and hose this whole frickin' place down.
("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)
There's Lefty.
By the way, there is no backup china!
I know, I know, all right.
(crowd quiets)
Keep them closed.
Aly: All right, last time you did this, you revealed Furguson in a tuxedo.
(laughs) This is even better.
Say hello to... your entire family!
All: Surprise!
(whispers): What the hell is this?
(quietly): So, do the cute, surprised look you do.
Nah, that's not it. That's not the one.
Remember? When you...
Oh.
You're pissed.
We're lost.
Why did you let me chase a waterfall?
You know what TLC says.
I'm sorry. Just...
I'm really hungry.
Here.
You can have some of my trail mix.
That's just a bag of raisins.
Well, that's because I only like to eat the peanuts and the chocolate.
Well, I only like the chocolate and the peanuts, too!
Why do we even add raisins?!
I don't know!
All right, look, you know what, we're lost and... it's gonna get dark soon, so let's... just head back.
Fine. Did you pack a flashlight?
Robby, did you pack a flashlight?
No.
Then there's your answer.
You know what, it's fine, okay?
We know that we have to go downhill, so just follow me.
I'll lead, okay?
Ah! God! Oh!
Oh! Robby!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
I lost my glasses.
Are you okay?
Oh.
Please tell me those were crunchy leaves.
Let me see.
Oh, I think that's them.
Hold on. Oh! Jess!
Ah!
Ah! Ow, my ankle!
My beautiful dancer's ankle!
Hey. What's the matter?
You know, I got all your family together in one room.
You know, you're being greeted by all the people that you love.
I know.
Well, except for your parents, but they will be here soon, barring any surface street traffic.
That is so sweet, Winston.
And I do love my family, but they're crazy.
And, honestly, they make me a little crazy.
Every family is crazy.
Every time we get together, it's a disaster.
Like a giant hot air balloon catching on f*re.
Here's the difference: you got backup now.
Have I ever let you down as a partner?
Except for that mixed doubles tournament.
Got it!
We don't got to talk about that. We ain't got to go back there.
My point is this: we're a team.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Maybe this time will be different.
Right?
Yeah.
But you really need to know the lay of the land.
Okay, let me take notes.
So, my sister is... my sister.
Mm-hmm.
Uncle Bill is a real weather nerd.
Super annoying.
Right, right, right.
Aunt Karen keeps a free-floating piece of floss in her purse.
She will use it tonight.
It's revolting.
Okay.
Do me a favor. Hold on.
Repeat everything you just said.
My thumbprint won't let me in.
Okay, uh, my sister is... you met her...
Ah, wait, yeah, no, no, still not in.
Let me get... wipe my hand off right there.
Now we're cooking with gas. (chuckles)
My sister... okay.
No, we ain't.
Winston, he's a great guy.
Mm-hmm.
He and I go way back.
Tons of stories, tons of... tons of stories.
Really? All right.
Right now?
Yeah.
One time he was taking a bath and he fell asleep.
(wheezing laugh)
You believe this guy? What a nut.
Life of the party, this guy.
He fell asleep in a bath? That's the story?
That's the story? No.
That's the start of the story.
We are out of appetizers.
They stripped this tray of shrimp like piranhas.
They didn't even leave tails.
I think someone took a shower in the bathroom.
We don't have towels or soap.
I don't know how they did it.
We need to re-examine this whole no rules thing.
It's a freaking circus in here.
What are we gonna feed these people in the meantime?
In about ten minutes, they're gonna start eating the drywall.
I think there was a...
(plate clanks loudly)
(chuckles) Thank you.
Thank you.
I think there was a bag of rice in the house when we bought it.
I thought that was barley.
It was really dirty.
Okay, fine, whatever. Boil it up!
Robby: Okay, well, it's really dark and uneven, but at least we found the trail.
Yeah, I mean, it's like a night hike. (chuckles)
Maybe we'll see a colony of bats. (chuckles)
It's kind of like a waterfall.
But with monsters, in the sky.
(thunder cracks)
Oh! Oh, man.
Okay, uh, Jess, it's raining.
Jess: Let's take shelter in that cave!
What if it's more of a nest than a cave?
Whatever. It'll do.
Sister!
(both squealing)
(chuckles)
Winston: Oh, that's some sisterly love right there.
Let me get you two a drink.
Okay.
(squeals)
Oh, my God, Winston is so good for you.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
And I saw with my own eyes one day when Winston saved those kids from a burning building, including a little boy.
A little boy who's dad left when he was young.
Named Wheelchair Timmy.
Wheelchair Timmy was a heavyset boy, ginger.
Black eyes.
So what, you think I'm just some cold robot who needs some guy to loosen me up, make me happy?
I just said Winston's good for you.
Oh, my God, you always get like this!
He grabs the kid and the chair, lifts him up above his head, so that the f*re doesn't burn this little heavyset boy.
That's the power of adrenaline.
And what happened to Timmy?
Timmy? He's d*ad.
What?
He's alive. I'm Timmy.
Look at me now.
Because of Winston, I'm telling you this story.
No, you said your name was Nick.
I am Nick. I got to go!
How should I be, huh? Like you?
(mocking): "Oh, my God, look at me, I'm Leslie. I wear holiday socks in the summer. I follow Ariana Grande around like she was the Grateful d*ad."
(mocking): "Oh, I'm Aly. I went to Quantico and I got a disease, and I can't be around people!"
Do you mean "quarantine"?
Whatever!
You're so mean!
You're being a mean robot!
No, this is being a mean robot.
(robotic voice): "Beep, boop, boop, boop. Leslie, you suck. You can't pull off bangs. You were an accident."
Leslie: Oh, my God! I have a small forehead, and you know that, and you use that against me!
Just shut up!
I hate you!
I hate you! I...
(Leslie sobs)
(whispers): God.
(sighs) Oh, no.
The wheelchair boy, Timmy, speaks very highly of you.
(chuckles)
You're Aunt Karen?
Mm-hmm.
You didn't make a lot of sense.
(grunts)
Yeah, it's really coming down out there.
It's really freezing.
Yeah.
(thunder rumbling softly)
Hey, Robby?
Do you ever think it's, like... it's not good that we're so similar?
Oh, I don't know.
You know, my Great Uncle Shep Wallingford used to say "You buy the horse that you see in the mirror."
Did you say "Wallingford"?
Mm-hmm.
I have Wallingfords in my family, out near Boston.
Ah, mine are in, uh, Newburyport.
They were kind of, like, local celebrities.
They were well-known for making... women's watches.
... Women's watches.
How'd you know that?
♪ Wallingford watches ♪
Both: ♪ 'Cause the time is now ♪
♪ And the look is wow! ♪
(chuckles)
Robby...
I think we're related.
(thunder rumbles)
(Jess and Robby screaming)
(Jess and Robby screaming)
Do you have an Uncle Tony?
Tony, with the long fingernails, and he always wears a whistle around his neck.
Robby, we are third cousins.
Oh, my God!
Ah!
Why, God?!
We're going to hell!
(groans)
We did stuff.
No, stop!
Just saying.
I can't live in this reality!
At least not second cousins.
Ah, I can't.
First cousins would be way worse.
Please, no.
People do it all the time, in the, in the mountains.
In the mountains.
(retches)
Don't be startled.
God!
What are you doing in here, Cece?
I am hiding, okay?
That party is out of control.
Some guy almost b*rned his eyebrows off trying to light a cigarette on our stove.
It's complete anarchy in there.
Can we just hide in here and hang out together?
We haven't christened the garage yet.
Ooh, you make a very good point.
Okay.
Winston: Hey.
Hello, Winston.
Hey.
Question: have you guys seen Aly?
(sighs)
What's going on, man?
She ran off. If I'd known it was gonna be like this, I would've just done the trench coat thing.
The... what?
What is the trench coat thing?
It's where I pick her up from the airport naked, wearing nothing but a trench coat.
Have you guys seen a kid in a wheelchair?
That was me.
What?
Whoa!
Wow.
Nick, what are you doing in here?
Look, I was having a hard time with your stories, so I took a little poetic license.
People started asking some questions.
Things got ahead of me.
And I had no choice but to hide in the car.
Nick, I thought you were gonna stick to the tub story.
It's not a story, Winston. It's not a story!
A story about sleeping...
It's mental.
It's really not...
Hey.
Found her.
Yeah.
Hey, are you guys ever not together?
Rarely.
You know what? Hold on one second.
I want to talk to you. Guys, can you give us a minute?
Sure, Winston. Cece, let's go hide in the car... in the garage of our home.
Yeah, okay.
We'll give you guys a minute.
Aly, uh, I was just trying to be sweet and...
And I ruined it. I know.
I said my family was crazy, and I ended up being the craziest one.
Look, I'm so embarrassed you saw that side of me, and I'm sure you want to run for the hills.
So, it's fine. I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed of being crazy in front of me?
I acted insane.
Even just talking about it is humiliating.
I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna walk away.
Okay.
Oh, dear Lord.
The car's running.
Nick, how long have you been in here?
Been running this whole time?
I was cold. I was cold.
Did you ever go to one of those big Wallingford family cookouts?
Just one, in '92.
I remember they had a really competitive three-legged race, and they paired me up with a little boy who had a helmet on.
His skin was so translucent, it was like he was a jellyfish.
Did he play an imaginary trombone?
Yeah.
He kept saying, "It's better to be safe than speedy."
That was me! That was me!
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is too much.
I don't want to die with my cousin-lover in a cave.
Oh, God.
Everyone will think we fled here 'cause society wouldn't accept us.
I just wanted to see a waterfall.
Me, too! I got to get out of here!
You can't walk, I can't see anything.
Stand up, blind boy. I'm getting on your back.
Take these.
Oh, okay.
Oh, man. Okay.
We have the same prescription.
Yeah, no kidding, Robby. All right, you ready?
Yeah. So, "Wallingfords" on three?
No! Ew!
I'm really sorry. I'm so nervous.
Okay, one, two, three!
Two, three!
(both yelling)
Robby: I didn't wear the right shoes for this!
Jess: Go over there!
I'm sorry about before.
I guess I really freaked out on you.
And I'm sorry that I told you I was gonna shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.
You never said that.
Oh, maybe I was just thinking that.
I'm just so embarrassed Winston saw that.
I'm pretty sure I scared him off.
No, you didn't. He's on the table.
(tapping glass)
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Winston: Hello.
I am Winston Bishop.
I'm Aly's boyfriend.
Please, if you will, I want to, uh, say a few words to my girlfriend.
He's standing on the furniture.
Just relax, okay? Help is on the way.
Aly, I wanted you to feel special tonight because... I'm wild about you.
Maybe things didn't go perfectly, but damn it, don't be embarrassed to be crazy in front of me.
Okay? I am the king of crazy.
(chuckles)
I have inside jokes with my cat.
I am a member of the Puzzling Guild of North America.
I shave my face cold, and I brush my teeth hot.
It's true.
On one very late and very desperate night, I used Furguson's cat box as my own box.
And, yes, it is true what many of you have heard.
I once fell asleep in a bathtub!
(laughing)
I love that story.
(continues laughing)
And then what happened?
What do you mean, "And then what happened?"
He fell asleep in the tub!
He was asleep, and then he woke up.
(stomping on table)
I don't know, maybe I got to hear it again.
So who cares if you're crazy?
I don't care. I'm crazy, too.
(scoffs) Watch this.
I'm gonna put a carrot behind my ear, like a bunny reporter, and I'm gonna do this dance I've been working on for five years.
(grunting rhythmically)
Don't you do that carrot.
Little bunny carrot.
(imitates chewing)
(Winston mumbling goofy noises)
(laughs)
I see we got two new... people here.
Who are they?
Yeah, um, Mom, Dad, this is Winston.
Hey.
(chuckles)
Uh... I am Winston.
And I assure you that all of those incidents were from a very long time ago, kinda.
It's clear you love our daughter.
In a very passionate, unique way.
That's all that matters.
(chuckles)
(mouthing)
You're a two-hander, huh?
(laughs)
Well, all right.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Seriously, we've been on the road for a couple of hours.
We need to use the bathroom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course!
It's, uh, right down, right down the hall.
(chuckles)
Thank you for not being afraid of me or my family.
(knocking)
Open up. Police!
Who-who called the police?
I don't know.
I guess we better do whatever they say. Ugh.
Why are you guys acting like you're in a p*rn?
(sighs)
We got a noise complaint.
The law has spoken, everyone.
I guess the party's over.
You could just file out through here.
Winston?
(chuckles): Look who it is.
Hey, Aly, you're back.
Jenkins, get in here, man! We having a party.
What you drinking?
Hi, Jenkins.
Wait, what?
(laughs)
Well, you know what, I guess I'm just gonna have to take the law into my own hands.
All right, everybody!
Shoes off, coasters down!
This is our house, and our house has rules! Okay?
Not a suggestion. Shoes off, let's go!
Okay, okay. Shoes off.
Shoes.
Schmidt: Take your shoes off...
Get 'em off!
... and put 'em to the side!
Yep!
And then let's have a good time.
Yeah, let's have some fun.
It's a party, people.
It's a party.
Robby: So just to be clear, um, we're definitely broken up, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, that's...
Yeah. I mean...
I don't know why I asked.
Well...
Oh, wait. You should take these.
Oh, you know, keep 'em. They look great on you.
Thank you.
I'll see you around.
Yeah.
Maybe at the next family reun...
Too soon. Yep.
A little too soon. Yes.
Oh, dear Lord.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm really, I'm really clean underneath all this mud.
Oh, my God, what happened?
(sighs) Hike took a turn, and then Robby and I broke up in a cave.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I am so sorry.
Air hug.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get you a glass of wine.
Real sorry about you and Robby. Don't touch anything.
I'm gonna go get some paper towels. Don't-don't move.
Whoa, Jess! Are you okay?
Oh, long story.
But I'm okay. Is there any food left?
I'm so hungry, and all I have is this bag of gross raisins.
Gross raisins? Are you kidding me?
Raisins are the best. I love raisins.
(laughs): Of course you do.
Yeah, sometimes I just tuck 'em in my cheek, and I go about my day, so if I ever need the flavor of raisins, well, I already got it.
I'm having trouble envisioning what it's like to need the flavor of raisins.
But go nuts.
Go raisins. (laughs)
You said, "Go nuts," I said, "Go raisins."
Cece: Wine.
Paper towels.
Jess: Oh, thank you, Schmidt.
Thanks. Oh, thanks.
Thanks. Thank you.
Schmidt: Just step on these.
Nick: Go faster.
Jess: Uh, I have enough paper towels.
Winston: Hey!
Jess: Hey!
Hey, what's up?
Not much.
Welcome to the party.
Thanks.
Where's Robby?
Jess: Oh, yeah, um, he couldn't make it.
Turns out we're cousins, so...
Nick: What?!
Cece: What?
Nick: He's your cousin?
Jess: House looks great.
Nick: Wait a second.
Thank you.
What?
How did that happen?
Nick: Cousin?
Commentator: They've scored five touchdowns in this game...
Wow. Check this out.
Coach and May's foreign exchange student just added me as a friend.
Montsie. His name is Montsie.
I didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.
I didn't know they moved to North Carolina.
Neither did I.
(they laugh)
They moved to North Carol... what?
Yeah.
How did none of us know about this? How is that possible?
Eh, they moved. It happened.
We need to make more of an effort.
We don't even know that our friend has moved to a different state.
I mean, we're still friends.
We just have nothing to do with each other.
This doesn't bother you?
Realistically, we'll probably see 'em two or three more times before we die.
And it's sad, but it's also not that sad.
What?
Who cares? What's for dinner?
I care.
McKenna, please. Please, don't do this. Okay? I mean, what about that formal swimwear ad I got you? McKenna?
McKen...?
Well, guys! It happened again.
A big agency stole another one of my clients.
And I have a big audition today.
Gosh darn it. You know what?
Cece: Jess!
Those pretty boys don't deserve you.
Which one is McKenna? Is he the gaunt, heroin-hot one?
That's Jean Francois. He got poached last week.
McKenna's the one that looked like a jacked Bryant Gumbel.
Oh...
And this is a huge deal!
It's the Sausage Crunchies account!
Why would a dog food company be interested in a bunch of hot models?
Oh, no, it's, uh...
Nick: No, no, no.
Sausage Crunchies are people food.
They're like brown cheese snacks.
Yeah, it's like space food. I-I put them in soup.
Cece: I just really wanted to show this casting agency that I was legit.
Now, if I go down there with just Donovan, I'm gonna look like a no-name hustler.
Gosh darn it.
Should I go out now, and try to find new clients, or should I concentrate on the one client that I have left?
You know, they're probably sniffing around Donovan as we speak.
(gasps) Crap.
Is that what he wants to talk to me about?
He said he wanted to talk to me about something.
Is that what he wanted to talk to me about?
These poachers.
Cece... Cece, calm.
You concentrate on Donovan.
I'll go see if I can drum up some new clients.
Very sweet, but the audition is in six hours from now.
So we have no time to look for new clients.
Well, recruiting is just like sales, I mean selling a job is just like selling drugs. I do that every day.
Are you offering to help, too?
Honestly, I wasn't.
But based on how intensely you're staring at me, I guess I've boxed myself into a corner here, so...
Great! Okay. You concentrate on Donovan.
We'll get the models. Heads in, guys.
What?
"Heads in"?
No. It's "hands in."
I'm pretty sure it's "heads in."
What are we supposed to do? Smoosh our heads together?
Yeah.
Everybody. Hands in.
Hands in.
Hands in.
Winston: Meow.
Schmidt: Winston!
What?
How are you not tired of this?
Tired of what?
♪ ♪
Okay, model types, 3:00.
Take a bow.
Wait, those two oatmeal men?
Follow my lead.
How did we ever date the same dude?
(laughs): Hey!
Kampai. That's Japanese for "What's up?"
Hi! Jessica Day.
What are we celebrating?
Kirby here works for a marine biologist. and he got them to name a new species of sea slug after me.
Oh!
It's called Bruce's Eastern Sea Slug.
You two are fascinating.
Have you ever considered modeling?
Kirby: I actually have. A-a lot.
Us?
I have a rich fantasy life.
Oh.
I can't wait to hear more about that.
Sounds so great.
What are you doing?
Those guys are obviously not model material.
Because they're not cookie-cutter hot?
Cece needs a bunch of different guys, so don't judge a book by its cover.
Except when you're talking about models.
Models exist to be on covers.
I think that's an oversimplification.
I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.
Something, something that makes them stand apart.
Like a gap in their lower teeth, or a neck nipple.
You're making this way too complicated.
Look, this is all it needs to be... you walk up to a hot guy, okay?
And you say "Hey, you're hot.
"Do you want to be a model?"
You have to forge a connection with them.
And that way they entrust us with the thing that makes them really beautiful.
You know what? You do your thing.
I'll do my thing.
But your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.
Sea slugs, Reagan.
They're sea slug guys.
But you're right.
You're nasty about it, but you're right.
Cece: So, Donovan, you have something you want to tell me?
(inhales, exhales)
I've... made a big decision.
No, Donovan, don't.
I'm gonna stop wearing beanies.
Wait, what?
I think. I...
That's what you wanted to talk to me about?
I thought some big agency was trying to poach you.
No. (chuckles)
They've just been sending me baskets and trying to take me to fancy dinners and stuff.
What?
They've just been giving me baskets and trying...
Listen to me, okay?
I know that gift baskets are great.
Yeah.
They are.
But once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.
Because they don't care about you.
All they care about are numbers.
But you, Donovan, you are my first priority.
So when you're with me, you will never feel neglected.
Just tell me what you need. I got you.
I need someone to help me get better at tricks on my motorcycle.
Sure.
(grunts) Mmm.
I really hate these things. I just can't stop eating 'em.
I got to say, the taste is average, but the aftertaste is outstanding.
What happens when I'm just an outstanding aftertaste?
Hmm?
When I move out, are you guys gonna forget about me like Coach?
This loft is what tethers us together.
And once it's gone, we're gonna be spread across the Earth like Rod Stewart's offspring.
What I'm gonna miss most about you is all this poetry.
No, no, no. You know what, do not give up on us already.
We just need to find something that keeps us together.
Like a dark secret or a time-share.
You know, it was easier when men went to w*r.
You'd forge an unbreakable bond in a crucible of blood and pain.
You can't get that splitting the cost of toilet paper.
We just need to come up with some sort of ritual.
Yes! Now you're thinking.
We stand in a circle, right?
We burn chicken bones, all right?
Dear Lord, Winston.
Then we're just secretive about it.
This is the wrong ritual...
I'm just saying no one knows about it.
I didn't literally mean a ritual.
Oh.
I just mean, like, a shared experience, one that bonds us together.
I've been saying this for the longest time, but I'm really ready to get super weird into metal detectors if you guys are.
That's, sure, that's one idea.
You can look for treasure.
Nickels, dimes, quarters.
If you find enough, um, said treasure or change, supplement your income.
It's also entertaining.
While looking, there's, uh, an endorphin rush.
It's entertainment, it's income... uh, ritual.
Why don't we get tracksuits and play chess at the park?
I already got a chess crew.
♪ ♪
You do that right outside of the loft?
Yeah, right outside the loft.
How have I never seen you once?
'Cause you don't go outside of the loft.
That's just not true.
Fellas, fellas, fellas, I got it.
Yeah? Metal detectors?
That's a super cool idea, man.
I appreciate the idea. I want to hear more about it.
I feel like I'm being teased.
Let me guess, you guys are pre-gaming before your high school reunion.
You were nerds, but you grew up to be super handsome.
You were cool but approachable.
Maybe you were rollerbladers...
Okay. Here's the deal.
You're all models now, and that's your new manager.
H-hold on a sec. There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.
Oh. (laughs)
You think we're trying to pick you up, because we're at a bar and we're telling you how handsome you are.
Excuse me.
You're hot, and you're about to make the easiest decision of your life.
Not interested.

Don't tell me. Only child, right?
I guess now I am.
As of yesterday.
Sorry, did you... did you...
It's loud. Did you hear what I, I said?
I said you were hot.
Um, have you ever thought about modeling?
Lady, you can't treat me like a piece of meat.
Now, I know I'm hot, but I don't need your validation.
We're trying to have a serious conversation here about why the bees have disappeared.

So, how'd you do?
Got a couple irons in the f*re, so...
Me, too, me, too. Planted a couple seeds, just waiting for the harvest.
Hey! Hey, you.
Stop what you're doing right now.
What? I'm sorry.
That's just how I walk.
If I don't swing my arms, I start thinking I'm standing, and I'll fall.
Oh... (chuckles)
Tell me, do you have any modeling experience?
I was trapped in a window display in a department store once, and I was on the news a lot.
Are we talking local or national news?
Oh, that's a good question.
Um...
I think... sorry... what my friend is trying to say is that it sounds like you have on-camera experience, and if you would like, we can hook you up with a top talent manager who could get you an audition today.
I do like hooking my thumb into my belt loops, and pulling my pants down...
Yeah. No. Don't do it now.
But it is called "The Cowboy."
And I can see it's not your first rodeo.
Okay. Uh, your new manager's name is Cece.
Go to that address.
Thanks. Okay.
No, don't say it.
We're a team.
No.
I'm the bait, you're the hook.
I don't think the bait usually thinks of the hook as its teammate.
That's such a hook thing to say.
You're such a hook.
You know...
I've always wanted to have a boys spa day.
Nick, did you wear your shirt during the massage?
I did, but no bottoms.
It was liberating.
Good for you.
Check this out. These cucumbers are gratis.
(laughs) I'm gonna make some pickles.
If you're impressed by a couple of free cucumbers, get ready to have your blind bl*wn, 'cause I signed us up for the elite package.
Does that mean the pickle's already pickled?
Gentlemen, eucalyptus towels?
Thank you.
Oh, yeah... uh, mine's already wet!
No, no, no, it's for smelling, not drying.
Oh.
Put it up to your face, smell it.
Mmm. How could a smell be both hot and cold at the same time, I ask.
It's nice.
Ooh, this place is dope.
Man, I feel very Roman.
Boys, I think we found our ritual.
(laughing) Yeah, we did.
If you gentlemen are ready, I can take you to your Brazilians.
(laughs) Sounds very fun.
I'm in a relationship, myself.
Yeah.
Uh, but I would love to look.
Just point me to the door, please.
Sir. The elite package at S'Pa includes the wax removal of hair from your nether regions.
What did you say, homeboy?
Scrotum wax.
No, Schmidt.
Say something.
Say something to him.
Cece: Donovan.
I have some very good news.
I have a brand-new client that I am very excited for you to meet.
I'm Dean and I'm a model.
Mm-hmm.
But I'm a model.
No. I'm a model.
Yeah, both models.
No. I'm a model.
No. I-I am a model.
I am... I'm the model.
But, like, I'm, but I model.
I'm a model.
I model.
You...
I'm a model.
I just told... I'm a model.
Astro Fuel.
I model.
What the heck is going on?
Well, Cece's Boys is growing, so I'm just gonna help Dean make a résumé for the big audition we're all gonna go on.
What about my résumé?
You already have a résumé.
Well, I-I-I want another one.
And another sandwich.
I want a sandwich, too.
Stop copying me!
Donovan. Dean.
Reagan: Um...
Hmm.
(indistinct chatter)
No...
The line between what we're doing and being creepy is so thin.
(cell phone rings)
Hey, Cece, what's up?
Any luck? The audition's in an hour, I'm getting kind of panicky.
Yeah. Totally. Um... we're just looking for that perfect Cece's Boys type, you know... perfect.
Ow!
I don't know hair this short can get so tangled!
Okay?
You're hurting me.
I'm very sorry.
Donovan: Cece, I don't know how many buttons to do on my shirt.
Donovan, please.
Look, Jess.
If you haven't found anyone by now, maybe I should just cut my losses.
Maybe I should just tell them I only...
No, no, no, no, no. We actually, um...
(clears throat) we have two guys, we'll...
You do? Oh!
... bring them right over.
You are the best. Thank you!
I'm sorry?
I'm gonna be honest.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
Oh, it-it's the other one.
No.
They have a real look.
What look would that be?
I own my own dog-walking company?
Branding!
You're good.
You know what? I believe in them.
And we also have no other choice.
So let's get them camera-ready.
How far away is that camera gonna be?
(laughs)
Okay, guys, let's go... Oh, hey, Kirby.
Looking good.
That is for cats.
But it's okay. Put this on.
They're from my roommate's earthquake kit.
He has a three-week supply.
Bruce. Put this on. They won't recognize you on your next volunteer shift at the hospital.
Ah. Jess.
Hallway.
Okay, are you absolutely sure that this is the way to go?
Can't we get our hands on, like, a water polo team?
Or hire escorts?
Or call in a b*mb thr*at to the audition.
In this political environment?
Oh, I'm nervous even saying it.
What about nothing?
No!
Is nothing maybe the right thing to do in this situation?
We can't bail on Cece. This is her sh*t.
We can't let her become irrelevant like chunky belts, or quoting Borat.
Okay. Well, if I have to go down with the ship, I'm not going down without a fight.
And those two are gonna need a lot more than hair gel and V-necks.
They're gonna need motorcycle boots, scarves, knit caps, and all the eye makeup that Schmidt's got.
Dean (muffled): Cece?
Hello?
Cece?
(muttering)
What are you doing in here?
Donovan told me to wait here in your break room and then he left.
What?!
And I couldn't open the door and it was really dark.
Donovan, get in here right now!
Donovan, we have an audition in an hour and you lock Dean in a closet?
Well, you said I was your number one client.
Okay. No. Wait, Donovan.
I'm out of here.
Just calm down. Wait.
I went the wrong way. Don't look.
(whispering): So, what are we thinking?
I don't know. Maybe they give you something to bite down on.
No, I'm talking about leaving!
You're being so dramatic right now.
I don't think I'm being dramatic.
Look, I'll say it now without any drama.
I don't want the hairs ripped off my testicles by a stranger.
I think they're there for a reason.
They are trained professionals in there.
This isn't gonna be some back-alley sack waxing.
They have those?
I'm sure they do, but this isn't one of them.
Who would go to that one?
(sputters) Well, sometimes, in an emergency, you got to do what you got to do.
What would the emergency ever be?
Nick, this is gonna be like cottage cheese all over again.
At first, you're gonna be kicking and screaming, saying that you don't want to try it, but I'm telling you, in the end, you're gonna tell everybody that you meet how much you loved it.
This is nothing like cottage cheese.
Exactly like cottage cheese.
Guys, I have off-the-charts follicle strength, okay?
It'll be a blood bath down there, a real crime scene, so I'm leaning, "No."
I'm out! Like my mother says at every party she goes to, "No one touches my purse."
Good day.
Wait. Sit. Sit down.
You guys don't need to leave.
Just a minute ago, you were saying how much you love this place.
Just don't get your sack waxed.
Okay, I don't care how big the park is.
If there is a loose bear in it, I'm not going in the park!
I'm never going in that park again!
I'm never going in again!
But this is our ritual!
Schmidt, we'll just find a new one.
Easy for you to say.
You two guys are still gonna be living together in the loft, saying, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
"I didn't know you were in here in the bathroom."
And coming up with clever names for the Wi-Fi network like, "This Is 4D."
That's pretty good.
I'd say we just... let's agree right now to switch it to that.
Points is, is your lives are going to go on, and I'll just always be that weirdo you once lived with.
So you know what?
I am gonna get my sack waxed.
So enjoy the rest of your lives together.
I'm gonna go shuck this corn.
Oh, man.
Hey, do you think they'll take a picture of him just as they rip like they do on roller coasters?
I think you missed the point of what just happened.
(laughing)
Did you just see that?
No. I had my eyes closed.
I was saying a non-denominational prayer for Bruce and Kirby. What did I miss?
That woman just checked out our guys.
Like, she-she really checked them out.
Maybe we have a chance. I don't know.
Did you hear what you just said?
What?
You said, "Our guys."
Okay, let's just go in.
Our guys!
Don't get sentimental.
Our guys.
Oh, you get off of me.
Our guys!
(indistinct chatter)
Jess, I asked for models, not a couple of driver's ed instructors!
I know, Cece, but they're hot on the inside.
Bruce teaches CPR to children with irregular mouths, and Kirby has given so much bone marrow, they told him to stop.
I don't know how that's gonna help them at a print ad audition.
You're right, she's right.
I don't know what we were thinking.
Let's go put these dogs down.
Why did we even give them names?
They came with names.
Right, I guess what I meant is why did we bothering learning them.
Guys, uh, there's been a little hiccup.
We're allowed to eat all these, right?
I just love them.
Yeah, you guys can keep eating. Um, so, there's no way to sugarcoat this, but the truth is...
(shushing)
Wait, wait, wait...
So gross, right?
Ooh, nasty!
(shushing) Cece? Cece, come here.
What?
Look around this room.
Nobody's eating these things but them.
Oh, my God, yes!
And they love them.
It almost makes me want to try them.
And I emphasize "almost."
They're making a mistake.
These are the guys that can sell this stuff.
Not these guys.
But they've already decided on the direction of the ad.
So tell them to change it!
I mean, what have you got to lose?
Hey, Joy.
I'm scared.
Nick: Don't you be scared, kid!
Nick?
We're here with you, buddy!
Winston!
Nick: We don't need a ritual, Schmidt, 'cause you're not gonna lose us.
I thought we could've just told you that, but Winston thought we needed to show it.
Yeah, I thought that would be better.
You know, it makes more sense to me.
Band of brothers.
Band of brothers!
That's right, man. Band of brothers, bro.
Band of brothers.
You know, I've been a little bit curious about it this whole time.
I just couldn't admit it to you guys, you know?
I think this would be more dignified if we did it in silence.
Schmidt: Of course.
Yeah, let's do this in silence.
Good luck, guys.
I'm ready for you, lady.
Three friends going on the same silent journey, together, yet separate, alone, yet closer than ever.
(screaming)
Nick?
I'm all right!
(paper ripping, Winston screaming)
Schmidt: Winston?
Can you hear me, Schmidt?!
You hang in there, you son of a... (screaming)
Aah! This woman's ripping it off!
(shrieking)
Ooh! That's actually kind of warm. Ouch!
No! Okay, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out!
(paper rips)
(slowed-down, distorted speech)

(slowed-down yelling)
(slow-motion, distorted): No, no, no! No!
(yelling, ripping sound)
(yelling)
(ripping sound)
(distorted yelling)
(distorted groaning)
(distorted yelling)
(distorted): Oh!
(yelling and howling)
How many times do you freakin' do it?!
Okay, good. You both are here.
So, guess who got the Sausage Crunchies job.
(gasps) Oh, yay, Kirby!
Hey, Kirby!
Not Kirby, but I am going to hang on to him.
I think he could book ads for both fast food and anti-depressants.
Ah.
Bruce?
They absolutely hated Bruce.
He got sick during the audition.
Sausage Crunchies everywhere.
That's a lot.
But they loved Dean!
Mm. (laughs)
Oh, it's nice to see the good guys win.
Right?! They said I brought them the best and the worst of the day, so... maybe that's my thing.
Hmm.
Can I throw out this, uh, soggy bag of cucumbers?
Winston: No!
Those are pickles in progress.
(groaning)
Um, I don't mean to be mean, but you guys are being real babies about this whole thing.
(laughs) They don't...
Until you've had your sack waxed, you can't know this pain.
Excuse me?
Childbirth?
Weekly wax, top to tail.
We went through hell, and we came out the other side, gentlemen.
It was w*r.
Granted, one that took place in a high end-spa, but still our w*r.
(laughs)
That's right.
I mean, this not something we do every week, right?
No, it's like a monthly thing.
Monthly?
Not a chance!
It's our ritual.
No. No, no, no, no. One time only.
Guys, how can it be a ritual if we only do it one time?
Shut up, Schmidt! I will never go back!
(Winston crying)
Nick: It's okay, man. We're gonna get metal detectors.
To Cece, for booking her first client's first modeling gig.
All: Hey!
Robby: Cheers.
And to Winston for making Donovan the face of LAPD's recruitment campaign.
I just hope he doesn't look better in blue than I do.
Wink.
Oh, he definitely will. He's a model.
(clears throat) So in honor of this occasion, we all got you gifts for your home office.
You may know it by its former name, the dining room table.
Me first. A cubicle, swinging b*lls, Mm. an outgoing mailbox, a cartoon that is very derogatory towards Mondays.
So thoughtful, babe.
Will that mailbox be functional?
If it wasn't, it would just be a box, wouldn't it?
So can I buy a stamp for this letter?
It's not a post office, man.
Who else has a gift?
Whoo! Bull button.
You press that, guaranteed crowd pleaser.
Button: Bull!
Ooh!
(laughter)
I got something better.
Noise-canceling headphones.
Thank you. Wow.
Yeah, are those mine?
Yes.
They're broken.
Oh, nothing is ever truly broken.
All right, well, I got you a filing cabinet to file all the headshots of your clients.
FYI, Ferguson's in one of those drawers making fluffies.
"Fluffies" is cat farts.
Bull!
(laughter)
♪ ♪
Do you have a stamp for this letter?
Is that a bill from when you were in the hospital?
Oh, this? Yeah, it is.
Turns out they, uh, they charge for new knees.
(Robby chuckles, Jess scoffs)
I feel so bad.
I should pay that.
What? Why?
Seriously?
(yelling and grunting)
(cr*ck, Robby yelling)
Oh my God, your bad knee! Oh, my God!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But wait a second, why do you want to pay?
I turned your knee into a bag of marbles.
I should pay your medical bill.
This is my only bill, and it's just a baby bill.
You know, it's so small and cute, like my nephew Baby Bill.
Give me that baby.
I feel bad, but okay.
Wait, how did you...
(gasps)
I studied pickpocketing when I played the Artful Dodger in my college production of Oliver!
Oh, wow, that's so cool.
Oh, wait, so did I.
What...
Ow, Winston, straighten your arms when you eat.
You don't think I want to?
Ain't no room, fam.
Straighten your arms, fam.
Then how am I gonna reach my food?
Oh.
Okay, I'm sorry, the cubicle will be gone soon, but this is a real make-or-break moment for me.
Either I'll look back at this as my "Steve Jobs in the garage" phase, or that misguided month where I tried to be a manager at the dining room table.
You are absolutely Jobs.
And I'm Woz sitting next to you the whole time in a... slightly lower chair.
(chuckles)
And speaking of jobs, by the way, you guys need to be like Winston and start getting jobs for Donovan.
Don't you basically work on ads for a living, Schmidt?
Yeah, well, my current account is for a menopause pill that eliminates night sweats.
Oh, you're repping EstroFuel?
Yes. Chest bump.
Nick: You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.
I mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but...
Gator!
Oh, Gator!
It's perfect.
(laughter)
He could be a great Gator.
Why don't you just use a real gator?
Schmidt: What?
Gator is Pepperwood's best friend... and clairvoyant brother.
Mm.
Oh, my bad. Sorry, I haven't read it yet.
What?
Winston: What?
Doesn't matter.
Clear the next 24 hours.
You haven't read it?
It's really not that big of a deal.
I also don't have an extra hard copy so let's just talk about something else.
Ooh, you can take mine.
(sighs)
I've highlighted the more sexual parts.
I'm not ashamed.
Great.
Great.
Now you get to read it.
Now I get to read it.
Robby's hospital bill is only $400.
That seem low to you?
Did he have a minor procedure?
No, he had what the doctors call "a full Frankenstein."
They put dog bones in his knee.
Then that's way off.
It's got to be much higher.
Do you think he thinks I can't afford the full amount?
(all agreeing)
What? Teachers have money.
You guys know how large I live. I'm flush with cash.
I'm paying that bill.
I'm going to the bank right now.
I'm probably gonna take a limousine.
Taking a limo to the bank. What is she, a cartoon cat?
(both laugh)
He kills it every time.
Every time, man.
I'm sorry we got in a fight.
I feel close again.
I'm not.
Okay, Donovan, you just caught a shoplifter and now you're celebrating with a street taco.
That's exactly it!
Get him, Donovan.
I love this.
Get him, Cece.
Yeah, okay.
Donovan, you're a natural cop.
Hey, what agency are you from? 2L?
Oh, um, hmm, I'm... from an agency that is uh, quite, um... but...
Cece's Boys.
Cece's Boys, where the men are boys, and the-and the boys are Cece's.
All right.
You like it?
I love it.
You're going downtown!
Cece: Anything you say, Officer.
(playing complicated melody)
Oh, hi, Jess.
That was really good.
Just laying down a t*nk B line.
Cool, cool. Hey, um, I feel like Baby Bill here has a lot of brothers and sisters.
So what's the real total?
No, Jess, that's it, I swear.
Come on, Robby, $400?
I know what's going on here.
You think I'm too poor to pay.
I...
But you know what?
Would a poor person... do this?
How much is it? How much?
Jess, I'm not gonna tell you, okay?
Unless you ask me repeatedly, in which case I'll eventually cr*ck. Damn it.
What's the total?
Uh.. no.
What's the total?
No.
What's the total?
Not gonna tell you.
(repeating quickly): What's the total?
$200,000.
(plays Seinfeld opening theme)
Seinfeld.
Moment of truth.
Yep, here it is.
So please don't feel any pressure to like it, even though I spent 7,000 hours writing it.
So without further ado, or as Pepperwood would say, "Ah-don't." (chuckles)
You'll get that when you read it.
Here it is.
Here it is.
I cannot wait to read this.
I cannot wait to R-E-A...
Jess!
Jess!
Hey, there she is.
Oh, me, hey.
(chuckles)
Sorry to interrupt. Are you re-reading The Pepperwood Chronicles?
It is actually my very first time.
A TPC virgin.
Yeah.
"Ah-don't..." believe it. (chuckles)
I'll get out of your hair.
No, no, no, stay.
No, what is all that stuff in your hands?
I'm totaling my assets.
It's really bleak.
You can't say that and then not elaborate, right?
No, I feel like we should really unpack this.
Really?
Definitely.
Thanks, guys.
Well, Robby's medical bills are a fifth of a million dollars and I'm freaking out.
I almost rounded up all my ballet flats and sold them on flattyflattyboomboom.com, the premier website for used flats.
Well, there are other options. There are other options.
Um, as somebody who passed the bar exam eight years ago, I could offer you legal expertise.
I could read the medical paperwork.
Oh! An almost lawyer and a sort of doctor.
Lucky me. Okay.
Strategy sesh in the cubicle.
I'll meet you guys there.
Or we can go... all go together if you want.
Together.
Yeah.
Yeah, let's go together.
Great.
I rewrote the EstroFuel ad to star a hunk, and I got Donovan the gig.
(Cece laughs)
Winston: Whoo!
Hey, everybody, Yes!
I just want to let you know, I've thought about it, and I'm quitting modeling to focus on applying to police school.
Honey, that is a very radical career change, okay?
That's why I like it. I can't be tied down.
Picture this: your mom has night sweats.
She needs relief.
Luckily, she has a handsome son to go pick up her supplements, because menopause isn't just about women anymore.
EstroFuel: putting the men back in menopause.
Starring Donovan.
Wow.
(whooping)
That's... wow, what an opportunity.
But I'm becoming a cop.
No. No!
You are the face of EstroFuel.
The sh**t is tonight.
Oh, my God, it's tonight?
And I told my boss that Cece's Boys would be there.
You told your boss...
Thank you, I'll see you there.
Winston, you ready for the tour?
Hmm?
The what?
Huh? Yea... (chuckles)
Here's what happened, let me explain this.
Um, I offered Don a tour of the precinct, he accepted, and now it's happening.
(sighs)
Okay, Winston? Winston!
Yeah?
You better make sure that this is the worst tour that you've ever given anyone in your life.
And that's gonna be tough.
I've given some really bad tours.
(sighs)
Nick: Okay, does this rendering represent the incident in question?
There was way more blood.
Wait, come on, it was not this violent.
It was way worse. Grown men fainted.
Jess, I found something.
The hospital billed Robby for the Larry King Preemptive Memorial Post-Op Recovery Suite.
That's obviously a mistake.
Uh, that's not a mistake, actually.
I needed a private room because a lot of times in my dreams, I'm thinking about concerts that I really enjoy going to, so it's just a lot of me clapping and singing along.
(sighs)
I can't afford this.
Well, you don't have to, just let me pay.
No, you don't pay. I pay!
What if no one pays?
From my drawing, I don't see any signage.
Do you see any signage? So here's my question.
Do you remember seeing any safety signs near the machine?
This is important.
There was just a poster saying that they were closed on Veteran's Day.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Folks, we got a lawsuit. (chuckling)
Good job.
Great.
Seriously, guys, just let me pay this.
Say that one more time.
Say that you're gonna pay one more time and see what happens.
Wow, okay.
You know what usually calms me down?
A good mall walk.
No, we're suing the gym.
Nick, take it away.
Well, I would love to, but legally, I can't practice law.
Yeah, I have a really good lawyer, she's an animal.
So you're on board now?
Yeah, I just go with the flow.
(phone beeps)
I'm gonna call my gal.
We need the office.
Jess: What's wrong?
Yeah, so, Schmidt booked Donovan a photo sh**t at Ass Strat, but Donovan just quit modeling so that he could become a cop.
(phone ringing)
A cop?
It's my boss, Kim.
(sighing): God, I hate her.
Hello, Kimberly. You sound like your skin looks amazing.
All right, Reagan, you can get to reading.
We can stick around if you want us to.
I don't think it's necessary.
You need us?
We'll stick around for you.
I don't think so.
Nick: Yeah, we'll stick around.
Winston!
Winston!
Me!
Did you make police work look as boring as possible?
I want so badly to tell you yes, but there was a situation.
Protect and serve, more like protect and snooze.
(sighing): Yeah, this is boring.
Bishop, a word.
And the word is...
"moo."
All: Moo!
Shut up! I-I'm the C.O.W.?
I'm the... I'm the cop of the week?
All: ♪ Celebrate good times ♪
♪ Moo moo ♪
♪ Celebrate good times ♪
♪ Moo moo ♪
I'm home!
Well, congratulations, Winston, on finally making C.O.W.
And damn you!
Cece, we're gonna have go put out a menopause f*re.
Cece: Let's go!
I made C.O.W., though.
I made C.O.W., we ain't forgetting about all that.
Robby: Okay, so, my lawyer says I don't have a case against the gym because I signed a waiver.
A waiver? Jess, you did not say anything about a waiver.
Was that it?
She didn't advise me on anything else.
Okay. (chuckles)
No one says the word "advise" unless they got advice, so what did she advise?
Uh... oh, no.
What did she advise?
She didn't... it just wasn't...
What did she advise?
It didn't...
Come on, what did she advise?
She advised that I sue!
I knew it! Who?
You.
Me?
Nick, can I read your book?
I was just about to suggest it.
Nick: Let's get out of here.
Schmidt and Cece need me.
Whoa! God, what's that smell?
(coughs)
I'm not gonna sue you, Jess. Was that not clear?
I told my lawyer that you're just an innocent bystander.
Okay? So, if we can, uh, h*t the mall?
I mean, there is a big sale at this Japanese cereal store.
It sounds amazing.
You really think I was an innocent bystander, do you?
Is that bad?
Yeah.
I'm just saying that I don't really think that you, uh, ever do anything wrong.
(laughs) Anything? Ever?
Oh, we're starting to get into this.
Look... I know a great place where we can hash this over.
It's a place called Hash It Over.
It's in the food court at the mall, it's a hash brown...
We're not going to the mall.
Why are you watching...
Why am I watching you?
Why are you?
I'm not anymore.
Okay.
Weird to watch.
That's why I'm not gonna do it.
Great.
Bye.
I thought this was about a bill, but apparently, it's about our whole relationship.
How could I date someone who doesn't see me realistically?
No, but, Jess...
I mess stuff up all the time.
Ask Nick. He knows.
Nick, do I mess things up?
You know it, baby. Bye!
I promised I wouldn't come back, but it is a little uncomfortable out there.
(low snoring)
(sighs)
Jess, I know that you have flaws.
Okay, name one.
(chuckles)
Uh... (clears throat) Easy.
You walk too fast through a museum.
Although, it is pretty good, because we get to see everything and then we have time for the cafe afterwards.
I'm gonna say that overall it enriches the experience.
That is just a compliment!
I will be in the cubicle drinking myself numb.
Please, keep fighting.
Appreciate it.
Kim: I am paying a top-notch photographer to sit around and bitch about how hard it is to find French cigarettes in Los Angeles.
Where's the model?
Changing.
Yeah, um, uh, Donovan, are you almost ready?
Winston: I am changing.
I am Donovan.
What agency did you use again?
Cece's Boys.
Look... Cece herself showed up. She's very hands-on.
That's your wife. I've met her many times.
Schmidt, if this falls through...
Look, my client will be here, and if for some reason he's not, that is on me and only me.
I'm gonna go shout into a toilet.
Okay, well, what are we gonna do now?
Babe, we are not gonna do anything, okay?
You have done so much for me, more than any normal person, and I love you.
But if I am gonna graduate from the dining room table, I need to learn how to manage my clients on my own.
(sighs) Okay.
Oh, man, that was intense.
Uh, also, Schmidt, I printed something... do you know where it went?
Not now.
Okay.
Okay, it's voice mail.
Donovan...
I know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?
But that's why being a model is... perfect for you.
Because if you're a cop, then you're just gonna be a cop.
But if you're a model, then you can be everyone.
You can be an ice cream man, a rocketeer, a jewel thief, or an underwear guy in a 10 million dollar loft whose only furniture is a telescope.
So, help me... help you... become the everyone that you can be!
That's how you do it!
That was awesome!
Yes! (chuckles)
Right?
That was amazing.
It felt good.
You think it worked?
Couldn't tell you.
Robby: I know you're capable of messing up.
Really? Because you won't even admit that the gym thing is my fault.
Your lawyer wants you to sue me, and frankly, I agree with her.
So sue me.
I am not gonna sue you.
Then how can I ever trust you?
That doesn't make any sense.
You know what? If you're not gonna sue me, then get out of here.
Fine.
But I will tell you this: you will not be hearing from my lawyer.
Bye, Nick.
Nick: See you, Robby.
I forgot you were there.
Reagan was right.
These noise-canceling headphones are really broken.
I could hear everything.
God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?
You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.
Which, apparently, my book does not have.
Nick, everyone loves it.
Robby wrote fan fiction for it.
He wrote fan fiction?
(softly): Yeah.
That means the world to me.
He loves it so much.
Don't take this the wrong way about Robby, but... he is way too good for you.
(laughs)
He's way too good for everybody.
I know.
What is wrong with me?
(sighs heavily)
Oh...
Any insight, ex to ex?
Of what's wrong with you?
Oh, this feels like a trap.
(laughs)
Well, you know, maybe when things are going good, you get scared and you look for reasons to doubt it.
Yeah.
Is that what happened with us?
I mean, I can't begin to understand what happened with us, but maybe.
So, what are you gonna do about Reagan?
I don't know. Her opinion means a lot to me, so...
Well, I think that's good you're letting yourself be vulnerable.
Was I not that with you?
Who knows what happened with us?
We were just kids. Like... you had a box, and I wanted you to get a bank account.
Well, they're kind of the same thing.
Well...
You wanted to live on a lake; I wanted to live on Mars.
You wanted to be a truck driver on Mars, which is impractical.
Well, I need to work. I need to work.
I don't want to fight with you.
Let's not fight.
Let's not get into the details again.
Look, to getting older and wiser.
And hopefully, a little bit better.

Hey.
Hi.
Cool windbreaker.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I shouldn't be looking for things to go wrong.
It's just... a thing that I do.
I'm sorry, too.
I mean, sometimes I act more like a... superfan than a boyfriend.
And I don't want to do that with you.
I don't want to do my thing, either.
It's going really well.
Especially considering it started with you dropping 175 pounds of iron on my face.
So you admit it's my fault!
Okay, I'll admit that... it's half your fault.
I mean, look, I could have yelled out and said "stop" or something, but...
I wanted you to kiss me.

Because... I'm rich.
Okay, fine. But I am knitting you $200,000 worth of scarves.

Thank you for stopping me...

I don't know anything about Agatha Christie.
Honestly, I've never really liked fiction.
It puts me to sleep.
Okay.
That helps, to know that.
Why didn't you just say that before?
I was embarrassed, and I didn't want you to think that I'm not excited to read your book, because I am.

New Orleans was temporary. Okay?
Reagan has never stayed in one place too long.
If she thinks we're making a big deal, she's gonna feel smothered.
Okay? So you've got to do the opposite.
It's not a big deal.
That's why I didn't pick her up from the airport.
You didn't pick her up from the airport?
Didn't this woman change her whole job so she can move here to be with you?
She is gonna be pissed.

No, you're wrong. She's gonna be relieved.
Pissed.

Is "pool" cocaine?
I mean, is "the pool," like, a drug thing?
'Cause I don't "swim."
Like, I-I don't judge people who do "swim," but I don't.
No, it's a real pool.
An actual pool at my apartment, my other apartment.

No, no...
It's a secret.
Don't tell Nick, don't tell Nick.
No.

Oh, no.

Okay, well, it's time to do future Jess a solid and black the hell out.
Reagan has a secret apartment.
A secret apartment?
Past Jess was trying to keep me out of this.
What is she, a D.C. madam?
I have to make sure Nick never finds out about this.
You know what?
I'm gonna stay out of it.
Hmm.
Classic Jess, staying all the way out of it.
When we are done with this song, Schmidt will totally think it is by Diplo or Garrix or Deadmau5.
What is this?
Don't worry about that, your mind is in a weird situation.
First things first.
I recorded a bunch of noises around the loft.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
So we could use it as the hook.
It is the mark of any EDM song.
Okay.
Now, check this one out.
Nick shaving without shaving cream.
[Nick grunting]
He's bleeding at this point.
It's good, I'm just laughing at...
Yeah, it's nasty.
... just seeing him.
Okay, check this one out.
Schmidt: Haberman, my Haberman. Haberman. My Haberman. My-my-my-my Haberman.
This one has a pretty good rhythm to it.
All right, this one right here is about to set the city up topsy-turvy.
All right.

It's not... nothing.
Ferguson, you nasty.

You see, he's a gentle lover. You understand?
That's why you can't really hear anything, but you can feel what the slipper is feeling.
There's no sound.
No, you got to...
He's a...
I can't hear anything. he's a gentle lover.
There's no sound in there!
He's a gentle lover!
You're just there with the phone and there's no sound.
Hello.
You don't understand. Oh, hey.
Yeah, it's not so easy, is it?
Can't just snap your fingers and become a couple of Calvin Harrises-e-es.

Yeah. Shoo.
We got a song to write that's gonna give you the best damn aural you have ever had.

Jess: Reagan has a secret apartment.
Cece: A secret apartment?
Schmidt: Haberman.
Winston: What?!
I can't believe my girlfriend has a secret apartment!
I'm sure there's some explanation.
I can think of one of two things.
One, she's worried she's making a mistake by living with me.
Or two, and this one is way more realistic, she has a secret family.
Only men have secret families.
Look, just go talk to Reagan.
I can't just run into the bathroom shouting, "You have a secret apartment," Jess.
She'll bolt... to her secret apartment!
You talk to her.
Find out what the deal is.
No way I'm getting involved.
You leaked the intel to Cece.
You're deeper than any of us.
I was secretly recorded.
That is a felony, by the way.
This is between you and Reagan.
Jess, you've got to talk to her.
You've got to deal with this. She trusts you.
Please, you've got to help.

Hey...

Boo Boo?
Is this about the apartment?
Damn.
Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.
Whatever the explanation, it's okay.
I don't need to know anything except, like, when did you get it, is it, like, a real, genuine place, or is it, like, a playing it cool thing, like Nick's fake bar shift?
What?
What?
You said "fake bar shift," so does that mean that he didn't have to go to work, and that he lied to me?
Oh my God, you know who should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.
No. No.
Nick!
I don't want to talk to him...
Hey, Nick! Nick!
.... about anything.
Oh, weird.
I had no idea you were having a conversation [chuckling]: with Reagan right now.
We are in the middle of a conversation that we need to finish, so maybe we'll do that over drinks.
Did you have other plans?
Maybe you wanted to have a conversation with somebody.
Well, I'd love to finish our conversation, Jess, so maybe you and I should get a drink.
You know what? After last night, the only drink I can handle is... room temperature milk.
You guys got crazy?
Don't worry about it.
I just really would want to be able...
I would love to...
Nick: ... finish our conversation.
We started ours first, so we should finish ours earlier.
It's basic time science.
It's time science?
Yeah, it's time science.
You told me that you don't believe in watches or clocks, so I don't really think this is a very valid argument.
No, I said I believe in watches, I just don't trust who sets them.
Who sets the time?
You set the time.
Why would I set the time? It's my watch.
Okay, see? Talking is fun.
Why don't you guys continue this conversation... at the bar... by yourselves, without me?
I'll have a milk.
So in front of you, you have two songs, one by a recognized EDM "artist," quotes intended, the other is by me.

Why not just take that name literally, and you no fly?
Off to Seattle.
Wait, Nick! No! No!
I can't let you go! Your hair looks so stupid!
What?
You look like a total dork.
My hair looks stupid, I look like a total dork?
We can't let TSA see you like this.
But I've had this haircut for a little bit now.
I know.
You let me go to work, though?
It just looks particularly bad right this minute.
Then I'll just go like this.
How about now?
No. Mm-mm. Didn't fix it.
I get the impression you don't want me to go to Seattle.
That's because I don't want you to go to Seattle.
Well, why not?
I can't tell you.
I mean, I-is this about Reagan?
Do you not like her?
No, I like Reagan... she looks like the front of a ship come alive. Heh.
Is that why you've been acting so weird?
I haven't been acting weird.
You've been weird since the day I got back from New Orleans.
You're acting really squirrelly.
You don't think I've noticed, but I've noticed.
Okay, you're way off base.
I mean, what is it? I took your advice...
I'm gonna be with somebody who I find really special on Christmas.
Nick...
But, surprise, I've still done something wrong.
Don't go to Seattle. Trust me.
Why is nothing I do ever good enough for you?
What do you want from me?
I'm doing everything I can here!
Nick, I'm flying Reagan out from Seattle to surprise you.
I'm your Secret Santa, you jerk.
So this is what it feels like to be instantly sorry.
Schmidt: Where is everyone?
I thought this place would be crazy.
Ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, those were the days.
Now people prefer to shop online.
My grandfather opened this store.
Now it closes with me. So, to answer your question, yes, I do drink.
Um... hey, we're looking for a beanbag chair.
Hey! We have one.
Nice!
Heck, I'll go get it for you. I'm not doing anything.
Great, great.
Brick and mortar, baby.
[sighs]
A beanbag chair, Winston?
Yeah.
You thought that would be a... a suitable gift for my bride?
You wouldn't get it. I mean, it's a reference to a classic Winston-Cece mess-around.
Beanbag chair!
Never in my life have I heard of a game of one-on-one Pictionary.
We had a moment.
Unmoved.
Okay.
Had you drawn a picture poo-poo, would that have been a good gift for my Cece?
[laughing]: It would have been hilarious.
Look, Schmidt, I get it that you are closer to her than I am.
Uh-huh.
However, I got my own thing going on with her.
And I feel like you don't respect that.
Closer to her?
You are.
That's a good way to describe our relationship, comparatively to yours.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes, considering we are man and wife.
Yeah.
Winston, this is a very cozy, [sighs] inoffensive blanket.
Get it.
Has no relevance towards our relationship.
Why would I do that?
Get the blanket.
No.
Winston, please.
Just get the blanket and let's go.
Well, since you asked nicely, no.
Just get the blanket.
No. I don't want the damn blanket.
Here's the beanbag chair.
Yeah, stores are the best.
Hey, you guys want to go get lunch or something?
Nah. How much is it?
It's $249.99.
What? For a beanbag chair?
For a beanbag chair?
Well, we have a cheaper one... we're just, we're out of stock.
I could order it for you, but it would take seven to ten days.
Man, stores are the worst.
The admiral will take this.
Whatever happened to Hanukkah?
Hey, Jess, about that... the-the stuff I s...
Oh, wait, it's fine... I...
I must have seemed so crazy.
Let's just enjoy the holiday, okay?
Okay, Secret Santa.
By now, the suspense must be k*lling you.
As you all know, uh, Nick knows his Secret Santa gift is Reagan flying out from Seattle to surprise him.
All right.
Merry Christmas, Nick.
All right, Cece. That big boy's for you.
What in the hell is that?
Winston, what'd you do with the thing we just bought?
[gasps]
Beanbag chair!
Beanbag chair! It's from Winston!
Winston: They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.
Winston, you remembered our game night. I love it.
You do?
She does.
I do.
Well, you know what, Winston?
You were right... it's the perfect gift.
I guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that my wife is a little bit weirder than I thought she was.
It's a prototype, you know?
The real one's on its way.
Didn't have a lot of beans, so I had to pad it with rice and oatmeal.
It's a great gift. Thank you.
It's perfect!
Good job.
All right, well, whoever got Schmidt better have brought it, 'cause Winston set the bar really high.
Oh, here we go, here we go.
Here we go. Ooh...
Ooh...
Cashmere socks! Dayanu!
[chuckles]
Well, it's not Winston, it's not Jess.
Cece?
No. No, it's not me.
I got you, boy.
No way.
I got you. This is me.
This is you?
Nicholas! [laughs]
Yeah, come on.
I don't know why I'm finding the image of you mispronouncing the word "cashmere" in a store... to be so joyful.
"Cadsh-mer."
Winston.
Oh.
Ha-ha! I get one?
Oh, man.
Yeah. Everybody gets one.
That's crazy. I get one, too.
You know.
Yeah, everybody does.
Aah! For me?
Oh, my stars! A check made out to my phone company?
Cece, girl, is this for that night we got b*mb and called Iceland?
You know it is!
Okay, hold on, wait a minute, I had... I had Winston, too.
Somebody got left out. Who didn't get one?
Oh, Winnie got two gifts?
That's for Winston.
Yeah.
Oh... no, no, it's... it's fine.
It's... it's my fault.
I must have gotten so tipsy on Halloween, I forgot to write down my own name.
See? It's right there in the song.
He makes a list, he checks it twice.
See, this is probably why Santa stopped drinking.
Well, here, you know what?
Have this one.
Oh, my God, a hamster?!
You're a pet guy, man.
I am. I am.
But... Jess, you... you should have him.
No. I-I got the best gift of all.
Watching you guys give each other gifts that show you care.
Well, you can't not have a gift.
Besides, Ferguson's gonna eat him, anyway.
Oh. Well, if... if Ferguson will eat him, then I...
I'll take him.
Thanks, Winston.
Of course.
Great Secret Santa, everyone.
You want to go to bed, little guy?
You want to see your new room?
[sighs]
I feel horrible.
You have no idea. She and I got in a thing.
I said something so stupid.
[door opens]
Sleigh!
Others: Hey, Reagan.
Hey.
Really?
Do you know how hard it was to put this thing on in an airplane bathroom?
Do I.
If you don't get off that wheel right now, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Now!
Whoa. Did you understand me?
[door opens]
Oh, you're awa... you're awake. Great.
Nick, how often do you sneak into my room in the middle of the night?
Uh, that you're awake, uh, this is a first.
Here.
Weird.
Here's some cocoa.
Hey, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about what I said.
I know you are. Thanks.
I also want to say thank you.
Even though I knew Reagan was coming, when I saw her I felt like it was Christmas morning and I was ten.
But a ten-year-old about to have sex... with Santa!
And it was... yeah, this is getting weird.
Anyway, I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry and thank you.

So they call our names and we can't decide what song to sing.
I want to do Journey, of course.
And Jess wants to Adele.
Of course.
We can't decide.
Jess: Hail Mary... we decide to do The Doors!
And we bring the house...
[laughing]: down.
[grunts]
Oh, that's the end?
Yeah.
Riveting.
I like the story.
You know, The Doors?
Man, that's a nice white group.
Yeah, I love that you two are dating.
Well, Cece and I have moved on to a very different and more exciting chapter.
We'd like to invite all of you to a walkthrough of our new kitchen.
We have finally have walls.
Got the walls!
Wait, you're just getting walls now?
Who's building your house?
Congress? [laughs]
So relevant.
To the news of today.
Mm-hmm.
Truth be told, we've had some trouble with our contractor.
He's a real Joe Public.
Just a newspaper-and-dump kind of guy.
Robby, hey.
I haven't seen you at the marina.
Robby: Hey, Joan. I know. I haven't been sailing much since I broke most of my body and face.
Oh, you look good to me.
We should grab dinner.
Or breakfast.
Or both.
[Robby laughing]
Uh, I don't know.
But it's really great to see you so far inland.
Great to see you, too. [chuckles]
Keep it moving, Joan.
Your purse don't match your bangs.
Sorry about that, Jess.
Why are you sorry?
[mouth full]: The boat lady was h*t...
The boat lady was hitting on him.
Right in front of you.
So?
I don't own him.
He's not the box set of Felicity.
Question, because I'm invested.
Um, are you two exclusive?
Oh, well, we haven't had...
Well, I mean... a proper conversation about it.
Yeah, I don't think...
Jess: There's a whole...
This feels like a private conversation...
Shhhh!
Respectfully, I'd like to take it slow, you know?
'Cause I'm always diving into the deep end in relationships... and I'd kind of like to splash around the shallow end.
I get it. Let's just let this chicken marinate.
So, what are we looking at here?
Uh, open relationship?
Friends with benefits?
The old "dog and bone" situation?
We're just two people hanging out in a cool and modern way. [chuckles]
Welcome to the future.
What exactly is a "dog and bone" situation?
I'm assuming you-you're the bone...
You know damn well I was the bone!
Almost broke my neck.
I am terrified about what women have done to you, Winston.
We all got to get off, right?
We all got to get...
I'm gonna need you to leave.
I saw that coming.
♪ ♪
Ooh! Officer and a Gentlemen!
Yes. Nice.
Um, Die Hard 2!
I truly love pre-movie trivia.
Me, too, and I love seeing the local advertisements.
I like knowing who's hot in the teeth-whitening game.
[chuckles]
Also, Robby, I just want to say...
I'm really happy we're both on the same page about taking it slow.
I feel really great about it.
Me, too.
And, actually, I got a date this weekend.
[laughing]
Really?
With the boat lady?
Oh, no, it's a woman I work with at the factory, Babs.
You work in a factory?
Well, no, actually, um, I design them.
Oh, well, that's not fascinating at all. [chuckles]
That's fresh from the sarcasm factory, [laughs] 'cause it is fascinating.
Thought you would've mentioned that before.
You guys ask me surprisingly little about my personal life.
You're okay with this, right?
I mean, you wanted to see other people.
Yeah. Yeah, I definitely said that.
Yeah, I actually have a date, too.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
With who?
Shh, trailers are starting.
Okay, this way. Come on in.
Wait, so Robby has a date? That was so fast.
The man didn't waste any time.
But you know what? It's okay, 'cause I'm dating, too.
But you aren't, though. Your guy's fake.
Can we come back to Robby designing factories?
The man is an enigma.
He's my second best friend, and I know nothing about him.
Now, can we please focus?
We are doing a formal walkthrough.
Behold, the kitchen of tomorrow.
Where are the dang walls?!
Mr. Jason said one week at the latest.
No! No! No!
Uh, a minute alone with the boy?
Hey, bud.
Nick...
I am at my wit's end here.
Should I call the Better Business Bureau?
Better Business Bureau... that's not a real thing...
It's a very real thing... and as a man who co-owns a small business with you, I'm alarmed.
You just got to know how to talk to these people.
Schmidt: There's Mr. Jason over there.
See the brunette with his arms crossed?
Nick: Okay, let me take a cr*ck at this.
And don't call men brunettes.
We've talked about this before.
That's a nice grain.
Great grain.
Got to cut with the grain.
Uh, always.
Watch the fingers.
It's a living.
Get the hands dirty.
Yeah, you know, early bird gets the worm.
[laughs]
Clean your jeans.
Ask her what time it is, she'll tell you to build a watch, you know?
[both laugh]
Would you look at that?
It's good, though. It's good framing.
Ah, it's beautiful, stuff, yeah.
These guys are good.
You guys have done beautiful stuff.
Where does a modern girl go to make a fake guy real?
That is an insane combination of words.
It's not the Internet, a bar or a nightclub, 'cause I'm uncomfortable with all those.
You're taking a lot of options off the table.
And are you sure you're just not scared to get serious with Robby because you don't want to get hurt?
No, I'm not scared, I just... don't want to start a relationship with someone I barely know.
I mean, he has a boat.
What's next, a kid?
And then I have to meet the boat and the kid at some weird sea luncheon?
Honestly, playing the field sounds really exciting to me.
You know, going to strange places with strange men.
Sign me up for that.
You know, that certainly sounds like you, Jess.
You know what, you should just start right now.
There's a lot of guys here.
You should go and... talk to one.
At a construction site?
We... support it.
Jess: Okay, I can't tell if you're mocking me... but fine, I'll go have a look around.
Fine.
Fine.
I see what you did there.
Yeah, the quicker this plays out, the sooner she'll realize how ridiculous she's being.
Now, I'm not trying to break stones over here, but what can we do about these walls?
I can't do the walls until they do the electric, and I can't do the electric without my guy.
You got to have your guy, I get it, but what am I gonna do?
Jason: If I could I would, but I'm not Santa Claus. What do you want me to do?
What? Do I need to get your mother out here to do it?
'Cause I'll call your mother. I got her in my phone.
You're gonna call my mother?
Yeah, I'm gonna call your mother.
All right, you sack of crap.
[laughing]
I'll make a call.
Thank you.
All right.
Great!
What the hell was that?
Oh, he's gonna call his guy... he's gonna see what he can do about the walls.
Thank goodness. I thought it was gonna be a physical altercation.
Nah, he's a good guy, he's a good guy.
Salt of the earth.
It's more about what's unsaid, you know?
What it comes down to at the end of the day is respect.
And I have it for him and he has it for me.
Interesting.
So Mr. Jason doesn't respect me?
Oh, God, no.
Hmm.
I mean, Schmidt, I love you, but... but you're not a man of the people.
Of course I'm not a man of the people... I'm above the people.
I want the people to build things for me.
And that's where I come in.
I can't rely on your... crass Chicago street smarts forever.
I'm a homeowner, and I'm a husband, and hopefully, one day I'll be a father.
If he's not gonna respect me, then I need to become someone that he will.
That sounds a little scary.
Who-who are you looking to become, Schmidt?
You.
Ugh.
Anyway, if any of you gentlemen are looking for something modern and non-exclusive...
You got a nail in your ass.
Oh. Um, that's not my ass, that's actually my dress. [groans]
Could one of you guys help me?
No, we're busy right now.
Come on.
Oh. Thank you...
Es good?
Es very good. [chuckles]
Mm! So, how's Babs?
Is she puttin' out?
[both laughs]
Well, she's great. I-I haven't gone out with her yet, but I look forward to getting to know her in a relaxed and modern way.
Great.
I'm ready to tell you about my guy now.
His name is Stavros, and he is Greek, which is exciting.
That's... very exciting.
Yeah...
He sounds... sounds very sexy.
I can't believe she met a man at a construction site.
I mean, I'm kind of impressed.
He thinks it's really funny how big our drinks are.
They are big.
I'm concerned Robby doesn't care.
They're testing each other.
Look at his bottom lip.
Stavros is taking me to a club on Friday.
Ah. Yeah... okay. I get it. He cares.
Okay, uh... we were supposed to go out on Friday.
Oh! I'm sorry. You know what?
Should I cancel?
No. It's okay.
I'll just go out on Friday with Babs.
Sounds fun.
It's gonna be fun.
Or... crazy idea.
What if we all hang out together?
Very interesting. Like a double date?
That seems precarious.
Oh, it's totally just gonna blow up in their faces, and they're gonna need us when it does, so we should probably be on call.
Absolutely. Yeah.
We're a very important part of this.
What'd I tell you? They're putting the electrical in.
Ta-da!
Don't say ta-da around these guys.
And why are you wearing my clothes?
I'm you.
You are making this way creepier than it needs to be.
But let's work on your stance, okay?
Okay.
You're gonna want to adjust your pants a lot, like watch me.
Like this. Just like looking around, checking it out, adjust your pants; try it.
Just do it normal, just do it normal.
Don't make that face.
Regular face.
If you're gonna do anything with your shoulders, it's this.
Just relax...
No. You're doing this...
Don't do that here. It's like this...
Okay, let's try something else.
I think you-you need to slouch a little bit, 'cause all these people have back pain.
Look, I'm sorry that I have good posture.
I'm not on my hands and knees all day slapping hot tar on a roof.
I'm sitting in an ergonomic office chair like a frickin' gentleman.
So, here's a way to give a compliment.
It's... you insult somebody, that's a way to show affection.
Like, hey, you ugly piece of crap, you got humongous ears.
So you're too insecure to show affection, so you do the opposite.
And if you're ever in a pinch, and the moment's getting on top of you, just mention the game.
[whispering]: You got this, man.
You got this.
Hey, what's up dum-dum?
I'm sorry, I was breaking so much b*lls before.
I had a really stressful day at the office.
You know, the, uh, boss was really giving it to me, so I kicked his ass, but I'm better.
Hey, uh, I know how it goes, bud.
So now that we have the electrical, maybe we can get started on the walls?
Wh-what do you say, bud?
Oh, uh, we're gonna have to wait on the inspection.
And that could take a few months.
A few months?!
Any way we could speed this process along?
What do you say, you dirty slut?
Slut?
Look, this a city issue.
But we could, uh, throw a little money at the situation.
See what we see.
Throw a little bit of money, see what we see.
Who do I make the check out to? Los Angeles?
Or ma-make it to cash.
There you go.
Yeah. All right.
Now we're talking. Ow!
Caught a little bit of my ween in there.
You all right?
Just the tip, just the tip of the ween.
Okay.
Jess: Wow.
Your house is amazing.
Who lives here, Vin Diesel?
No. But we do share a gardener.
This is Stavros.
He brought homemade wine.
Thank you, Stavros. Looks, uh, very fresh.
[Stavros speaking Greek]
Is that right?
Does he speak English?
No. But his last name has 17 consonants, which I find very charming.
Sure.
So where's Babs?
Putting her grandkids to bed?
[chuckles]
Hey.
[gasps]
I'm Babs.
[chuckling]: This is gonna be fun.
To life!
This bottle's very warm.
So, Babs, um, you work at the factory with Robby?
I'm the head engineer.
Robby: Babs is a genius physicist.
She got her doctorate from Cambridge.
Wow. I didn't...
I mean, that's very impressive.
Stavros is from a rich tradition of, uh, craftsman.
Without men like him, we wouldn't have houses to live in, or delicious wine to drink with friends.
[chuckling]: Salud.
Salud.
Yamas.
[all gagging, except Stavros]
[choking]: Oh... it burns.
Es good?
Es good.
Es good?
It's good.
Is that a gold record on your wall?
Robby: Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I-I played bass on a Santana album.
Who are you?
Yeah, there's... there's no updates yet.
I wonder how it's going.
Mm, mm, mm.
Waiter has my credit card, in case we need to leave, we're ready.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, let me ask you something.
You think we're too involved in Robby and Jess?
It could be argued that this is a little unhealthy.
Mm.
What does it really say about us, you know?
Are we just so bored with our own lives now that we're settled and in love?
Nah, that's not what's happening here, okay? [laughs]
We're not bored.
Right.
All right. I got a lot of stuff going on.
Yeah.
Whoo-ho.
Let me start from the top.
Okay.
Let me tell you, last week?
Yeah.
I had ants in my room.
Yeah. What else, what else, what else, what else?
Ooh, I think I'm gonna try the crab breast.
Did it.
Sure did.
You know what's crazy?
Not only did I get Mr. Jason to respect me, but I think I learned to respect him a little bit, too.
I like the people; so wild and lazy.
If you want, I could take you to the store I get my jeans.
It's actually just a Mexican supermarket.
Give it to me.
I got it.
Give it to me...
You okay?
Give it to me.
Look at the suds.
You ruined a beer.
Schmidt: Ah, there he is.
Hey-o. Working late.
So, Mr. Jason, did we get the inspection, or are we gonna keep waiting around like a couple of jamooks?
Eh, threw some sawdust on the puddle, but it's still wet.
I don't know... is that a bad thing or good thing?
Means he didn't get it.
Hey, blame the city.
I hate the city!
Stup-stupid city.
Well, you know what, Mr. Jason? You tried.
Thank you for that.
I guess you can just give us our money back.
Oh, I don't have your money.
We didn't get the inspection, though.
Well, I said we'd see what we see.
And this is what we saw...
You get it.
I don't think that I do get it. Do we get it, Nick?
Do I, do I... I don't get it.
Do you get it?
I get it.
Aren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?
These are extra.
I'm gonna use them on another job.
Nick: Oh, at another job.
Oh, it... and he left with them.
What does he do? I don't understand...
What's happening? What is happening?
Oh, I get it. I get it.
We got ripped off.
God... I knew it.
How did I not see this coming?
Maybe I've lost touch with the people.
Serves me right being such a damn success.
I'm sitting in my ivory tower like Dan Brown!
Nick, you're a very talented writer, but you're no Dan Brown.
You've never even had anything published.
Well, if I'm no Dan Brown, and I'm no man of the people, then who am I?
Stop having an identity crisis! Now is not the time.
What we need to do is come up with a plan that combines both of our strengths.
I like this.
Here's what I'm thinking.
We invite Mr. Jason over for the game.
And while I'm hosting the hell out of him, you sneak down, and you steal those pipes out of his truck.
Let's do this, man! Let's do this!
Nobody rips us off.
Nobody rips us off!
Let's do it!
I think what you wanted to do was more like that.
Why didn't mine break?
It's really easy to break it, you just...
[grunting]
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
Choiros. Choiros chrimata!
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Choiros chrimata!
What does that mean?
I think, I think he's saying "pig money." Is it pig money?
Time!
[laughter]
Well, it was piggy bank, which is close enough.
We gave you "garbanzos" for "chick peas."
I'm afraid we cannot allow it, Jess.
Man, we are wrecking you guys.
It's probably 'cause me and Babs have, uh, such a strong connection.
Whatever. It's just 'cause you speak the same language.
I like to date people that I can communicate with.
Good for you. Where's the wine?
I like it now.
I think it's making me hallucinate.
Mm-hmm. Me, too.
You know what? It's of good quality.

This is a weird night.
Well, welcome to my world, Babs.
Jess, you don't know what you want.
I mean, do you like me? Do you not like me?
Are we in a relationship? Are we not?
[singing in Greek]
Thank you, Stavros. That'll do.
I'm gonna go.
[groans slightly]
Yeah, well... I think we should all go.
[groans]
Stavros, thank you for the psychedelic wine, but I would like you to leave my house now so that I can throw up.
Jess, we go disco?
♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ♪
♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ♪
♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz... ♪
Maybe our lives are boring.
Mm-hmm.
Or... are we just happy?
Follow me on this one.
Okay.
Would you want to be dating still?
Hell, no.
Thank you.
I am happy!
You know, and happy... sometimes it's a little bit boring, but, you know, I have a great marriage.
And who needs the drama? No.
Not me.
As of right now, I am washing my hands of all this Jess and Robby nonsense.
I feel you.
I'm out!
Jess just texted. She needs us.
I'm in! Let's go!
We're in!
Okay, that slime ball is on his way.
Are you wearing my jeans?
Yeah. I'm all mixed up, and I can't get 'em off.
Well, that's 'cause they fit. They look fantastic.
If you get 'em wet, I'm gonna flip out.
[knocking]
Let's do this.
Hey, hey, big game for the boys, huh?
Big games for the boys is right. Mr. Jason, come on in.
Ah. Nice.
Have a seat.
Nick, uh, want to go take care of that thing?
Oh, yeah, I got to fix the boiler.
Oh, gas or steam?
Double?
It's a, it's a double. It sure is a double.
Mr. Jason, it's good to see you!
Thank you so much for having me over. This is gonna be a good game.
Are you hungry? We've got some food.
I've got sausages and brats, all the sports meats.
You know, I don't eat meat. I'm a vegan.
You...
[loud metallic clinking and clanking]
[loud metallic clanking]
[Nick grunts]
[Nick grunts]
Hey!
It's not what it looks like, Mr. Jason!
It must be hard to order as a vegan in a restaurant.
Oh!
[indistinct chatter]
[whoops]
What is happening?
What are we doing here?
How was the date? Tell us everything.
Babs was a real catch, I drank too much hallucinogenic wine, um, screwed everything up with Robby, and now I'm at a... Greek rave.
There's a rotisserie in the back if you're hungry.
Honey, what is this about?
Are you really that scared of getting hurt?
I'm not afraid of how it's gonna end.
I'm afraid of how it started.
Like, I've been so hesitant from the beginning.
Like, I need to be convinced.
Just, there's no love story called Hemming and Hawing.
Winston: Actually, there is.
Jose Canseco self-published it on the Internet.
It's about a lamb that marries a CEO.
Cece: Jess, I think you should be having this conversation with Robby.
Or maybe I need to be having this conversation with Robby!
How much wine have you had to drink?
I don't know.
It was in a soda bottle. Look, don't stop me.
I'm gonna go find Robby!
[Winston whistles]
Uh...
Robby: Hi, uh, I'm looking for a girl named Jess!
She wears glasses. Kind of like this?
I know that's not a lot to go on, but the glasses are, like, her-her whole thing really.
He's here, he's here!
Robby?!
Hey!
Cece! Winston!
Hey!
I'm looking for Jess.
Well, she's looking for you.
Yeah, she's looking for you.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's...
Yeah, she's about to leave.
I want to get out of this joint!
What's Greek for exit?
Jess?!
Oh. Hi.
Jess!
Robby!
I don't want to see other people.
And also, I'm eating a falafel 'cause I'm-I'm really, really drunk.
I'm really drunk, too, and I don't want to see anyone else, either.
Jess: We just got off to such a rough start.
I don't care how it started. I just care where it goes.
I like you.
I like you, too!
You're stealing my pipes?! Unbelievable!
You are breaking my b*lls into oblivion!
You broke my b*lls first. I got a scrotum full of whipped cream.
Oh!
You stole our money, man!
I told you, I tried to get the permit.
It didn't work out.
You got screwed over, but I didn't do it.
Then why did you take my pipes?
I bought 'em back to use at another job.
It's in your invoice!
I actually saved you money!
If that's true, I am so thankful.
That's really nice of you, Mr. Jason.
Yeah, great job.
Thank you.
You're really good contractor then.
Mr. Jason?
Are you... are you crying?
It's not easy being a contractor.
I'm always the bad guy.
I just want to build other people's dreams.
Well, I feel like a buffoon.
You know what, Mr. Jason? We misjudged you.
Big time.
And ourselves.
If we hadn't been so hung up on labels, we would've been able to see each other for who we are.
You're Mr. Jason.
Call me Jason. What's with the Mr. Jason?
You're a vegan.
Get out.
You know, it takes 53 gallons of water to produce a single chicken egg?
That's why!
Great!
What do you say we hug it out?
All right.
Oh, there you go.
There you go.
There you go, Mr. Jason.
I don't usually do this.
[patting Mr. Jason rhythmically]
It's nice.
Yeah, it's nice.
All right.
Oh, that's a tight squeeze.
Oh, boy. Ooh, what a grip.
Can't breathe You weren't actually in Santana.
You just met the band when you were delivering pizza to the studio?
Carlos found out that I played bass somehow, and then he asked me to sit in.
Huh.
Thus began the brief career I had as a studio session musician when I was a junior in high school.
I managed the girls JV wrestling team.
That's really cool, too.
It was cool.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, tell me literally everything that's ever happened to you.
You should just watch the PBS special.
What?!
ROBBY: I saved a guy's life.
Jess: What? Whose life?
Do you know who Elon Musk is?
Babe, can you help me finish this thank you card to Asha Auntie?
She got us... that.
Schmidt: That porpoise p*rn?
Yeah.
"Best, comma, Cece and Schimdt."
All we're gonna give her is a "Best, comma"?
Come on, she's my mom's sister.
Well, she should have stuck to the registry.
You know who hasn't even gotten us a present yet?
I have a year.
He has a year.
I have a year!
[door closes]
All right, everyone.
Report to the principal's office, where I will be sitting behind the desk because...
I might be principal!
Congrats!
That's great!
What do you mean, could be principal?
Well, I just had a very interesting talk with my boss, Genevieve.
Jess, I am dying.
What? Oh, my God!
Dying to leave Banyon Canyon and launch my own elementary school at sea.
Oh. You scared the bejesus out of me.
I've wanted this forever and I came so close at my last school.
Like, champagne and Prosecco close.
So, if you find marijuana in a locker, it's yours now.
Ours now. It could just be part of the loft.
We could just put it in a...
Congratulations.
You just got yourself two weeks detention, Mr. Miller.
What? But I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
[sighs]
♪ ♪
Principal, that's great. I'm really proud of you.
And now you're almost gonna make what normal people make.
But I'm not even in it for the cabbage.
I want to change lives.
And finally, I can implement some of my programs school-wide, like the math decathlon... the demathlon.
A-ha!
[Winston laughing]
You see this whole time, y'all thought you were having breakfast with Winston, but it turns out y'all been sitting with James Wonder.
I'm talking about my alias.
See, I'm thinking about applying for undercover work.
That sounds incredibly dangerous.
Well, not if I go deep enough into my undercover character.
I've been practicing on y'all unknowin' asses.
I combined the names of my favorite singers...
Stevie Wonder and James Blunt.
And I put those together to create a different name as my alias, James Wonder.
I'm worried you're not the undercover type of guy.
I feel like if you had the ability to pretend to be someone else, you would have made that decision a long time ago.
I feel like that sounded harsh, but it's only 'cause I care about you.
Jess: I love Parents' Day!
Matching names to e-mail addresses, puttin' big people in little chairs.
Admiring all that sweet daddy derriere.
Yeah, I'm not doing that.
Good. More for me.
Ooh. That is Ed Warner.
President of the parent's council.
You're gonna need his vote if you want to become principal, so...
Okay, did you talk me up?
Absolutely not.
School politics gets messy and as my grandmother used to say, "You don't get dirty till after 6:30."
Piece of cake. Parents love me.
Ed!
Oh, are-are you okay?
[chuckling]: Sorry, I was, uh, moved to tears by the... second grader's self-portraits.
I cannot believe you are gonna abandon us next year.
Oh...
I'm like, "Ah, don't go!"
[imitating Genevieve]: I can keep the accent so you'll barely notice she's gone.
[chuckles awkwardly]
Prince Henry, pet me corgi.
Wow.
Um, Ed, have you met our vice principal?
Jessica Day. I'm a big fan of your work and by your work, I mean the child you created.
Not to suggest that it was work making her.
I'm sure it was fun.
I mean... I hope it was fun.
Ed, if you're gonna ask me sex advice, please buy me a glass of wine first.
[Jess chuckles]
[clears throat]
Anyway, switching gears.
I'd love to discuss the, uh, principal vacancy.
As would I.
N-not now. Now's not a great time.
I have, um, uh...
Goodbye.
You beefed it, love.
You beefed it hard.
[blender whirring]
Is that the Vitalstir 3,000 from my registry?
Oh, no, I've had...
I've had this forever.
It came out last year.
Did it?
I've had it for a year.
No, I'm just doing what I always do.
Nicky Miller makin', uh, his famous guacamole.
Like I always do.
Nick Miller's famous guacamole.
[blender whirring]
See ya later.
I'll call you when it's done!
Fine.
[blender stops]
It's from your registry.
I bought it, I brought it home but I can't give it to you.
I am freaking out about what to get you.
Well, Nick why don't you just give us this blender that's on the list of stuff that I want?
Because I feel trapped by this registry.
It's a list made by robots.
Nick, not everything is robots!
Winston puts one walkie-talkie into a mailbox...
Robotic voice: Thank you for your letter.
Yum!
[laughing quietly]
I just... you guys are like my family.
I want to get you something great.
Something unique, personal.
Oh, Nick.
And while you clearly don't understand what a registry is...
[sighs]
I appreciate the sentiment.
Nick...
I don't say this lightly...
I release you from the registry.
Great.
Buy us a gift of your choosing.
What-what I want to get you.
Whatever you want.
The world is yours.
Fly, my little hummingbird.
'Cause I can get you anything.
Oh... this was a double-edged coin.
Winston: Excuse me?
Can you tell me where I can find my son's cubby?
Winston! What are you doing here?
And before you answer that question, get out of here!
Winston? Can't you read?
You said I couldn't do it, but I did it.
I am deep undercover right now.
No one's gonna believe you're a parent here.
Ed: Jimmy-dubs!
Where'd you go?
I needed a refill on the java, E-dawg.
[chuckles]
Jess: Oh, my goodness!
I see you've already met and also, already have '90s hip-hop nicknames for each other.
Genevieve, this is James Wonder.
Hey.
A potential new dad.
He's a landscape architect.
Oh....
And father of Asher.
And husband of?
I... I'm a widower.
Oh, oh...
Yeah. Yeah, she, um... she got squished.
Squished?
Mm-hmm.
Did she? Did she?
Okay, James. Uh, let's leave now so I can show you the school's landscaping.
Ed: Wait, actually, I have a stubborn back yard.
Uh, I don't want to bring in frogs, but if I could attract frogs...
Very common situation in our business.
You need a well.
A well?
Oh. Well, you need to let me buy you a bottle of wine and pick your brain about all this.
[laughs]
That sounds good, E-dawg. We should...
But... but right now, I should get going.
Yeah.
I got a butt load of koi fish in the back of my truck that need bonding.
Please, let me show you out.
Take my hand. Oh, God. Did I say breast?
I meant... I meant hand.
Jess: Uh, hey. Hey, Ed.
I'd love to circle back around to that principal conversation.
Let me just stop you there, Miss Day.
Um, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think I speak for every parent at Banyon Canyon when I say, you're just not a good fit.
Wh-what? I am a perfect fit.
I have my reasons. [chuckles]
Excuse me, I have, uh...
[smacks lips]
Good-bye.
I'm making this for Genevieve. I'm...
I gotta convince her to make my case to Ed.
My man, Ed.
Listen Jess, I could go ahead and give him a call if you like.
All you have to do is say the word.
No, no, no, no. This is no country for James Wonder.
I'm not having you go undercover at school again.
No offense, but you kind of fell out of your dress when Genevieve came on to you.
I did get rattled. I have a girlfriend, and I adore Ally.
But everything else I'm doing seems to be working because Ed loves me.
You know, he wants James to landscape his yard.
So I drew him four sketches.
Wow. Winston, these are actually really good.
I don't remember drawing these.
I woke up this morning, and they were under my pillow.
[groans]
Hey, Nick...
Would you be interested in rubble from old Yankee Stadium?
What, for my rubble collection?
I'm having a really hard time finding something for you.
I thought I was just gonna go on the Internet, but the Internet is so different now.
Have you been on the Internet lately?
How drunk are you?
I remember when the Internet used to just be a naked lady and a bunch of dancing hamsters.
How drunk are you, Nick?
I literally haven't had one thing to drink.
How many drinks have you had?
Give me a breathalyzer.
It feels like you're drunk.
Z-Y-X-N-L-P-A.
You're hammered.
I'm drunk.
Nick, whatever you get us, we're going to love.
It... it doesn't matter.
I don't know what to get you, and it matters, it matters!
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter!
Just get us something!
[shouting]: There's a registry.
You go on it, and you pick something!
Now you've got Schmidt all cranked up.
You're cranked up?
Yeah, I got to go to the arcade now and blow off steam!
I didn't mean to crank you up.
Hey, Cece.
Hey, hey.
I don't know what to do.
I want to get you something great, but I can't find anything on the Internet.
Here's the truth. I'd give you my heart.
I'd rip it out of my chest but... but then I would literally die.
But you know that, you're studying to be a nurse.
No, I'm not.
You're already a nurse?
Not a nurse.
But you went to college didn't you?
Why didn't you just give us the Vitalstir?
Because then it would just end up in a landfill in a year when they come out with a Vitalstir 3001.
Well, I imagine they'd go to 4000.
Do you think that they have made 3,000 different Vitalstir models?
Do you really think they've perfected this blender in four tries?
You're not a nurse. [laughs]
Look, I know what you're struggling with right now, okay?
You want to get us something that's unique.
It's got to be great. It's got to be from me to you.
Alright, here's a little exercise... close your eyes.
Now, first thing that comes to your mind.
Imagine something that is unique, it's permanent.
I got it!
Okay, you got to open your eyes before you go, you drunk.
Let me give you the, uh, keys so you can close up.
Oh, no. I put two hands in at the same time again.
[straining]
I did it again.
I can't find this James Wonder anywhere.
I just wanted to say hi, and I want to send him a password-protected video I thought he might enjoy.
Well, I just brought you a little gift.
I know what you're doing. Jess, I have told you I can't afford to get involved in school politics.
Please, Genevieve. I'm begging you.
There's no delicate way to say this so I'm going to be... incredibly cruel.
They don't like you.
At all.
Ow.
They despise you.
All right. I got it.
"Get rid of Jess."
Yikes.
These aren't my words, Jess.
I'm just repeating what I'm hearing.
"Jess is the worst."
Okay.
"Can't stand the sight of her."
Don't need all of it.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Yeah.
They've asked me to move on with my search.
Wait a minute.
Huh?
Would you talk me up to Ed if I could tell you where he was having dinner?
With James Wonder?
Winston.
You need to say the words, Jess.
I need your help.
I need your help, who?
I need your help, James Wonder.
Well, then, my help you shall have.
What'd he say? Is he going to help?
Here is your mission.
You're going too down to Brickfield and you're going to facilitate a conversation about me... with Ed...
My man.
... and Genevieve.
I'm out.
Please, Winst...
James Wonder.
She wants to have sex with me.
I know you love Ally, but James Wonder is still grieving.
Lean into the character.
This is your chance to prove that you can do undercover work.
Please?
All right, I'll do it. Under one condition.
That I...
No, I don't have any conditions.
Okay.
I design all the landscaping, and my crew... my crew, they do all the dirty work.
If you were my boss I would be employee of the month every single day.
Winston [over phone speaker]: All right then.
Oh, jeez, Genevieve, stop flirting, get to me!
Are you shouting at a podcast again, Jess?
You know it can't hear you, right?
Shh!
Speaking of bosses, Ms. Day has done some amazing work.
Strong disagree.
Uh, what is your ish with her?
She sets our kids up for failure.
What?!
Ed: This ridiculous... math decathlon... ugh!
It is competitive and demeaning.
It is hard enough out there for these kids.
Affluent children in Los Angeles do have it hard.
Exactly.
Samanthia b*mb that dumb thing, never got a medal, and now she's lost her appetite for soosh!
That's what he's mad at?
My version of the demathlon is way less rigorous than the South Korean teacher I copied it from.
Either bring the phone over here where we can hear it, or stop talking to it.
He's saying that unless I drop the demathlon, I'll never be principal.
Genevieve: James.
I am trouble after two glasses.
So why don't you pour me a third?
[laughing heartily]
[nervous chuckle]
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
Okay. Mm-hmm. O-okay.
Do it. Do it!
Okay. Okay.
[laughing]
Stop it! Stop it!
I'm going to get crazy.
You're making me crazy.
I did it.
Best present ever.
Please. I'm trying to eavesdrop on Winston's alter ego.
[chuckling] Oh...
Genevieve: James.
Hmm?
You seem troubled.
No, I don't.
You must be holding a lot of sadness in your legs.
I have hands like a bonobo... strong.
Oh, wow. [nervous chuckle]
There we go.
Ooh. Very good.
Aah!
Ow! Now, no! I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Ally.
No. No. No. No. No.
Wasn't your wife recently squished?
Yeah. That-that happened.
She was indeed...
But then, we cremated her.
And we, we, we had to dry her out first.
Ugh. He's scrambling like a damn egg!
I got to get in there.
Wait, you got to see my gift!
Who are you, James Wonder?
[chuckles]
I'm just a... a combination of my two favorite singers.
I'm about to gift your brains to pieces.
You got to real pull-the-rip-cord-while-still-in-the-plane kind of vibe, Nick.
It's a little something from me... to you.
All right.
Or, more accurately, on me.
[laughing] Check it out.
I got the best gift.
It is your faces, but it's not your bodies.
I didn't have a full body sh*t so...
Wow!
.. they picked the bodies.
Schmidt: Is that Pretty Woman?
This is from the movie Pretty Woman and it's on me forever.
[laughs]
Say something.
[nervous chuckle]
Say something.
It-it's cute, it's really cute.
I really did it.
Talk to me about how happy you are.
It's on me forever.
Schmidt: I know we're on you forever and ever, until you're buried in a non-Jewish cemetery.
Cece: And now we-we owe you a... a thank you card.
Just don't know where I'm gonna find the words to express all of the emotions that I'm feeling right now.
[laughs]
I can't find anything about you online, James.
Not even the darknet.
Oh, I was gonna say, you checked the darknet, yeah?
I'm usually on there, they usually got some stuff about me.
Hey!
Winston: Oh, thank God. Jess... ica Day.
I can't believe you guys are all at my favorite restaurant.
Hey, does anyone have a red landscaping truck?
'Cause it's getting towed.
Anyone? Red landscaping truck?
No, mine's white.
[clears throat]
Well, it could be white.
It's getting towed.
I-I did take the red one today.
Yeah, can't let that get towed.
My crew is napping in the back.
Yup.
Well...
[chuckling]: Hey.
This is an unexpected treat.
Well, I'm happy to have ran into you because, um...
I've been thinking, and...
I'm canceling the demathlon.
Really?
Yeah.
But I thought you loved the math decathlon?
It's a holdover from my old public school days.
It's unnecessarily competitive.
Old habits die hard.
That's true, you know, I still eat a ton of meat and I've been vegetarian for years.
Like, a ton.
A ton of meat.
I mean, I didn't realize you were so amenable.
Hey, actually, Samanthia loves puppets.
What would you say if I asked you to introduce ventriloquism into the curriculum?
And do less math?
I'd say...
[in puppet voice]: You got it!
[clears throat]
Great.
[both chuckle]
"Sincerely"?
"Sincerely"?
"Dear Nick, thanks for the tattoo.
"Sincerely, S and Cece."
You guys hate my gift?
No, we don't hate it, we love it, I see it every time I blink.
You guys want to see it?
It's okay.
Ah, I'll show it anyhow.
Check it out. There's an ingrown hair that gives Cece a bit of a Rudolph nose.
And when I flex my feet it makes you guys fatter. Look.
Fat, look how fat your face looks, Schmidt.
[laughs] You have the fattest face in the world.
All right, stop it! Stop the horror!
We hate the gift.
It's disgusting.
It is disgusting.
You've ruined your leg.
It is like you stole our souls.
You depicted my wife as a common street whore.
Fine, you don't want it?
You can't have it.
I'll get it removed and we can go about our lives again in a week.
You know it costs, like, two grand and takes a year or something, right?
Well, I did not know that.
Okay?
I didn't know that.
Well, that really sucks for me.
But fine, then that's your present.
That's not a present. Look Nick, I appreciate you trying to do something meaningful for us, but just give us the blender you bought.
Well, the jokes on you, I burnt out the motor making a bubble gum smoothie.
You're back on the registry then.
I won't do it! It's a list made by robots.
Idiot! Trying to get me something meaningful!
The only thing meaningful to me is the blender!
Remember to bring your pets to school next week for human zoo day.
Yeah.
Oh, and I'd also like to let everyone know that we are switching back from this soap to this soap, okay?
So just be aware.
Next, I would like to offer my personal endorsement of Jessica Day as our next principal.
[applause]
All right, well, first, I'd love to open up the floor to questions. Anybody?
Oh, wow, okay.
Can you get rid of the white lines in the parking lot?
They're very restrictive.
I think they're for...
Man 2: Shouldn't we designate the green space for European-style football?
Woman: And for Tofu Tuesday, can we get a more balanced juice pairing?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I came to say goodbye.
Asher and I are moving to Colorado.
Is that where Ally lives?
No.
The city of Denver wants me to landscape an entire mountain.
It's a whole thing.
Man 1: How about once a week in the dining hall we serve sushi omakase?
Oh, oh, okay.
Ed: Guys, uh, plenty of time to run our suggestions by her.
But I assure you she will be very amenable.
She is a principal for the parents.
Hmm?
Uh, actually, um, no.
I-I have to be honest here.
I...
That's not who I am.
I'm not gonna be a principal for the parents.
[parents murmur]
I'm gonna be a principal for the kids.
Look, you all love your kids and they're yours to raise, but I'm an educator and I know how to educate.
Colby, your son Vince had the handwriting of a Hungarian doctor.
Mm-hmm.
And that's why I encouraged him to sign up for calligraphy comics after school.
He didn't want to do it, but look at him now.
I can finally read the captions for his disturbing images.
And Molly, do you remember how terrified Beatrice was of public speaking in the second grade?
That's why I bumped her up to fourth grade debate team.
Yeah, she made a toast at my brother's wedding.
I mean, besides one r*cist joke, she k*lled.
Ed, when I met Samanthia, math was her least favorite subject.
Now she's doing fractions and loving it.
And yeah, she's didn't win a demathlon medal and I know that stung, but it made her want to get better.
And isn't that what school is for?
Look, I think challenging your children prepares them for the real world.
And if given the chance, I think I can help your kids and this school reach its full potential.
And if that's not what you want, and I'm not the right fit, then I can live with that.

You know, it was weird this morning in the shower... just me and tattoo you.
I was the only one who was naked You know, we could loan you the money to remove it.
I don't like debts. [groaning]
All finished, guys.
Glad we all talked ourselves into thinking that this somehow makes the nightmare better.
Nick, I just want to say...
I really think...
I'm not getting a damn cat on my leg.
Drop it.
Welcome to the ceremonial lighting of the first burner.
Come on, Susan!
There it is!
[Cece gasps]
Aah!
Thanksgiving!
It is 7:00 A.M.
I've actually been up for two hours.
Let's do this! Perfect Thanksgiving!
Reagan's coming today, and I want everything to be great for the guest of honor.
Oh, the... the guest of honor?
Yeah, the guest of honor.
I guess my dad spending Thanksgiving with me for the first time ever is a non-event.
Ooh. Is he bringing his new squoosh?
Hmm?
Is that a thing people say?
No.
Uh-uh.
Well, his squoosh has a name, and it's Ann Kim.
She's probably gonna want to spend some time with you ladies, too, because you know how fathers and sons can be on Thanksgiving.
Drinking beer, watching the game, hugging each other in a way that suggests, "I forgive you for every... for everything."
Okay, look, I know you're excited, but maybe don't put so much pressure on it, you know?
I mean, we all... we all know who your dad is.
Who he was. Who he was, though.
Just don't expect too much.
Just be happy that he's coming at all.
So what time's Robby coming?
He's not coming.
He is going to visit his folks.
What's your guys' deal now?
Are you actually together, or are you just nursing him back to health 'cause you broke his entire body and face?
We are not together, but I don't think Robby understands that.
I wonder why, Jess.
You only hang out with him 24/7.
♪ Come on, baby, make it hurt so... ♪
[screaming]
I feel mean telling him we're not dating when he's in this state.
Cece: It is a lot meaner to lead him on, okay?
You got to drop the hammer.
I know. You're right.
I'll do it next time I see him. I'm just dreading it.
He's such a good egg.
I mean, with his dad khakis and his glasses and his... his... his sweet little change purse.
You know what? That's it. He's too nice.
There's just no oomph.
Yeah. It's non-negotiable. You got to have the oomph.
Yeah, oomph was all Cece and I had when we started oomphing.
Oh, "oomph" is sex.
Why say that stupid word? Just say "sex."
Oh, because it's more than that, Nick.
It's f*re. It's passion.
It's ha-cha-cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
Mm.
Jess: And there's no ha-cha-cha with Robby. He's too nice.
Winston: Well, look, Jess, do what you got to, but I love that guy.
Robby was there for me when I got hurt in the line of duty.
[groaning]
Schmidt: Winston, you sprained your ankle running for a bagel.
Yeah. I was at work, though.
Running for a bagel.
Look, Robby's the only one who understands my pain.
Well, nothing makes me happier than cooking for ten hours and eating in under 25 minutes. Chant me in.
All [chanting]: Stuff that bird!
Stuff that bird! Stuff that bird!
Guess who's too injured to fly?
Is it you?
♪ ♪
Jess: Don't get me wrong. I mean, I feel...
I feel like I'm holding the long end of the wishbone right now, but, um, why wouldn't they let you on the plane?
There was a fit issue.
[groans] I'm sorry. All right. I'm so sorry.
[screams] Oh! Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Whoa. Whoa.
[screams] Aah! No, no, no, it's fine.
Oh! Oh!
Well, at least you had the fun of going to the airport on Thanksgiving.
And I get to hang out with you.
[indistinct chatter on TV]
Yay! And boo!
Because I already have plans with a 15-pound cutie. [laughs]
I'm talking about the turkey.
[laughs]
Listen, I'm gonna plant you in front of the parade, and you're gonna yell out what balloons go by!
Okay. Okay.
Man [on TV]: The start of the parade just...
[laughs]
With the speed?! He like Mayweather with the Kn*fe!
Cece: Okay, what is going on?
Because you don't even use a Kn*fe to eat a steak?
Well, my girl is coming. Of course my hands are dancing.
These knives are a part of me like that, uh, scissor hand guy.
What is his name again? Is it Rick Snip?
Did you drop the hammer?
I have not dropped the hammer.
Snoopy! Saw Snoopy.
Okay, no. You-you got to end this.
Robby: False alarm. It's just John Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.
Drop the hammer now?
He can't even tell the difference between John Stamos and Snoopy.
You can't break a man's heart on a holiday.
I'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain... it comes back year after year after year.
You don't want to do that to him, I'm telling you.
That's why I'm always a hot mess on take-your-daughter-to-work day.
Robby: Uh-oh. It's the senior citizens choir.
Get the tissues!
Winston: Look, I'll tell you what, Jess.
I'll keep him busy for the day.
You can destroy him tomorrow.
Thank you, Winston.
You know what? Next take-your-daughter-to-work-day is gonna be take-Winston-out- for-spaghetti day.
I would enjoy that.
I would enjoy that for real.
[knocking]
Ooh, it's my daddy!
It's my daddy!
Gobble, gobble.
Happy Thanksgiving, son.
I hope you're ready, 'cause I have a full day planned for us.
First up is a game of American football featuring the Cowboys of Dallas.
[crying]
I'm sorry.
It's our first Thanksgiving together.
Look, I've been crying all morning, too.
It's... this is a good thing.
Ann Kim broke up with me.
Oh, no.
Excuse me.
Da...
Jess: Gavin!
Happy Thanksgiving.
Nick: Hey, Gavin.
It just got a whole lot happier.
Excuse me.
Daddy?
You remember when you tongue-kissed that guy?
Man [on TV]: Now this marching band has traveled 1,500 miles...
What you taking? Little boy blues?
Yeah, I've been there.
How many miggies you working with?
Yeah, my pharmacist bumped me up to nine.
1,400. Yeah. I have to take 18 pills an hour in a very specific order, and they virtually assured me that I will be addicted to them.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, what happened to Rick Snip?
Uh, gone and, uh... [sniffles, sighs] these tears... honestly, they're from the onions.
They're not from Reagan bailing.
Oh, no. Reagan's not coming?
No. She just called. Uh, her boss sent her to Omaha, so she can't make it, but it's fine.
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.
I also wear a slow-release opium patch on my spine.
[laughs]
Hey, I ever told you the story of how I got injured in the first place?
Yes.
One may think that it started because of a lack of bagels, but no.
It started with a surplus... of cream cheese.
Of cream cheese.
Yes, yes, you're familiar with such happening.
You know what? I think Jess told me to help her...
No, no, no, no. You're good.
Uh, lock you up. [laughs]
I'm sure she's bummed, too.
How long is she gonna be there?
No idea. I didn't ask.
I just said, "Happy Thanksgiving."
[sizzling]
[whooshing]
And then I hung up.
Okay, you're gonna have to leave the kitchen.
The whole sad-guy, whiskey-flame combination is starting to worry me.
Let me know when my whiskey boils down to a crystal so I can eat it.
Hey, Dad, are you okay in there?
Did you fall in?
That's a dad joke that I would've assumed I would have heard you make had you been around more.
Gavin: I want you to know I'm not using the bathroom.
I'm just sitting here.
Hey, Dad, you know what's a great cure for heartache?
A little father-and-son time.
You know, we could have a catch, whittle a stick.
Why don't you just come out?
[door squeaks open]
I'm sorry, son. You're right.
Today is about family.
Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly.
There's my favorite whiskey glass.
Aah. Who wants to get wasted?
Me. So badly.
Ugh. I'm so sorry, babe.
Yeah. No. I'm-I'm fine.
Look, we don't wear sweaters and roll around in the leaves, but there are other ways for us to bond.
If he wants to drink, then, you know what? I'm gonna drink.
I'm gonna get sloppy with my poppy.
Nick. Papa! Wait for me.
Just need to get my bitters kit.
Ooh, actually, can you just make sure that there's a garbage can next to the bed?
Because... I can't hang.
[television playing nearby]
Robby!
What are you doing here with me and not with Winston?
I like Winston, but he's been telling this bagel story for ten minutes.
I haven't even met all the main characters yet.
Plus, I have a little surprise for you.
To make up for this morning, the airline gave me two free tickets to anywhere in the contiguous 48 states.
Oh. Ha.
Well, I'd love to, you know, plan our future, but we're eating in under four hours, and so I have to put you to work.
Okay, you just, crouton.
Oh.
All right. Keep croutonning.
Okay, I'm not that close to the table.
[clank] Darn it.
I was just in the bathroom...
Robby: Nothing but net. with my husband and his father.
Are you also having a good Thanksgiving?
Hey, Jess. Check this out.
Did that go in?
Robby got plane tickets, Swish. and he wants to whisk my away, Nothing but bowl. once he gets better, which could be months from now.
Jess, I'm looking up some hotels right now.
Twin bed's okay, right?
Hammer time?
Hammer time.
Cheers.
Yes, sir.
Ah. This is the dream.
A boy, his dad, his best friend sharing a drink.
Don't tell Mom, right?
[laughing]: I'm just kidding.
I know you and Mom haven't spoken in 30 years, including my wedding.
You know what's stupid?
There's a part of me that actually thought I might have a wedding with Ann Kim someday.
I don't think that's stupid at all, Dad.
I think that's beautiful.
You know, you opened up your heart to Ann Kim and that's brave.
Maybe she was just scared.
You know women. They're a mystery.
Yeah, sometimes they just go to Omaha and you don't know when they're gonna come back.
Or if they're coming back.
How do you even know she's in Omaha?
Oh, because, uh, she said she was.
Nothing means anything.
Nothing means anything.
Nothing... means anything.
At least you're young, Nick.
You got a rocking bod with kickass buns.
You're not gonna have any problems.
Who's gonna want an old guy like me?
I've got garbage buns.
What? Are you out of your mind? Dad, you've got fantastic buns.
You think?
I'm telling you, you've got nothing to worry about.
Nick, stand up, put your buns next to each other, so... here.
What is happening here?
I'm not doing anybody any favors today.
I'm a bummer.
Probably the best thing I could do would be to head home.
See you later, man, nice to see you again.
Dad, stay. Look... you're gonna land on your feet.
I've see... I've seen all kinds of women throw themselves at you.
Lifeguards and teachers, lens crafters.
Remember when you had your tongue in Jess' mouth?
She tasted like licorice... sweet but with a bite.
Not... you're not helping, Nick.
Actually, you know what? Can I see you in the hallway, please?
Why?
[groans]
Nick, we have got to go to Ann Kim's house and convince her to give my dad a second chance.
It's the only way he's gonna stay.
She's not gonna come. She's a snake.
All women are snakes.
I understand that you're spinning out about Reagan.
I'm spinning out about Reagan.
I get it. But you have to help me save my Thanksgiving with my dad.
You're right. I'm so sorry.
We can pull this off.
If we get her to take him back...
... We'd be heroes.
That's right.
[both laughing]
Look at that, Mom, I'm gonna be a hero.
Why are you looking up? Your mother is still alive.
I'm looking at Chicago.
You think Chicago is up?
It's north.
Robby, you're a great guy, but nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
However, someday you're gonna open a really wonderful bed and breakfast.
That was pretty good.
I mean, right?
Can you imagine the wine and cheese hour he would put on?
Stuff the toga with hot coals.
We're going out.
What? Wait.
Have a place setting at the table for Ann Kim, but don't seat her next to my dad.
I want all the couples split up.
Everybody gets to talk that way, but, uh... and then put me next to Nick.
Yeah.
And then my dad next to me as well.
So I'm sandwiched between Nick and my dad.
You guys can't leave. We need you here.
Well, I need a happy daddy.
He needs a happy daddy.
If they never come back, the last words I'll have heard my husband say are "happy daddy."
Okay, good luck.
Oh, smells great.
That's just my famous gravy. [chuckles]
The trick is, um, a pinch of brown sugar and then a couple more handfuls of brown sugar.
Actually, uh, just a lot of brown sugar.
Ann Kim loves gravy.
Big dogs, small horses, the smell of rain, and gasoline.
[sobbing]
Oh, Gavin.
You're a handsome and passionate and charismatic man.
You and me.
We really had something.
What do you say we give it another sh*t?
Let's just drive and drive and drive.
I know what I'm not thankful for this year.
This. This is it.
Robby, this is not what it looks...
Don't say anything.
I-I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just start by saying that is smells delicious in here.
I'm gonna leave.
[groans]
Just... hold on a second.
[clattering]
[groans]
Hey, Ann Kim, show your face.
You cold-hearted zombie.
Who's down there?
It's Gavin's son.
I don't know if you remember this, but we went on a double date once.
My wife got terribly ill from some truffle oil.
Rich foods don't agree with her.
Did Gavin send you?
No, no, no. He doesn't even know that I'm here.
Look, Ann Kim, he's heartbroken.
You opened up something inside of him, and you turned him into the man that I always knew that he could be.
And darn it, I'm just a kid... [sighs] hoping for a Thanksgiving miracle.
Why don't you give him a second chance and come back with us, and let's all give thanks together.
Great speech.
Yeah, it really was a great speech, man.
Thanks.
Did you do it with the five other women he's dating?
What?
That's why he always refers to me by my first and last name, because he's dating two Anns.
This is worse than my Reagan thing.
I can't believe that I spent all day feeling sorry for that son of a bitch.
I guess I'm the son of a bitch.
Leave or I'm hitting the sprinklers.
Ann Kim, please, give me a minute to process this.
Sprinklers!
That was not a minute!
Sprinklers!
That was not a minute!
No!
[knocking on door]
Hello, Jessica.
If you're here to hurt Robby, then you're here to hurt me.
And if you hurt me, then I'm gonna hurt Robby.
Wait a minute. No. If you're here...
If you don't get out of your room, I'm gonna bleach all your bird shirts.
Robby, I got to go.
That's a wise choice.
[sighs]
Robby, I need you to know that there is...
[exhales] nothing going on between me and Gavin, except for an icy awkwardness that will continue until one or both of us is d*ad.
Oh, thank God. [laughs]
I mean, I was sitting here thinking, really? Schmidt's dad.
I know. That'd be crazy, right?
Although I totally get it.
I mean... [exhales] he's got that rakish charm.
And that voice. Oh, my God.
Great buns and...
Robby, stop. There's more.
Oh, boy.
I think I know where this is going.
Let me guess.
You see me as more of a friend.
Well, I didn't want to talk about it on Thanksgiving.
But you brought the tickets and...
Jess, it's okay. I get it.
You know, there has to be that, um...
Oomph?
Yeah. I was gonna say "yowza," but, uh, oomph. You can't force the oomph, you know?
I'll take my mom to Phoenix. She's nuts about Phoenix.
Schmidt: Well, congrats, Dad!
Holiday's over! You ruined another Thanksgiving!
I can't believe that you're seeing six women.
What's going on?
How do you run a vineyard?
Not well. I'm seeing six women.
He tried to make it seven.
I caught him making a move on Jess.
Again? Why is my father so sexual?
Why is he asking Chicago?
Good question.
You know what, Gavin, if this is who you really are, then you can forget about Thanksgiving and all the holidays and all the non-holidays.
Pretty much what I'm talking about is every day.
Hey, hey, hey, guys, let's remember the reason for the season.
We're all very thankful.
Gavin: Jess, I am so sorry.
I had no idea you two were together.
I thought you were his physical therapist.
Physical therapist?
Aren't you a physical therapist or something?
You think she's a... Jess is a top-notch vice principal.
[grunts]
Jess: Oh, Robby...
Robby, no. Don't stand.
Your-your knee.
I don't give a flying care about that.
I stand up when I stand up for people.
I think you're getting roid rage.
I didn't take any steroids today, because the TSA took 'em this morning.
Now, what you're seeing is pure, unfiltered Robby, straight from the tap.
Get him, Robby.
You-you tried to make Jess the seventh woman you're dating, and you don't even know the first thing about her.
I mean, did-did you know that when she was six she tried to eat a lightning bug so that her heart would glow like E.T.?
Did you know that she tried to give herself Lyme disease out of solidarity to her fourth grade classmate?
Or-or that she never lets any of her electronics go below 25%, just in case someone else needs to use them?
I mean, did you know... did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?
It's so cute, man.
It would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess...
I'm... I'm...
Oh!
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
Thank you. But you don't.
Y-you're just desperate and lonely and you're trying to use her, and I...
Oh, it's happening again.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, oh.
Thank you.
You can't use Jess, because she is a dream girl.
Here's the last thing I'll say before I leave.
Jess, I know it's not me, but... [sighs] you deserve somebody who knows how special you are.
Um, I'm going. I'm going.
Don't go, Robby.
I'm not going out. I'm-I'm going down!
[gasping, shouting]
Robby, no!
Turkey! Turkey's down!
Robby! Robby!
Turkey's down!
Schmidt: Oh, God!
Relax!
[grunting]
Cece: Just...
Okay. It still looks good!
The turkey still looks good.
[screaming]
[sizzling]
Wait, what are you...
It is hot! My skin!
It's burning my skin!
The hell you doing?!
It was hot! It was hot!
Now I got to eat a dirty turkey! What's wrong with you?
Gavin: This is all my fault.
You know I throw hot things!
I'm so sorry.
It was fine!
Turkey's expensive!
Any more?
This isn't on me!
Furguson don't eat turkey from the ground!
Nick: Oh, no. I'm not taking the fall for this one.
It's all on you!
I'm not taking the...
Hey! Can we not yell at each other on Thanksgiving?!
I recognize that I, too, am yelling.
And I'm-I'm sorry, Robby.
Wait.
[elevator doors shut]
[sighs]
Great, he's gone.
[sighs] I was just starting to feel it.
Go.
Yeah, Jess, go.
Go.
Go!
Go after him.
Save us some floor turkey.
Hey.
Look, I know you had high hopes for Thanksgiving with your dad.
You called it.
The guy is who he is.
You know, maybe you just need to drop this idea that he'll ever be the bigger man.
I think that needs to be you, babe.
You're the bigger man.
Son, I know you're probably tired of hearing both these statements and not likely to believe either, but...
I'm leaving and I'm sorry.
Dad, I said... I said a lot of things earlier.
I don't want you out of my life.
I was waiting for you to be someone who you're not, but...
I know who you are and I still love you.
But you-you need to listen to me, son to father, get a therapist.
Oh, I have a therapist.
A better one.
Okay.
And I shouldn't have to say this but one that you're not sleeping with.
Okay.
Wait! Robby! Robby, don't go.
I tried to Irish good-bye, but, uh, I'm moving a little slow.
When you were in there and you were saying all those things, I realize I don't even really know you.
And I want to get to know you.
Jess, it's okay. I-I don't want you to force something that's not there.
I felt it.
You felt the oomph?
Yes. I... [sighs]
I'm sorry I'm being so confusing.
I-I think I'm as bad at Thanksgiving as I am at starting new relationships.
Yeah, you're pretty bad.

Mmm!
Remember when we had sex with strangers?
Jess: That's a misrepresentation of what happened.
Remember when your parents made it in the bathroom?

Cece, good news.
I'm making you bar manager!
Yeah, I finally want to focus on my writing.
And you can implement all the ideas that you've been suggesting.
All I said was that the ladies' bathroom needs more toilet paper.
And I want you to implement that... as manager.
All right.
Cece, this could be your whole future. What do you say?
"Whole future" makes it seem like I'm gonna grow old and die there, which is terrifying.
Oh, yeah, but... yeah...
I mean, I could use the money...
See, that's what I'm saying! You could use the money!
If you break it down hourly, it's less money.
Okay.
Don't do that math.
I'm fat!
I'm ready!
Look at this scarf.
I used to be able to wrap this scarf... exactly...
You go first. two and a half times, and the plaid layers would blend seamlessly.
Scarf looks fine, Schmidt.
Now the blend is several degrees from seamless, a... as you can see.
I've gained six pounds, maybe six and a half, I'm sure of it.
Honey, you look exactly the same to me.
Are you implying you gained six pounds in your neck?
I let my gym membership lapse when we were planning the wedding.
Now instead of a chiseled ten, I'm a dumpy seven breathin' down six's back.
But it's fine. I just have to find a new gym.
Oh, you can come with me to mine...
I'll pick you up after work, okay?
Good. Now back to my thing.

Oh.

Yes. Totally about Dr. Sam and definitely not about any other specific individuals.
Anyway, I've spent the last few months self-improving my ass off and now I'm ready to get this bad boy back on the streets.

What?
Just date Robby.
Oh, Schmidt, not this again.
Why not? I mean, you guys get along.
He's clearly into you. You have that whole Tony thing, which was very inside and alienating.
Well, I do find Robby really funny and... he's as tall as you can be before it's weird.
See, I'd put him on the wrong side of that line, but that's just me. Who cares what I think?
Jess... go get him.
Oh. It's a colon drop?
Uh, I didn't order this.
Is it just me or is it colon here?
[laughs]
Yeah.
Hi, there.
Hey, the birds on your shirt look a little lonely.
Maybe they could use some company?
Nah.
They find it very fulfilling to play amongst themselves.
Find me if they change their mind.
Was she hitting on us?
Hey, what can give you?
I guess I'll get some calamari and some soup.
What's the soup of the day?
Actually, what I'm talking about? This is my bar. Who are you?
Oh, Nick, this is Donovan, the new bartender I hired.
Hey.
Hey, Donovan.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Uh, would you mind grabbing a-an extra keg?
Got it.
That's an interesting hire.
You-you see, bartenders are mostly, I don't know, grizzled guys, you know, with character or they're hot women who bring in grizzled guys with character.
I know. He's actually an aspiring model and I figure he'll bring in more women.
How would he bring in more women?
Because he is super hot.
That guy is super hot?
Yes.
Okay, if you say so.
I don't say so.
The Lord says so. That boy is off the charts.
I wouldn't know.
Okay, don't be that guy.
I'm not being that guy. I don't see it.
Don't be the, "Eh, I wouldn't know" guy.
It's a bad color on you.
No, I'm not saying it's a color.
I'm not even making... like... I don't see that he's more handsome.
I have been getting all kinds of female attention lately.
Did I suddenly get more attractive?
How should I know?! I don't see that kind of thing.
I'm just trying to write.
Babe.
Yeah, babe.
Babe.
Yes, babe?
You have a girlfriend now, which means you've got a lot of confidence and women love that.
Now, if you'll just keep making it clear that you have a girlfriend, it'll pass.
I hate shutting women down all damn night.
I want to be a source of light in the world.
Well...
That's why I always sit at the table with the little kids first.
[both laughing]
Man, that restaurant was so weird.
I feel like we were the only people not celebrating a birthday.
Well, it-it was called Birthdays.
♪ Birthday, birthday, birthday ♪
How's the chicken?
Sorry, what?
[people singing loudly]
How-how's your chicken?
What?
I was just saying, "How is your chicken?"
Oh, yeah. I have chicken.
Yes. Yeah.
I-I know you have it, but how...
I ordered the chicken.
What?
I ordered the chicken!
Right, right, right. Is it good, though?
It was a loud, horrible restaurant. [chuckles]
Sorry.
So why did I have so much fun?
Probably the company.
Yeah, I guess so. [chuckles]
Ow. What?
Sorry. [chuckles]
It's okay. I guess.
Well, night, pal.
Oh.
Be well.
Okay. Uh...
Jess, why are you not dressed for the gymnasia?
Hmm. I'm not going.
Why the hell not?
Oh, is it your birthday?
No. I just...
Did we forget your birthday? This is terrible.
It's not my birthday.
It's a big one, too, isn't it?
How old do you think I...
No, I'm eating leftovers from my date with Robby.
Did you go to Birthdays?
You know, if you get a chance, you should try the Birthdays Express at the airport.
I like it better. It's del...
Anyway, how was your date?
It was great and then it was disastrous.
Oh, so you had sex with him?
No.
The opposite.
The opposite?
So, you gave birth to him?
No. It was going really well.
It was fun and then at the end, he clearly wanted to kiss and I thought I did, too, and then... instead I just gave him the old Pittsburgh good-bye.
Chuck on the arm and a handshake?
Why would you do that?
Because, I...
[sighs]
In that moment, I just couldn't see myself spending the rest of my life with him.
80 years old, feeding him pea soup out of a tin cup.
I'm confused. Is this a happy ending for Jess Day?
I mean, where are you living at this point, under a bridge?
I see you and Cece and Nick and Reagan and Winston and Furguson...
Aly.
Sorry, that just came out. Winston and Aly.
And you're all in love, and I just... don't know if I'll ever have that magic with Robby.
See, this just proves my theory that if you were a man, you would have a very difficult time getting an erection.
You have a theory about that?
You're putting way too much pressure on yourself.
It's a date, it's not the rest of your life.
You had a good time, right?
Well, yeah, it was Robby.
He's the funniest guy in the world.
So lighten up. If you want to kiss him, kiss him.
Who knows... maybe you'll see if you have magic then.
You know what? You're right.
I was gonna try to avoid Robby, but funk that chicken!
I'm gonna go get my gym clothes on!
Yeah.
I'm gonna put my push-up bra on.
That's actually not a bra that pushes my breasts up, it's actually one that I do push-ups in.
I get it.
Smash these babies down.
Let's do it.
Ooh, no, Cece, you know it's not Jess' birthday, right?
Put that away.
Yeah, no, I know that.
Um, this gift is for you.
What?
Mm-hmm.
Cece... It's a scarf.
Yeah. [chuckles]
I love it.
Almost makes me want to go to Buffalo for work.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Look at... look at that.
Oh, no.
O-oh, no. Oh, no!
How long does she think my freakin' neck is?
It's a fat-man scarf.
My wife gave me a fat-man scarf!
I did a few freelance modeling gigs.
I was the "wowee face" for an amusement park ad.
[chuckles]: That's actually really great.
Oh, that was you.
We really gotta get you working.
Let me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.
Do some model looks.
All right.
Um, this one I call, "I just saw something patriotic."
All right...
It was an eagle.
I was gonna say eagle.
I want to show some range.
Show me "I just saw something unpatriotic."
How you gonna pull that off?
Oh.
That's some rich gravy, man.
I noticed you from across the way.
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm sorry, but let me be very clear.
I have a girlfriend., and I am very much so devoted to her.
Aw.
Here's my number. Use it.
She didn't listen to a word...
Throw a peanut out of frustration!
Okay, why are you even here?
I thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.
I would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.
This is insane... you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.
I do... How would I know?
Nick, please, that dude is hot as hell, man.
He is a member of the Hall of Fine.
He's more attractive than Joe Mangaroni.
Manga... Joe Menden...
Who are you thinking of?
Magic Mike's friend.
Oh, he's married to that...
Yeah, J Lo.
Joe Mangallini.
Joe Mangallini.
He's more attractive than Joe Mangallini.
Okay, I know for a fact... that this was the most attractive man in America for ten years.
I know that because magazines told me so.
But...
Okay...
Hey, Donovan, could you copy that?
You guys don't look anything alike.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you planning on speeding up at any point?
Oh, my God, Schmidt, are you walking on a decline?
This is what we call a "trudge," Jess.
My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?
[imitating police siren]
Uh, license and registration, please.
[laughing]
I had a great time last night, you know?
And thank you for taking that cake off my hands.
I would have eaten it for breakfast.
Huh, gross, right?
[chuckles]
Better get back to my uppers.
By the time this knee is fixed, I'm gonna look like the WB frog, you know?
[imitating WB frog]: ♪ Ba da bup a duh breeer. ♪
[laughs]
[chuckling]
That guy...
You're the only two people in here that enjoyed that.
Please go after him.
Hey, need a spot?
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great, thanks.
Hey, Jess, about last night, at the end there, I hope I wasn't...
No, you weren't, and I hope you didn't think that...
I just kinda thought that we were in synch, you know?
But then...
No, Robby...
I wanted to kiss you, too.
You did?
Oh...
Oh, well, Jess, I don't know if this is...
Oh, okay.
[both crying out]
[alarmed chatter]
Somebody call an ambulance.
Robby, are you okay?
I don't know, Robby hurt his mouth pretty bad here.
It hurts a lot. It felt good first, but then it hurts a lot now.
Jess: Just so you know, this is all your fault.
Oh, that's fair.
I should have made it very clear to you not to kiss Robby while he was balancing a dangerous amount of weight above his head.
There was a moment before the bar came down where we were just two people kissing, and... nothing.
No magic.
Look, at least now you know.
No harm done, right?
A tremendous amount of harm done.
Now I have to tell a man I maimed that I'm not interested.
On the bright side, you're not that hurt.
Come to think of it, how are you not more hurt?
When I was in triage, they said that my neck muscles had served as kind of a neck helmet, which made me feel like I was not talking to real doctors.
Anyway, I just have to wear this thing for the next few days just as a precaution.
Well, if you want to cover it up, Cece gave me a scarf that's perfect.
It's long enough to wrap around an above-ground pool filled with Alfredo sauce.
Alfredo sauce. Doesn't that sound good?
Not really.
I don't know.
Maybe Cece's right.
Maybe I am turning into a fat man.
Cece never called you fat.
Well, I am.
I'm a fat man married to a hot woman.
Cool, I'm a sitcom.
That sounds like a great show.
Throw in a wacky neighbor, I'm watching.
Maybe the reason why you don't want to go to the gym is 'cause you want to hang out with your beautiful wife.
Right?
And you're fat and happy because you're happy.
You're right.
I'm a lucky man.
A Lucky Man should be the name of your show.
You're a beleaguered casino owner, and a father of three.

Ooh.

He wants to work together.
That's amazing.
I got these release forms to sign.
You want me to take a look at them for you?
Yeah.
Okay. There we go. [clears throat]
Donovan, these terms are unacceptable.
He's really screwing you.
Aww...
You know what?
I'm gonna get on the phone with him, because if we start treating our attractive people like this, our society is gonna collapse.
[sighs] Hey, man, you busy writing?
What does it look like?
Want a rain-stick?
Some girl gave it to me.
You know, I'm getting a lot of gifts from women who want to sleep with me lately.
You know? It's hopeless, man.
I'm so damn confident.
Winston, I was really hoping to make headway on this, but uh, we got to put out this f*re, don't we?
It's hot.
Hmm.
You're too confident.
Too confident ain't the word.
I'm at a whole new level.
Do you remember when you were taking the bus to the farmer's market and it h*t a bump and you soiled yourself?
That was not my favorite Arbor Day. [laughs]
Why you, uh... why are you bringing that up?
Remember when you, uh, were in the park, and a bee flew into your mouth and then you fell off the bridge at that place where all the ducks go to the bathroom?
I see what you're doing. Keep it going.
Remember when you had to leave Latvia because you weren't good enough to be a professional basketball player, and you came back home to be a full time babysitter?
Okay. All right. Time out.
You know, you, you h*t a nerve.
Okay.
Definitely brought me down a peg.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I needed it.
Okay.
Okay.
I feel some less confident now.
My man. [laughs]
[laughing]: All right, then.
All right. Back to my novel.
[upbeat song playing on radio]
You're still on that?
I can't figure it out.
Look. Imagine a world where you woke up one morning and instead of your face, you had Donovan's face.
Whoa.
And instead of your body, you had his.
How would you feel?
If I had his face and his body?
Oh-hoo, yeah.
I'd feel fantastic.
And that's... how you know he's attractive.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Can I have a minute with this, please?
Oh, sure thing.
Can I interest you in some white noise?
Yes, please.
[shakes rain-stick contents]
[contents falling like rain]
Hmm.
[contents falling]
So, when a man looks like a man that you wouldn't mind looking like, that's a way to assess a man's attractiveness.
Exactly.
Oh!
Cece: That's right.
You are gonna draw up a brand new agreement for Donovan to sign.
Hell, yeah, you're gonna have a courier bring it over to me right now.
And, uh, listen closely, Marco, Donovan subsection H is a deal breaker, so, rip it out of the agreement and burn it.
Or we're walking.
Look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, bye.
That was amazing.
Yeah.

And I wouldn't mind having their bodies.

'Cause she would live in my room, but she'd still pay rent.
And then you could have that multipurpose room where you could shower and cook.
Well, I'd still use the bathroom and the kitchen for showering and cooking, but I would use the multipurpose room for everything else, [chuckles] and I'd be living across the hall from my ex and his new girlfriend.
Not sure why I said those two in the same tone.
You know what, forget it actually.

So we're at maximum capacity. So what do we do?
Okay, so p*rn house has to go into the vault.
Agreed.
So what do we declassify?
Jalapeño 19?
Jalapeño 19? No way.
Uh... Duck, Duck, Gavin?
Oh, Duck, Duck, Gavin has to stay a secret.
I would love to keep Upper Deck Timeshare between us and the guy we paid off.
There are no good options. Are you sure this is the house?
I think so, but maybe not.
Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. I'm going to watch with fresh eyes and I'm gonna see what my gut tells me, okay?
Yeah.
You go around the house, you take photos... for comparison.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
We'll look at all the pics, we'll come back here later, Mm-hmm.
We'll make a, you know, a final call.
Boom.
[chuckles]
I need the phone for pictures.
I need it to watch the p*rn.
Use your phone.
It already started buffering.
It's two minutes in.
[quietly]: It's buffering.
Take mine... and take pictures with that.
Makes sense. It's very smart, and that is why we are The Keepers of the Five Secrets.
Keepers of the Five Secrets.
[Chinese flute music playing]
Shh.
[whispers]: Don't say a word.
[groans]
[sighs]
Gah!
Secret ballots are never really secret. You know that, right?
Okay fine. You got me.
I voted nay.
It would just be six people for too long.
We would continue to be a married couple living with three roommates.
You want to make it four, increasing our humiliation by 33%.
Mr. Miller has no interest in seeing you humiliated.
And as such, I've been empowered to offer you the following.
I'm listening.
As a symbolic gesture, Reagan cannot list the loft as her official residence.
Where will her mail go?
A P.O. Box.
Oh, yeah. All right, keep going.
When asked where you live, you and Reagan will say the following.
"Geez, beats us. We're just dumb kids living paycheck to paycheck. Thank gosh for our upwardly mobile friends Schmidt and Cece, and the three guest rooms in their loft. We're crashing with them until we get our lives together and we remain there at their pleasure."
Do I have to memorize all that?
No, you can just read it from the toilet paper.
[sighs]
And finally... you will allow Schmidt to buy you one pair of jeans.
Oh, he's serious.
♪ ♪
Hey, Jess.
Did Schmidt tell you I was gonna be in here?
No.
Then how come you didn't get scared?
Before I enter any bathroom, I take a moment to myself and say, "No matter what happens in there, don't get scared."
And it works, you know, except for that one time when I was at the Cubs...
Okay Jess, don't move.
What's happening?
Don't worry about it.
Hey, do me a favor.
Put an arch in your back, just...
[clicks]
Got it. Okay.
Let's take one together.
Oh, like a prom picture.
Yeah, kind of.
[strains]: Here we...
[clicking]
Got it.
I actually might need to retake that. I think my eyes were closed.
But first, let me see if any of this pork makes your tummy rumble.
Winston would like you and Reagan to spend a mutually agreed upon amount of time as a couple with Ferguson.
We're talking about the cat?
The only couples that Ferguson knows are interracial.
And while Winston views this as progress, he knows that it's not an accurate portrayal of... the world.
You even think that cat knows Winston exists?
Definitely not. Next, Winston would like to be the first person to see you in your new jeans.
And he will see you under these circumstances, and these circumstances only: descending a grand spiral staircase, as Winston waits at the bottom, weeping with pride, holding your new belt.
He wants me to go upstairs without a belt.
Some... We rent a really nice mansion.
Hey, you could do it, like, a museum...
I'm not going to a public place and doing this with him.
Do you want the yays or not?
I need the yays.
The motion on the floor is the same, with some riders, most notably... the Furguson Bishop, White Immersion Program.
Um, four yays, one nay?
Who's this nay?
I asked you what you wanted.
And I voted yay.
That was about the vote?
I thought y'all just wanted to get to know me better.
I was already a yay.
Well, that's everybody. Who's left?
Parikh, prepare to be buttonholed.
I'm sorry I took your yay for granted.
Let me wet your beak a little bit... you want sink time, you want fridge space, you want Schmidt and Winston to let you in on this whole jeans thing?
No, I don't want anything, okay.
I voted nay because I'm trying to protect you.
From who?
From you, you lunatic.
You were being a good friend to Nick by letting Reagan move in, but I wouldn't be a good friend to you if I just let that happen.
If Nick wants Reagan to move in, then I want Reagan to move in.
I mean, I don't want her to move in, but I... I support it.
You can support something without being the poster child for it, okay, so just maybe take a step back.
I can't do that because my love for Nick exists, so it has to come out somewhere.
If you put water in Bugs Bunny's hole, it's gonna sh**t out some other hole where Elmer Fudd least expects it.
Is this other hole friendship?
Exactly. So I can't express my feelings for Nick through my romance hole, so I need to express them through my friendship hole.
And I really regret hitching my wagon to "hole."
But you... you get it, okay?
I want you to know I'm gonna be fine, okay?
You promise?
I promise.
Okay, all right, I'll vote yay.
If Nick and Reagan aren't physical outside of their room.
I'm sorry, but I have to protect you a little, okay, so just deal with it.
That's a really great rider, Cece.
You see, I think this is the tub where Daddy bathes the Soviet dissident.
And this has to be the window seat where he spanks the Aztec twins.
Hey, side note, thank you for voting yay on the Reagan vote.
I really want her to move in. I think I'm ready for this.
She will, and you are very much so ready.
Yeah. Yeah.
So many close-ups. It's so frustrating. I mean, for our purposes of today.
You know, mostly when they cut to wide I'm thinking why the hell are you showing me the room?
But now I want to see the room. I don't want to see the close-ups.
Well, there's only one thing left.
[phone chimes]
Search the locations manager for the 1971 adult film Daddy's Longleg.
Very smart.
[chimes] SEARCH VOICE: Searching now.
[Chinese flute music playing]
Secrets.
Secrets.
Cece, this is the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.
I had always assumed that when you got serious about interior design, I was going to love your ideas.
Because I love you.
I hate your ideas. I hate them almost as much as I love you, which is so much.
I have to stop you right there.
I appreciate the fact that you are a very dramatic man, but the next time you start a conversation with, "This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to say to you," it better end with, "I'm gay now," "I found a lump in my nut," or, "He came out of nowhere, help me get the blood off of my car."
I can't live in a house that you don't love.
And I also can't live in a house of horrors!
Thank you for taking my note about being dramatic.
Next time you don't like one of my suggestions, just tell me.
I don't like your suggestions.
Okay, well, then you suggest something, and then I suggest something, and eventually we reach a compromise.
So let's try it. Let's try it with the cabinets.
I suggest a lighter wood, like birch.
Absolutely not.
I mean... [clears throat]
Mm-hmm.
I suggest a darker wood, like walnut.
So now we try to find something in the middle, like, how about oak?
That's fine, that's fine, I'm willing to go darker.
Cherry? Mahogany?
Walnut?
I love that suggestion!
It was your suggestion. It's not a compromise.
Okay, fine, birch.
No!
That was my suggestion. That's still not a compromise.
Now you're confusing me!
Jess [shouting]: Emergency off-site loft meeting!
Jess: Nick. Nick, it's time for the final vote. Where are you?
The motion now includes the Cece Parikh Hallway Decency Act.
Ugh! There's still one nay in here!
Okay, I voted yay, I swear.
Then who was it?
Woman [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions.
You have a real guilty look on your face... a real nay face.
This is not my nay face. This is... this is how does a man compromise his vision face.
Man [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions, this is Clem.
Uh, yeah, Clem, um. I'm calling about the whereabou...
[grunting]
Winston!
Clem: Sir, are you auditioning?
Admit it!
Why?
Oh... Aah...
Why?
It doesn't matter who voted nay.
The message is clear, somebody doesn't want Reagan in the loft.
So who cares who did it? Let's move on.
Who is that person? I hate that person.
Also, maybe somebody realized moments before the vote that, if you think about it, my bed... it-it tilts west.
And so she could roll off the bed in the middle of the night, and on the floor, and my floor tilts east...
Nick.
Which means she could roll under my bed and be lost forever.
Did you vote nay?
Yeah, of course I did.
I don't know what I want. I'm confused.
Ooh-whee! Politics!
Schmidt, you need to take these design blinders off and look around.
We compromise all the time.
We named our house Jaipur Aviv.
That's right.
I wanted to call it Ghatak/Mossad HQ, and you wanted to call it...
Our House.
Our House, yes.
We met in the middle and we called it Jaipur Aviv.
You know what, every compromise doesn't have to be 50-50.
I've been looking at cabinets online.
They all look exactly the same to me.
No, they don't.
They really do.
Birch, walnut, mahogany, fiberglass, stainless steel.
You can't tell the difference between metal and wood?
Not when it comes to a cabinet.
I just see cabinet, and then I go, like, "Oh, my plate's in there."
I think this is a bigger issue than interior design.
I think it just applies to cabinets.
And I accept the fact that I am not good at interior design, and you're brilliant at it.
So you should take the lead on that.
Just like I'm no good at cooking Indian food.
Mm.
You take the lead on that.
You always let me make dessert.
I always burn it.
I just want you to feel included.
Even if it's in just some small, symbolic way.
[doorbell plays "La Cucaracha"]
[melody repeats]
[melody repeats]
Okay.
Hey.
Do you know how anything works?
I know you whipped and you buttonholed and you swing-setted your tail off to get all these votes.
Who did I swing-set?
Once I got the votes, I panicked.
Because I realized that now I have to ask her, and what if she says no?
Or worse, what if she says yes, moves in with me, and then regrets it?
I wish we'd had this conversation at the beginning of the day, but yeah, I mean, I get it, it's scary.
Well, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.
You know, tell me I should vote yay.
Nick, I whipped everyone's votes.
I'm not gonna whip yours.
But whatever you decide, I support you.
We all do.
If I vote yay, all that means is is that I can ask her.
Emphasis on "can."
And that I don't have to. Emphasis on "have."
Wow. Well, no one loves parsing more than I do, and even I find this tedious, but... yes.
All right, slide me over.
Okay.
Okay.
Whoa, is this wall just sticky, or is it... magnetic?
We have got to get a magnetic wall.
We will never buy another coil of wires connected to a battery again in our lives.
It'll pay for itself in a week. [scoffs]
[Daddy's Longleg playing over phone]
Okay, Roughstuff Productions referred me to their former subsidiary Tick Tock Erotica, LLC, which split from Roughstuff back in '09.
But here's the thing. Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.
And they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.
Did he know where they sh*t it?
He did not.
All right, we've got to give up a secret.
The only question is who breaks the news.
I'll break the news if I get to pick the secret.
Deal. But I really recommend that you tell him about Halloween 2004.
Halloween 2004.
That's what I was gonna say.
[Chinese flute music playing]
Secrets exchanged.
Secrets exchanged.
Shh.
Woman [over phone]: I could never say no to the man that saved my sled dogs.

Schmidt, I need to tell you something unpleasant about some candy you ate.
[door opens, closes]
What?
Many years...
It was sh*t in Seattle.
Daddy's Longleg was sh*t in Seattle.
What's Daddy's Longleg?
A p*rn movie Winston and I really like.
You don't have to worry about it.
Because... it was... not filmed in your home.
So congratulations!
Wow, we did it, honey.
Was that in question?
Hey, did you ask Reagan?
I've decided to ask her, but I haven't asked her yet.
I don't know how to.
All I've got right now is, "Hey, Nickname"... that's what we're calling each other until we can think of something better.
Uh... and after that, I'm a little stumped.
Well, why do you want Reagan to move in?
Because I want to spend a lot of time with her, and if she moves in, I'll be able to spend more time with her.
Well, if she moved in, how would that make you feel, Nick?
I'd feel honored.
Honored or happy?
Both.
And what's your name?
My name is Nick.
Probably could've got that on my own.
Noted.
Wow.
I mean, that's perfect. And it's already on my phone.
But there's just some things I want to agonize over out loud with you guys.
And send.
I wanted to agonize, I said I needed to agonize I've to tell you. That was great.
God bless you.

Just tell her it's fine.
Did you tell Schmidt to do a roast tonight?
Funk yeah, I did. That's how you deal with this town.
Well, I think that's a huge mistake.
What, to defend your husband?
I didn't say that, Louise.
Mom, how's this?
"In conclusion, you're ugly. I make money.
"You just got roasted by the California Kid."
I think it's sensational.
[chuckles]
Can you please just get back here?
We're not ready yet!
We're not ready yet, 'cause I got to do something that you didn't know I was about to do.
Do it!
Blow your mind. Oh.
Another piece of the puzzle!
Whoa!
We're taking it to the top!
Do it, do it, [chanting "Do it!"]
Thank you for starting that chant.
Do... You got it.
Okay, it's, uh... it's looking like we have to do it.
Okay, I don't know what "it" is.
"It" is looking like a jump.
Okay, that is bone-chilling news. It's too long.
Look, we have no choice, okay? We got to get to Long Island.
[chanting continues]
We can do it. We can do it.
All right! Here we go!
Okay! Here we go! Here we go!
[chanting continues]
On the count of three.
[chanting continues]
One, two, three.
♪ Let this be a moment ♪
[distorted grunt]
♪ A moment you shine ♪
[distorted]: You can do it!
♪ 'Cause you can do anything. ♪
[grunts]
[crowd groans]
[Nick groans]
Charles: That was great. That was great!
[Nick continuing groaning] I broke my back.
Winston.
We-Well, your car should be fixed by morning.
How do I know you're not lying?
I never lie.
Although I told my mother her hair looked good once... and it didn't.
Just looked okay.
Okay, I believe you, even though you're from the city of garbage water and pizza trash.
What is your problem with this city?
[sighs]
I've just never had a good experience here.
I came here once before and it was a complete disaster.
Did you go to the opera and were disappointed?
It's this new director.
No, I actually...
I had this great week planned, and then thing after thing went wrong, and then I cut my trip off early.
Oh, my God.
[gasps]
Oh, my God.
That's when that was?
Obviously, I don't know because I have no idea what you're talking about.
I left early and I went home and surprised my boyfriend.
♪ Who's that girl... ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪
Spencer was the actual worst.
He called sex "making tacos."
Well, you know what I always say?
Things happen for a reason...
Yes, and the reason that New York sucked was because I was supposed to catch Spencer, No, you didn't let me finish.
.. 'cause I wasn't supposed to end up with him.
I always say things happen for a reason, and that reason is random chance.
No, you were right the first time.
New York wasn't kicking my ass, it was nudging it, gently, in the right direction.
[gasps]
Just like you are right now.
Yes.
Yes, that's what's happening.
You can't be mad at your past... it makes you who you are. And...
Oh, my God.
I told my friend to do something really stupid, and I have to go stop him.
Hey, do you want to do something very, super considerate?
We can't provide you with a police escort.
I wasn't gonna ask that.
Yeah, you were.
Yeah, I was.
But here: my lunch.
It's not Schmaegalman's, but take it. It's Ling's Palace.
It's fine.
It's just fine.
Oh, Dragon! Did I miss it?
Uh-uh. It's cool.
That's a really realistic-looking costume, with the smoke and everything.
Oh, you're just hotboxing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a vice principal.
Hey...
Oh!
You're a mess, dude.
[laughs]
And with Fitzgerald High's new scoreboard, we can make Great Neck great again.
[laughs]
Wait, wait, Schmidt.
What? What, is my makeup too thick?
What? No, no, you look great.
Uh, look, you can't do this. I was wrong.
Wh... What are you talking about? This was your idea.
I know. But I was wrong.
You can't be mad at these people.
But they were all horrible to me Jess.
And that's why you left.
You created your own path.
You changed cities. You made friends.
You found your purpose. You met the love of your life.
I sure did.
Just enjoy your evening.
You know, you have nothing to say to these people.
If anything... Thank you.
I can't wait to see the look on Schmidt's face when he realizes we made it.
Well, he wanted us to make it.
As I was saying, though, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realizes that we made it, though, right?
That's just gonna be like, "Oh."
I know, but... just be exc... Yeah, I can't wait, though, right?
Okay? We can't score without you.
[laughs]
Whoa. Hello.
Is this Schmidt? What... what are you doing?
Um... [clears throat] Excuse me, Marissa, I'm very sorry.
I... I would just be remiss if I let this moment pass me by.
You know, I'm a lucky man.
Because I wouldn't be the man that I am today if it weren't for the experiences that I've had right here.
So, thank you... for being the worst that humankind has to offer.
That includes Harvey Levin and every cast member that's ever been on The Real World/Road Rules Challenge.
Thank you for showing me that athletic apparel is something that should never be worn outside the house, you chubby-thumbed pickle hoarders.
And in conclusion, you're all ugly. I make money.
You just got roasted by the California Kid. I did it!
Oh, you sure do talk a lot when your mouth isn't full...
Great Neck.
[laughter]
Thank you, Schmidt. Boy, that was real embarrassing for you, huh?
They're taunting my baby.
This is not good.
[gasps]
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Cece Schmidt.
So if any of you have anything else you'd like to say to my husband, I will drag you outside and we will handle this L.A. style.
I will take you to the corner of Fairfax and La Brea.
Those are parallel streets. I'm not telling her that.
That's my daughter!
[crowd booing]
We have to leave. Where's my car?
Even though your car is definitely here, it's a beautiful night... let's walk.
Okay, look, she clearly did something weird with your car, but I got something.
Trust us.
Cece: Sepulveda! La Cienega, bitches. El Matador beach.
You're just naming places in Southern California.
Cece: Nickel Canyon!
What the...
Told you we were men of means.
Men of means!
[all cheering]
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
All right!
Winston: Scoot over, scoot over, I can't fit.
Later, bro...
Tell 'em this story, Denny.
Tell 'em all!
You guys have a good time. All right. Uh... [grunts]
Oh, man, I'm a mess.
God, it's a perfect fall New York day. I'm almost sorry we're leaving.
Coach: What the hell is going on?
Were you not gonna call me?
How long you been here?
We literally just got here.
Well, we were gonna go...
I had a, uh...
If I wasn't...
If I didn't just run into you, you guys would have just been...
The only reason I'm not pissed... it's because I've been in L.A. like five times.
So... we're good.
[all cheering]
I've got other friends
I am so excited about this glamping trip.
Sleeping bags are for hobos and children.
Winston: I am so pumped for this trip.
Aly and I figured out how many times we would have had sex since we've been apart, and it's a whole bunch.
And we're gonna play catch-up on all of it.
All 52 times.
I am about to take Aly to Mount Smushmore.
Know what I'm saying? [laughs]
Aw. That's lovely.
We need to invite other people.
What about Nick?
No, he can't.
He has some big writing weekend.
Wants me to give him notes on his novel.
He has all the pages in some large freezer bag.
It's a hard presentation to get excited about.
You know who would really want to come?
[groans]
I am in!
Do you want me to bring my retractable s'mores pole?
Is that the car antenna that you've been putting in the dishwasher?
That is a low-level mystery that is driving me insane.
Making him crazy.
It's really handy.
All right, Jess. So just a quick warning, okay?
This is a pretty couple-y's trip, and... you know, we just don't want you to feel like a third wheel.
Yeah.
Oh. I have people I can bring.
You...
I joined a singles group.
You're meeting new people.
I think that's great.
[quietly]: Oh, my.
It's actually... a group of all singles dedicated to keeping each other single.
Wow.
I think they could probably come on the trip.
Emotionally, they may not be available, but socially, they're available as hell.
[quietly]: Just talk to her really quickly.
You know what?
Oh, you're already texting people.
They're probably not...
They're in!
Oh!
All of them! [laughing]
Honestly, they would have gone to the DMV with you, if you had asked.
[laughing]
♪ ♪
[inhales] [yells]
How long have you been standing there?
[whines]
What happened to you?
The Pepperwood Chronicles, that's what happened to me.
So it's really that bad.
Nick.
This book... is magnificent.
What?
Julius Pepperwood?
A hard-boiled Chicago cop turned New Orleans detective, racing around on fan-boats, drowning that two-faced DA in a bucket of jambalaya.
Yeah. Right in the jambalaya.
Finding John F. Kennedy... alive?
That wasn't too far?
It's a masterpiece, Nick.
Is that my whiteboard?
You said I could have it.
Well, we both know that's not true, but if it helps you get more of this story out, then, yes, you are welcome to it.
Well, all right, Schmidt, h*t me; I want your notes.
No notes!
No notes?
No notes.
No notes?!
No notes.
No notes!
No notes.
No notes!
No notes. It's perfect, Nick.
I want another chapter by the time I get back on Sunday.
Then I guess it's time for me to get to work.
My little wobbly-nosed Michael Chabon.
[both laugh]
Hey, congratulations.
Thank you, man.
I, uh... Thank you. I needed it.
I'm a writer.
[shrieks] 'Sup?
[both laughing]
[smooching] ALY: I love you. I miss you. I love you. I miss you.
You clearly didn't get my text, because your pants are still on.
[grunts]
[whooping] So excited about this.
Hey, Aly! Oh!
Your bra's already off. Okay.
We're out the door.
None of this in my car, please.
I just had it shampooed.
Jess.
I called ahead and got us an early yurt check-in.
Oh.
Beep-beep.
People about to have sex coming through.
Winston: Look out. Aren't you coming?
Actually, I'm gonna go with my group.
We rented a van. It has a built-in microwave.
We're all really stoked about it.
You're not making me feel any better about this group of strangers.
Well, it's not all strangers.
Some of them are friends! [laughing]
Robby?
My Robby?
Yeah. I got here way too early, so I've just been standing outside, kind of waiting for my opportunity to enter.
How'd I do?
Robby, are you in this group?
[snorts]
[laughing]: Is he in the group?
Robby is the founder, president, and secretary of the group.
I formed the group after Nadia dumped me.
I always use two sugars.
My mom says 'cause I'm so sweet, you know.
Oh, whoa!
I didn't want to be alone, but I also didn't want to be in a relationship.
And that's when he got the idea to bring people together to help each other stay single.
Yeah, we meet weekly for non-romantic companionship.
But most of all, we just have fun.
Yeah.
Like last week, we shut down this Korean barbecue.
We paid with 13 different credit cards, and we were asked to never come back again.
It was epic!
That sounds awesome.
Oh, man.
It's a really cool group, and we have our own motto.
Both: "I'm single and I'm sufficient."
That's I-S-I-S. That's !sis.
Th-that's !sis.
Oh, my God.
You're asking people to join !sis.
No, n-n-n-n-n-n-no.
As communication czar I should have caught that.
Yeah.
Isn't this group just a painfully transparent stall until you meet someone?
Being single is a choice.
Yeah.
Don't single-shame.
What is single-shame?
No, honey. He was not single-shaming you.
I-I wasn't...
That was not his intention at all.
I don't even know what that is.
Couples always try to talk down to singles.
We can do everything that you guys can do.
I take myself out for a dessert date every Sunday.
Yeah, and yesterday, I had a backache, and I rubbed it myself, in a doorjamb.
This is bummin' me out.
Is this group gonna be a bummer? Be honest.
Absolutely not.
There's Brenda.
She's a circuit court judge who also teaches taxidermy class for kids.
And Hugh. He grows his own onions.
My former boss and current friend, Principal Foster.
His hip surgeon has okayed him for sex, but he hasn't okayed himself.
And of course, Robby, our leader.
Have you ever seen a group more ready to have fun with themselves?
[cheering]
[horse hooves clopping]
Just look at this view; we needed this so badly.
It's-it's perfect.
Is it, though?
[camera shutters clicking]
Can you stop hogging the vista?
There are other people who would like to take a photo.
I don't want to lose this light.
It's a traditional high-noon.
Don't couple-splain light to us.
It just seems like it would be easier if you guys took a group photo.
We actually need a picture for our web site, Oh, yeah.
So, all right, you can take a group photo.
All right, let's do this.
Now, I'm only taking one sh*t, so if the first one's a silly one, you're gonna have to live with a silly one.
Okay. One, two, three. There we go. Great photo.
I'm gonna need one, too.
Actually, we're all gonna need one.
What?
Yeah, we don't share phones like you people.
Who shares phones?
How would we call each other?
I don't know.
I can't do this. This is... Take these back.
You guys are ruining a perfectly good vista moment.
Can't you go someplace else and "enjoy being single"?
[gasps] Did you just quote-hands "enjoy being single" to us?
You guys are telling each other that you're happy being this, when we all know that you would rather be this.
No. This is jazz hands, the end of an expl*sive musical number.
This is O.J. trying to put on the bloody glove.
This is freedom!
This is flying!
This is praying that you can go back to this!
This is high fives for everybody!
All around! Yes! [chuckling]
Let's go to the lake, guys. Bye.
Foster: I call dibs on the slime-free part.
Okay.
Just enjoy the view. I mean...
This is O.J. putting back on the glove.
No notes.
Okay, just... just start and see what... Just start. No notes.
All me.
No notes. What does "no notes" even mean?!
No notes.
No notes?
Come on.
[chuckles]
Nick, I'm communing with nature, and I'm almost at peace.
What do you want?
No notes?
Seriously?
It is just so nice to get out of the city and watch TV.
What about this dumb thing? When Pepperwood just watches a block of local news.
Oh, I found that part to be gutting, Nick. I mean, the irony that Pepperwood's violent world is being translated into sound bites for mass consumption...
That's just me transcribing Channel 3 News!
I didn't even change the anchors' names!
It's called realism, Nick.
No.
Good-bye, genius.
No!
[groans]
Ooh, that was... Ooh.
Winston: Oh, my gosh.
13 times.
Yeah. It's a lot of times.
A lot of times.
[chuckles] I had a good time.
I had a great time.
I could've gone so many more times than that.
Yeah, that's actually nothing.
[both chuckle]
I could go all night, girl.
I could go tens of... so many more times.
Tens of... Ten... Yeah.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[sighs] Cool, cool, cool, cool.
That's what's up. That's what's up.
[phone ringing]
That's what's up.
Oh, it's the phone.
[breathy]: Hella?
Winston, are you...
Hey, Winnie, are you okay?
You sound like you're being chased up a hill.
Oh, no. Aly and I are just breaking each other off basically nonstop. It's Nick.
I told him we were breaking each other off basically nonstop.
I know. I can hear you, honey.
Oh, you heard everything? Okay.
What does he want?
I'm in crisis right now. Could you read my book and give me notes, please?
Oh, man. I don't want to take a break.
Mmm. Mm-mm.
I'm like a freight train right now.
I can't slow down.
Me either.
This is crisis!
But...
Guys, supporting our friend's artistic endeavors is also insanely...
Hey, guys. Guys, pay attention.
It's sexy.
This is crisis.
But I was thinking the same thing.
Oh, thank God.
Hello? Winston! Winston, We could easily just both read the book you're supposed to be my friend.
At the same time, and then when we're done, just get right back at it.
Right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Great. Now, do y... do you guys want a PDF or do you want 100 individual JPEGs?
JPEGs, JPEGs, J... JPEGs.
Uh, 100 individual JPEGs, please.
Yeah! This is gonna take forever.
[laughing]
[groans]
Five-three.
[grunts]
Hey. Oh, I was just... just playing a little single and sufficient badminton.
Well, I hope you worked up an appetite, because I'm gonna make my Singles Sliders.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, so what I do is I take the meat from three different sliders, and then I just sort of mash 'em into one big boy that stands on his own.
Oh. So, like a burger.
Yeah, it's like a burger except it's bigger.
Oh. Well, if it isn't Schmidt.
Or should I call you Schmidt-tata 'cause you have so much egg on your face?
You little Italian egg omelet.
[laughs, snorts] Nice.
Jess, what's happening in the lake over there?
Wait, is that a jellyfish?
Come over here.
Oh, please, that's so much less sexual than the stuff that you and Nick do on a regular basis.
[chuckles] Ow.
[sighs]
It's happening.
Okay, Robby...
I'm on it.
[Hugh and Brenda laughing]
Guys, guys.
No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?
You guys know that you can only be in this group if you're single, right?
It's tough.
I'm very horny.
I want you guys to be strong.
Let's do the motto.
"I'm single I'm single and I'm sufficient."
"and I'm sufficient".
Didn't sound like you meant it. One more.
Both: "I'm single and I'm sufficient."
Yes.
One last time.
"I'm single and I'm sufficient!"
Yes!
Foster: Well, I just hope we don't see a repeat of that kind of behavior with me later on.
You were amazing out there. Your ability to dampen sexual chemistry is astounding.
[chuckles softly]
Uh... [clears throat] Thanks.
Foster: Hey, guys!
I just caught a fish with my hand!
Wow. Nick's book is astonishing.
I thought it was gonna take forever, but... it was perfect.
He really brings you into the world.
Every minor character is so well thought out.
The newsboy? You could see his whole life.
And am I the only one who thought that the m*rder's name was in the song?
The m*rder's song was in the song!
Ah. So good.
No notes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well... sex?
Yes!
Yeah?
Sex.
I'm ready if you're ready.
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.
Just a short walk to our yurt.
Unless we take the scenic route.
Oh. Nothing gets me in the mood like scenery.
Mmm?
Let's do that.
Yeah, let's go that way.
Yeah, let's do that. The scenic way.
Perhaps you could find the perfect bun if... I don't know... You had your glasses.
Oh. Oh, you know... you know who else has glasses?
Six out of ten people in the developed world, including Robby and I?
Jess, just give over to it. We're happy for you.
Use your yurt. You have a world-class yurt.
Yeah, and if this is about me and Robby dating years ago, trust me, it doesn't matter.
Mm-mm.
We only did hand stuff, per his neurosis, [groans] so you totally have my blessing.
Blessing for what?
This.
That.
Guys, I am not into Robby.
And I could never date a guy who wears glasses because of the clown from my dreams.
The clown who wears glasses.
Oh, my God, that clown is me.
I'm not dating Robby, okay?
Hey.
Oh, Robby.
Oh, hey, Robby.
I heard my name a bunch of times. I mean, I could tell that you weren't trying to call me in here, but, uh, my curiosity kicked in, so... A couple of us are gonna wander down and, uh, you know, tell some stories and, uh... [plays guitar] sing a few songs.
That sounds great. Actually, you know who loves to sing?
Actually, I've really been hating music lately.
Come on, Jess, you're a whore for singin'. Please.

Nick, if this is about notes, so help me God.
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna stop bugging you until you note me, Schmidt.
All right, Nick. Here's a note.
Stop cutting yourself off at the knees like a selfish coward.
Okay, great, great. I love the direction we're going.
We're getting more critical, but can you refocus to the writing?
No, Nick, I cannot, and you want to know why?
Because you are a writer.
And a damn good one at that.
But you're just too scared to admit it to yourself.
Goodbye, sir.
No! Damn, you raven-haired dandy boy.
Yeah, thought carving our names in the trees would have taken longer.
Yeah.
[owl hooting]
So... do you want... want to have sex?
Yeah. I think that's... Yeah, let's...
Listen, Aly, I got to admit, I'm pretty tapped out.
I-I'm sorry to say it like that, but, you know, I'm...
No. Me, too! I know!
We've had too much sex too fast!
Why didn't we pace ourselves?
[sighs]
I'm so exhausted.
Oh, my gosh, I think this whole ordeal just illustrates why three months isn't three days.
So happy you said that.
[laughs]
I'm just happy to be in the same place as you.
Me, too.
And, you know, we did do it 13 times.
That's a lot.
That's a lot of times.
But you know what my favorite time was?
11? [laughs]
11. You knew.
Oh, I knew. 11 was great.
Mm. Maybe we should do 11 again.
But this time... I'm the mermaid.
Okay. I'm the mermaid.
[laughing]: No, I'm the mermaid.
Kind of, uh... Yeah, right there.
Perfect.
Get your butt down there.

I can't!
You can't what?
I can't ignore what's going on with Brenda and Hugh!
We weren't doing anything!
I hope you guys were behaving, all right?
Because you know what happens on strike two.
Strike two and...
Strike... You're not out on strike two, but, you know, strike two, you're on thin ice.
Jess should be on thin ice.
Ugh!
She took us on a couples trip!
Yeah, that's like taking alcoholics to a brewery!
Nobody here wants to hear from you, Hugh.
You Hugh.
You... Hugh.
You made us hang out with your lame couples friends!
How are we lame?
There is no reason to att*ck us.
And when singing Toto, why is it always "Africa"?
They've got a deep catalog!
Robby: Okay.
Look, I think we can all agree that Jess is a very important member of this group.
You hypocrite.
Before you cast aspersions on anyone else, you need to take a good long look at yourself, Robby!
The emperor I don't even know has no clothes!
.. why we bothered coming here!
[overlapping chatter]
And you sexualized Toto.
No, you make a good...
I know those guys. They're good guys!
Know what? Enough!
Okay, I'm not, uh...
Guys, I'm not actually gonna smash my guitar to get your attention.
But listen, I don't want you to lose faith in this group.
Okay? Just... lose faith in me.
Because you're right. I have been a hypocrite. Uh...
I do have feelings for Jess.
Ooh.
[gasps]
Just... he didn't say what kind of feelings.
They're sexual and romantic feelings.
Oh, wow.
Oh, boy.
Brenda: Well, what do you know?
I'm really sorry about last night. Where's the group?
The group is kind of permanently done.
Robby sent out a final e-mail.
It was in Latin, uh, and it was in this gothic font.
I'm kind of worried about him.
Why don't you give the guy a chance, Jess?
[sighs] I'm not interested right now.
So, what, are you just gonna give up on love, be alone forever? Like...
No, you know me.
I love love!
Anything in pairs makes me choked up.
Shoes, socks, chopsticks.
I'm just in kind of a confusing place right now, and I think you guys know why.
It's about Nick, right?
Yes, of course we are talking about Nick.
I knew it.
Yes, I'm talking about Nick.
I knew it.
I knew it.
But, look, I want you to know something.
I'm really, really happy being single right now.
I'm sorry if my group ruined your weekend.
They're really cool people if you get to know them.
I'm sure.
[phone chimes]
Yeah. Oh, my God, I have to go.
Foster got a corn chip in his eye.
Schmidt: Okay, you know what?
We need to make a pact to befriend at least one other married couple.
Yeah, but how are we gonna do that?
We don't have a kid, and I refuse to take cooking classes.
I don't know. Maybe we just go to a Norah Jones concert, stand outside and look lost.
Well, Schmidty, you pulled a real Mr. Miyagi on the whole "no notes, tough love" routine.
Let me see it.
Ooh! Nick, there's a whole nother chapter here!
How did you make this happen?
I worked... because of you. And... who is this wise, denim-clad Jewish chaplain?
Sch-Schmith?
That was the big thing.
You helped me realize that Pepperwood needed a Schmith.
Okay. While it's an honor to be included in the world that you've created here, um... [sighs] the Schmith character seems, uh, grotesque.
Yeah, he's unlikeable.
I don't understand why, when we meet this character, he-he's kicking a puppy.
He's the bad guy... in Pepperwood's life.
He's mean, he's...
He's not somebody you want to introduce to Mom and Dad.
The cha... the character.
Schmith is a dirt bag.
I have no respect for Schmith, and neither should anybody else.
I think that's a mistake to say those things about the character.
I appreciate what you're saying, but I'm happy with what I have.
I don't need any notes.
Oh, now it's no notes?!
Nick? Nick?!
Sit anywhere?
What's up, Robby?
Hey, sorry. I'll leave. I was almost done..
No! You'll ruin your food!
Yeah, just like I ruined the group.
You didn't ruin anything. We're...
We're still hanging out.
Really?
Okay, so could you guys vote me back in maybe?
We voted to get rid of voting.
It's the same, just, uh, without the rules.
Jess, I don't really know what to say.
Don't say anything.
It's fine. I'm just gonna read.
Um, Winston gave me a copy of Nick's book.
It's actually pretty good.
Um...
[laughing]
Except the foreword says, "Best enjoyed with shrimp cocktail." [laughs]
You can go back to your crossword puzzle.
It's a word search.
Oh.
Hey, Robby?
Hmm?
Should... should we just share a table?
Is that crazy?
I don't think it's crazy at all. Do you?
No. I mean, I suggested it, so, no.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, thanks.

You promised me if we had sex this morning, you wouldn't get riled up.
Sex was great. Blessings.
But look at all this mail.
Small-time drug dealers are more organized than this.
Oh, my God, my uncle Lee got married.
This is what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God, he d*ed.
Cece, what if that had been one of your college acceptance letters?
I'm transferring to a four year university.
It's no big deal.
It's huge.
You graduated from a community college.
It was a sight to behold.
[clears throat]
Cece Parikh.
That's me.
[air horn blares]
Yay!
I'm not gonna let you lose out because our roommates are a bunch of railway cats.
Clear your schedule. We're organizing.
Can't. I'm campaigning with Jess today.
Let's get ready to Rodham!
["Pump Up the Jam" by Technotronic plays]
Y'all ready for this... election?
[vocalizes]
What on Earth are you celebrating?
It's okay. We know you're voting for Trump.
Not on your life, nor am I voting for that flip-flopping helmet head in a pantsuit.
I'm only focused on one election.
The election that matters: Paul Ryan 2020.
Jess: All right.
While you sit this one out, Cece and I are gonna register new voters and help Hillary prove that a woman's place is in the house...
Both: The White House.
The people's voice must be heard and that's what I've always believed.
As I see it, we have two choices.
Continue eating this pig slop that they call butterscotch pudding or we can raise our voices and demand for locally-sourced, candied, Oregon apples!
[cheering]
You can silence me, but you can't silence the people!
This is not P.S. Hippie Montessori.
Nobody cares anymore.
Democracy is d*ad.
Wha...
If you get five new voters, hell, you know what, I'll vote for Hillary.
Excuse me?
Things... just... got... interesting.
But if you don't, you have to vote for Winston.
Bishop?
Winston Bishop?
Game on, you Republican minx.
Hey, guys, if I win, I just want you to know there will be some things that come out about me.
Just ride it out.
Reagan's in Seattle.
Aly's at Quantico.
And here we are, you and me, working that long "D".
The long what now?
We're working the what?
The long "D". Long distance relationships.
I mean, Aly and I have got it down to an art.
Really? 'Cause I'm...
I'm really struggling.
In New Orleans, Reagan and I had such an easy time talking, but now there's so much pressure that we just text.
Just talk on the phone.
I hate talking on the phone, Winston.
I feel like I'm exposing my turd pipe.
What?
I just know that I feel cold and I'm terrified.
Look, man... you got to understand something about the long "D".
At first, it's very hard.
Okay? It's a lot to take.
But the long "D" in the end is...
[chuckling] very much worth it.
You have to see what you're doing here.
Right now you're having problems.
I'm not. You know why?
'Cause you love the long "D".
I've adjusted to the long "D".
Okay.
Sometimes it's rough.
Yeah, can be bumpy road sometimes, man.
The long "D" can be bumpy.
Ooh!
Sometimes there's unexpected curves.
Don't I know it.
But once it breaks you down a little bit, you learn to like the long "D".
You're gonna say something like that?
You get used to it is what I'm saying.
I think I'm done with this.
[Cece chuckles]
Hello.
Jess: Hello.
Two canvassers reporting for duty.
Jessica Day, school administrator. Cecilia Parikh, community college graduate, soon to be transferred to a four year university.
I don't have time for this. Well, actually...
She doesn't know which one yet.
Yeah, I haven't been accepted.
I don't have time to listen to you.
Sure. Oh, no.
Just be respectful, informative.
Hillary Clinton was born in 1947 and her parents are Hugh and Dorothy.
Woman won a Grammy.
That's a fact.
Both: Takes a village.
Try phone duty.
Great.
Quick question.
I've perfected five different, assertive, female voices.
You tell me which one you'd like me to use.
[high-pitched]: Hi. [in a deep voice]: Hey.
Hello. [in a British accent]: Good day.
[in a deep voice]: 'Sup. That was one.
What is so genius about the new system is that it's completely self-explanatory.
Now, let's say you get a heating bill.
Where does it go?
Oh. [chuckles]
Didn't know I was gonna be quizzed.
Loft bills.
That's right.
And do not put that in the old mail, soy sauce, d*ad battery drawer.
Wh...
What?
What?
What is this drawer?
Take me to the drawer, Winston.
Where is it?
[gasps dramatically]
I didn't...
The hell is this?
Uh... some... some of everything.
When you cut the belly open of a shark and just everything topples out.
Have you people all just given up?
Well, hang on.
It's Cal State L.A.
This is Cece's first admissions letter.
Oh.
I got to get this to her.
Winston! I hope you're happy!
I showed her my turd pipe.
I don't know what's going on in your lives, but we need to start eating dinner together again.
Mm-mm.
Oh.
You got in my head.
I decided to call Reagan and it went horribly.
Hi, this is Nick.
Yeah, Nick Miller, boyfriend. Boyfriend.
[imitating Southern accent]: What you got?
Why am I talking this way? Hi.
Talking, me talking.
You listening, you listening.
[talking incoherently]
Next thing I knew, I was saying the words "phone" and "sex" and now she expects phone sex.
Nick, relax, man.
Help me.
I'm screwed, Winston. I'm gonna lose her.
My friend, you are not gonna lose her, okay?
Phone sex is old school.
That's how our nanas got nasty.
True, true, true.
They'd be like, "What you wearing, Gertrude?"
She'd be like, "My bloom... bloomers.
Pull down those trousers and let me see that thing."
[chuckles] But... thanks to technology, hmm, there's plenty other ways you can get sensual with your lady.
Welcome... to the Winston Bishop Clinic for Satellite Sexual Intercourse.
Eh?
This is how you do phone sex?
Video sex, Nick.
Aloha. Beautiful girl on a beautiful day in Hawaii.
Ooh.
Let's make love for the Japanese b*mb.
Oh, my God!
They're b*mb us! No!
No!
You know we share a wall, right?
Mm...
On envelopes. Really? Ugh.
We are not making a damn diff in here, Cece.
Stuffing paper.
If ten-year-old Jess could see me now...
You know, she'd be really proud of your knockers.
I never saw that coming.
Well, that's a fair point.
I did exceed expectations.
Mm.
But you know what?
We need to get off the bench and we need to go prove Schmidt wrong.
So, we need a list of potential new voters and I know just the tired, cranky broad who has one.
Hey.
Thought you could use a hot cup.
So, when the dust settles, what's, uh... what's next for the supervisor?
My name is Mary Ellen and I haven't thought about myself in weeks.
Oh, well, best of luck.
Piece of cake, Cece.
Sign up five new voters. We'll be done by noon.
Yes! Yes!
Hi, do you have a minute to talk about Hillary?
I'm voting for her.
Would you like to...
Hillary Cli...
Yes?
[chuckles]
You know who you look like?
I am not Bernie Sanders.
I am Marshall Stevens and for the last year and a half, my life has been a living hell!
[door slams]
Okay.
So, this is what all the kids are talking about these days?
Yep. Yeah.
Video sex?
Do you clean this thing regularly?
I thi...
Why are you looking up?
[phone chiming]
That's her. She wants to do it now.
[whooping] I like her style.
A little afternoon delight.
Yeah. Okay, let's pick out a backdrop.
Where do you want to get naughty?
Paris? Rome?
Huh? Drink a little tea?
That's not sexy.
Afric... nah, you don't want to...
Outer space?
You can do it in space?
Oh, yes, Nick.
You can.
And you will.
Jess: Wait. This is a sorority house.
It's probably a house full of unregistered voters.
I hear you, I do, but there's nothing scarier to me than sorority girls.
Hey, you got the keg? 'Cause we're almost tapped and I'm like, "What?"
[clears throat] Um, are you ladies planning to vote?
Yeah, bye.
[door closes]
Is she gone?
[phone buzzing]
I stood frozen like you're supposed to when you see a bear in the woods.
Hold on a sec. Hey, babe.
Where are you? I'm...
I'm at the Phish concert that you call a campaign office.
And I have your first admissions letter!
We're just actually out canvassing right now.
I'll open it when I get home.
That's not gonna work for me. I'm gonna open it now.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, don't...
Sorry. I can't hear you over the sound of me opening it.
You got into college!
You got into college!
I got into college.
You got into college?
[chuckling]
Cece got into college. Congratulations.
Ah, whatever.
[whispering]: Don't tell Schmidt we haven't gotten any new voters.
Tell Jess that I'm not surprised, Okay.
And her whispers are like screams.
Hey!
Whoa. All right.
The day's not done.
Money and special interests, Jess.
Let me hear you say it: democracy is d*ad.
Democracy is... alive.
He got where I was going.
Whew.
Let's find you a home.
Thank you.
Oh.
Supervisor: Uh, we lost a couple of deadbeats over in envelopes. We need you there.
I'm not one of you people.
I'm very sorry. I'm a Repu... Hmm.
I'm repulsed by that garbage dump you call an envelope station.
Great. Then organize it.
No.
[phones ringing]
[singsongy]: I'm-a make a system.
I couldn't see the smug look on Schmidt's face, but I could feel it.
I'll be damned if I cast a vote for Bishop-Furguson.
Wait, where-where are you going?
Back to the coven of Greek sirens.
I say we go in hard, with the violent history of the suffragette, and then, we ease into some light reproductive rights.
That is one way to do it.
Or...
Who's ready to party?
And gab about the kind of world we want to leave our grandchildren!
Hopefully one that's full of parties!
[cheering]
You're gonna graduate soon, okay?
So, this is your turn to really speak up and make a difference...
And it's your turn to drink!
Oh, okay. All right, just, um, okay...
I love you, booze girl. Take a sh*t!
Oh, no. I don't...
sh*t!
I don't want to take a sh*t, but I do want you to sign up to vote.
I can't sign it if you don't take a sh*t.
That's such a good argument. Okay.
[sighs] Oh...
All right.
You all have ten sh*ts and I have one.
But, if you share the wealth, then we can all throw up together.
And that's called redistribution.
[cheering]
That's what I'm saying!
Ah, you're welcome! [laughs]
[all chanting]: Booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl...
Oh, bingo.
I feel sexy.
Can I, uh, practice some sex talk I've been working on?
Pretend you're Reagan.
[exhales]
Take off your space pants, I want to do sex with you over this video thing.
Don't overthink it.
Okay...
I can't see anything in here, but... here goes nothing.
[phone ringing]
In ten hours, I'll be d*ad.
I'm headed straight to the sun, which is actually a star.
But it's our star.
And it's worth saving.
Nick?
Anyway... here's my penis.
Oh! [screams]
Nick, put it...
Nick, what are you doing?
[yelling] No! No!
Where's Winston?
This is my nightmare!
[Aly screams]
Face your fears, Nick! Talk to Reagan!
It's not Reagan, it's Aly. Let me out!
No, no. Aly? Don't look! Close your eyes!
[Nick and Winston yelling]
Aly: Is that a comet? What...
Oh, wow!
Look at me, baby. Look at me.
I feel like I should tell you, I saw the whole thing.
Schmidt: One, two, three.
Stuff.
Jenise, we just... We don't touch this pile.
We touch those piles.
Thank you. 'Lopes!
Excellent.
What are you doing here?
You're interrupting.
I like your work, new guy.
I need you on the phones.
What about my 'lopes?
Nope. Phones.
Just read the script.
Okay, fine. But only one call.
That's it. And then I'm taking my talents back to mailers.
Yes, hello.
I'm calling to remind you to vote for a better America and a vote for a better America is a vote for Hubbedy Bubbedy.
Hillary Clinton.
That's what I said. Hibiddy Bibbidy.
It's Hillary.
Yes, I know.
Hillary Clinton!
And I keep saying that. Okay?
Hubbedy Barry.

Mm-hmm.
Excuse me, would you like to talk about...
Oh, my God!
Jessica?
Cece!
Jessica?
Oh...
I feel like I haven't seen you in so long.
Like, in years.
You look friggin' amazing!
Shut up!
Truly, like, the best I've ever seen you.
Shut up, Keep doing whatever you are doing.

One of them threw herself in front of a horse.
A horse!
Jess, come down, okay? You're drunk, they're all drunk.
I'm drunk.
We lost the bet.
This is not about the bet, this is about America!

Now, you ladies can sit on the sidelines and let someone else dictate your futures, or you can speak up and take charge of your lives.

Hey, buddy, we doing all right?
Yeah, never better.
Aly saw my ass in space, Reagan still wants to have phone sex with me, and I just panic-ordered $200 worth of Chinese food.
You know what, man? That's on me, I...
I pushed you to use my style when I should have encouraged you to use your own.
Winston, if I had any style, I would call my girlfriend instead of using my best friend's electronic sex shed.
"Every moment you're on this Earth, is a moment I know where you are."
You know who wrote that?
The great James Baldwin.
No, you wr... James Baldwin?
What?
Look, man, you sent me these cards when I was playing basketball in Latvia.
And, I don't know, I kept all of them.
They're beautiful, man.
"I screamed your name at the ocean today, then I ate a sandwich that tasted like your smile."
I wrote that to you? Yeah.
Boy, we used to be a lot closer.
This is your style, man.
Use it.
Thank you.
Hey, uh, Reagan, this is Nick Miller.
You said you wanted phone sex, so, here you go.
Here's your phone sex.
Get ready to, uh, have a... an orgasm, I guess.
When I'm done with, uh... I'll just start.
You are a real sandwich lady, and I want to scream your name across the ocean.
Winston: Ooh, hoo!
That's nice.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's that's Winston.
Yeah, he's in here to help, he's actually been very helpful.
What's up, girl?
He says "What's up, girl?"
Oh, yeah, I'll def... Yeah, makes perfect sense.
You need to leave right now.
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Bye, Reagan.
No, Winston, I mean it. She brings up a valid point.
We're about to do phone sex, and...
I'm walking out...
All right, Winston, take off.
Sure. For sure.
No, Winston, I mean it.
This is me telling you as Nick.
I would like you to leave.
As Nick. Ooh!

Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

No.

Let's go. Come on, let's go.
Are we going in the right direction?
Doesn't matter. Keep running.
I mean, you helped those girls find their voice, you know, it just... wasn't the one that you wanted.
You helped me find my voice, too.
I'm not sure you're gonna want to hear that one either.
What do you mean?
I don't want to go to college.
What?
When Schmidt opened my letter, I could hear the excitement in his voice, and I could see it in your face, but...
Cece...
I felt nothing.
Schmidt, please talk some sense to your wife.
She says she doesn't want to go to college, but tell her that a four-year education...
No, okay, look, Jess, Jess, I know school is your life, okay, and I respect that, you know that I do, but we're different people.
I don't want to be stuck in a classroom.
I want to be out in the world working with people.
I just really need you both to support me.
I support you. I will always support you.
I mean, this sort of ruins my dream of... taking you in a dorm room, but...
A dorm room?
Did you think I was gonna move out?
I thought...

I want what's best for you, so if this is what you want...
It is. Trust me.
Booze girl loves you.
Oh, I love you, booze girl.

This is a memento from a dark period.
Hey, Winston, I lost the bet.
I'm gonna be voting for you.

Well, first of all, I just want to say that my portrait, it will be silly.

I can't tell her that you fired her little sister.
This is a delicate situation for our relationship.
Please, Jess.
Why are you ask... why are you asking Jess?
And, Jess, why are you inserting yourself into this?
If anyone's inserting themself, it's Winston.
He's like a tongue at a seventh grade birthday party.
Okay, look, fine, can I at least be the one to break the news to her?
Yes, you may.
Thank you, Jess.
It is so great to know.
Yeah. who your real friends are.
Yeah.
Get off the sofa.
Yeah.
Go check on your cat.
Look, we'll find a place, okay?
I didn't like that house that much anyway.
I just can't be married, living with roommates.
Well, hey!
Well, I hope you saved some for Furguson.
[singsongy]: 'Cause you forgot yesterday.
[chuckles]
No!
[screams]
[screaming]
No!
Look at our wedding photo.
I want to hang our wedding photo in our house.
I want to start our lives together.
I know.
Guys, we are in this together.
We're just gonna have to find a house ourselves.
I need a project now that my table's almost done.
I'll be your real estate agent.
I've already found, like, five open houses today.
Like, this one is a fixer-upper, but don't judge a house by its smoke damage.
Okay, babe, this was a crime scene.
Yeah, but that was months ago.
And it was drug thing, so there are no ghosts.
That's not how ghosts work.
This is in your price range, and it's, like, only five minutes from the loft.
I really think this is the best investment of our money right now.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Hey, babe?
[groans]
I think we got this, okay?
Yes.
We got this.
Actually, we, we got this.
Preach! We got this.
Jess, look at us for a second, the two of us, Cece and I.
We. Us.
Both: We got this.
We got this.
[chuckles]: All right.
Schmidt, bedrooms. Cece, bathrooms.
I'm gonna smell everything.
Bonjour! Crawdaddy's home, and he's ready to see his crawkids!
Who's home?
Schmidty, Jess?
Winston?
Winston's cat?
Fine. Cece?
♪
The en suite is en fleek.
I love this house, too.
I poked my head in the shower.
Perfect, gentle, unrelenting pressure.
Like when my mom made me rehearse my haftarah portion.
I don't know, guys.
Lot of lost dog posters around.
Really sad neighborhood.
Also it's crazy expensive.
I'm the voice of reason, that's why you brought me with.
We-we didn't bring you with.
You followed us here in your car.
Okay.
She followed us the whole way.
I know, I know.
Cece, I'm begging you, please tell her to go home.
Yeah, I know.
We need to start setting some boundaries.
You know what, though? She's not wrong.
This place is way over our borrowing limit.
Damn it. [Sighs]
The only place that was even close was that...
Both: Carpet house.
All right. We will ask for a bigger loan.
And It'll be tight, but we'll manage it.
Okay.
Yeah, we can do it.
Look, we'll just make sacrifices.
Yeah.
We'll pack our lunches.
We'll cut out cup-on's.
It's coupons.
Cup-ons, yeah.
No, you're saying cup-ons.
Well, it's fine.
It's not important, we'll cut out cup-ons.
Coupons.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to go to the bank now because this house is gonna go like this, I know it.
Why is she talking to the realtor?
I will handle it, okay?
It's-it's tot... it's... Oh.
Jess?
I'm so sorry, do you mind if I just steal her away for a minute? Jessica?
Hey, honey, this can't happen.
You're right, this is not your house.
Toni-Anne, we're walking!
No, no.
You being here.
You taking over as our real estate agent because... you can't stop thinking about Nick.
Cece, not everything's about Nick.
Curvando diante da face errada.
In Portuguese, "You're bending before the wrong face."
Again, very sexual language.
You know I love you and I will always be there for you in an emergency, but Schmidt and I need to do this by ourselves.
You got to go home.
Okay. I got it. Okay.
You guys are moving forward, You don't need ol' Jess the Mess.
I'm gonna go home.
But seriously, I crawled under the house and the retrofitting is rookie work.
Okay.
She going home?
Yeah, let's go to the bank.
Let's do it. You know what, actually, I just want to use the cooktop first.
Make an egg.
Honey, where are you gonna get an egg?
Got two eggs right here.
Got a pan right here.
Think I'm gonna buy a house and not make an egg first?
And I'm a Sagittarius, which is why I'm so good with people and horses.
But it also makes me, like, really sleepy.
Uh, Leslie... [nervous laugh]
Um, there's no... there's no easy way to say this.
Uh... you... no longer work... for Schmidt and Cece.
No, no, they're f*ring me?
No, but didn't you tell them how good I am?
Well, you know, I tried to.
I was like, I was like, "Man, she good..."
You didn't stick up for me, Winston?
Well, I tried...
I'm calling Aly!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, no, no, time out, time out.
Listen, hey, hey, hey.
Time out. Stop.
Stop that. You didn't let me finish.
You don't work for Schmidt and Cece anymore, because...
'Cause you work for me now.
I'm buying a house.
[Shrieks happily]
I'm buying a house!
[Laughing]
Ha, ha! I'm buying a home.
[horns honking]
We do not look great on paper.
Please, on paper, we're as ugly as Winston's bellybutton ring.
Who gets a bellybutton ring if you have an outie?
And at 33, no less.
But trust me, loan officers have a lot of discretion.
We just need to market ourselves.
We need to look him right in the eye...
Mr. Schmidt and Mrs. Parikh?
I'm not blind.
I just had my pupils dilated for an exam.
If it makes you feel any better, I'm seeing stars, too.
What?
I'm talking about you.
Okay, honey, just... shh.
Shh. You're a big, bright star.
It ain't gonna be that kind of party today, pal.
Follow me.
[exhales]
Nick [muffled]: Hey, Crawdaddy's home!
[coughs]
I had a whole crawdaddy thing, but I... the point is, I'm home.
[clears throat]
Hey, Nick.
You weren't supposed to be home for, like, a month.
Are you guys doing okay?
Yeah, uh, Reagan's drug company is moving her up to Seattle...
Okay. so we're doing the distance thing.
Yeah, we're doing great.
You know what they call Seattle in Portland?
North Portland.
Or, uh, Vancouver's Shoe.
What?
Vancouver's Shoe.
[chuckles]
Get in here!
Give me a hug!
Okay.
All right!
Wow, look at you.
You got jacked. Yeah.
What, did you go to prison?
[chuckles]
[laughs] No.
I worked out a lot.
Come on, sit down.
I haven't seen you in months.
I need some Jess.
I also have something very important to tell you.
Is everything okay?
Um...
I have to, um...
It's just, I have to meet my friend.
I mean, I have to go to the zoo.
The zoo? You hate zoos.
Um, I was supposed to meet her in the lemur section of the parking lot like ten minutes ago, so...
What friend?
Why...? Deedee.
I have to meet Deedee.
She's, like, a good friend.
"Deedee"?
That's not a name.
You have one friend. It's Cece.
This sounds fishy.
Yeah, no.
We can't loan you any more money.
Jess [whispering]: Cece!
Oh. Okay. What?
No, I... I-I know what this is about.
I'll just be a moment.
You know what what's...
Thank you.
Ce... ce...
What's happening?
What is happening?
Jessica...
You said "emergency."
Well, this is an emergency.
Nick is home.
What is your emergency?
Don't glory in it, Cece.
Please don't mistake my measured bank tone for calmness, as I am filled with the waters of rage.
Jess, I know that you've come here to convince Cece that she shouldn't buy this house.
No.
Babe, this is an emergency.
I have feelings for Nick again, okay?
There. I said it.
[sighs]
I saw him for one second and I freaked out.
I told him I was going to the zoo.
Both: You hate the zoo.
There's something about him.
I see him and my heart explodes.
We all need to meet new people.
Oh...
[seagulls squawking]
Where are we?
Your new hood!
Okay, so, I couldn't check all the boxes, but I think nailed the most important one: That it can float.
That's a... that's a boat.
Yeah.
I was just driving to my doctor's office last night and I saw it.
And you thought, "Okay."
Where-where's your doctor's office?
Three boats down.
Should we call Aly and tell her the good news?
I had no idea you were going through this.
I can't even be in the same room as Nick.
I don't know what I'm saying and what if I say something that ruins our friendship?
Get out.
What?
Get out. Get out right now.
Get out instantly.
What?
What happened to the "I'm so sorry"?
Nick is on his way to the bank right now. I texted him.
I need his help with the loan.
What?
What?
We need to put the bar up for collateral, okay?
We're miles past our borrowing limit. It's the only way.
Yeah, but the bar?
No time. There he is.
What?
Schmidt: Hey, Nick!
Ah!
[laughing]
Just pretend like we're having a normal conversation.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Okay. Um...
This is, um, this is Margaret.
This is Gracie.
Oh. No. You think I...
Oh, no.
I'm not a bank robber.
Stop reaching for that button.
I'm just trying to avoid my ex.
Oh, thank God.
God, I missed you.
You know, I slept in your bed twice.
Look at your hair, you hippie.
Yeah, just come over here! Great!
Um, oh. Uh, heads up.
There are over 60 pairs of shoes in your room.
Uh, heads up, they're all in the hallway now.
Oh, okay.
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.
This is my co-signer.
[sighs]
Nick: Point me in any direction and I'll sign.
[chuckles]
So this is the place, eh?
Beautiful picture of it.
That's how much it is?
That's really exp...
Schmidty, are you sure you know what you're getting us into?
Yeah, man.
All right.
[Cece giggles]
Congrats.
Did we get the loan?
I wish it were up to me, because the answer would be "no" and all of this would be over.
He's been a buzzkill all day.
Yeah. That's all right.
I owe you one American dream...
[laughs]
You sweet angel.
We did it!
I'm so happy for you guys.
Hey, I gotta go.

[exhales] This is stupid.
I can't keep hiding from him.
Jess, just give me a sec, okay?
No, Cece... Cece, it's fine.
I'll come back with you.
Go... go with Jess now.
No, no, no, no.
I have to do this myself.
And you guys have to buy a house.
This is good; This is you moving forward.
Thanks, Jess.
Get in here.
Oh, I love you guys.
Okay.
[grunts]
Oh... Oh, my God.
[laughs]
Lost my breath, there.
She's a strong... strong one.
Well, you're getting the loan.
What?
Interest rates are about to drop and we want to settle you with a high one before they do, so...
We got the loan?
We can make an offer?
[laughing]: It doesn't make a lick of sense to me, but there you go.
So many zeros.
That's a lot of zeros.
What are you doing?
Winston: Hella?
Are you buying a boat?
[sighs]
Look, it is a complicated situation.
First off, I think your sister is amazing.
Secondly, I know that we just went long-distance and I don't want to give you any bad news, but... your sister ain't that good at her job.
Like, at all.
She's... uh, dumb.
That girl is the trunk of a tree.
Ain't nobody at home up here.
Okay, you...
She a cottonhead!
Easy...
This girl is a dumped-out sewing kit.
Easy.
She talkin', but ain't nobody listenin'.
Easy. That's my sister.
And I know she's an idiot.
[exhales] Thank God.
Just because we're long-distance doesn't mean we can't be real with each other.
Okay?
We have to tell each other everything.
[sighs]
I don't know what the word "panache" means.
It means having a certain kind of flair.

What?
By hand. Yes.
Unfortunately, it all blew into the Mississippi River.
Oh, my God, no. That's terrible.
I mean, for you and for the environment...
And I had to start over, so I invested in a computer...
I bought the heaviest one I could find... and look... heavy computers, heavy materiel.
This is my first book.
What?
Yeah.
This is what I wanted to tell you.
Oh, my God.
[laughing]: It's my book!
Nick, how many days did it take to print this out?
About a week. I had to go to a car rental place at night, but, uh... read the first page.
"To Anthony Rizzo and the Chicago Cubs, for all we've been through."
"And to my friend Jessica Day... for the same thing."
I don't know if you remember this, but, uh... you were the one who told me to go to New Orleans.
So thank you.
You're welcome.

Yeah, I think that's a "W," "W-R."
Do you ever feel, deep down, that you know at some point you're gonna have a stroke and it's gonna be really bad?
Jess...
I have some Honduran matrimony beads for my son.
Where's Schmidt?
Jess [whispering]: Winston.
Winston.
I cannot believe I'm asking this... but I need you to prank this wedding.
Please.
Please, we need to distract people.
He's a serious man now.
He doesn't prank anymore.
Just look at his eyes.
All the mischief's gone.
If this were another time, another day, hell, even six hours ago...
Listen to me, you bird-shirted, puzzle baby.
You get out there and you do something totally idiotic right now!
[May and Coach laugh]
Funston, we have a pranklem.
[laughs]
I'm not good at these.
It's a weird one.
Okay... update.
The vibe's getting ugly.
People are getting dangerously drunk.
I found a loose EpiPen on the floor, which can't be good.
I think we're gonna have to start telling people that Schmidt's... on a plane.
Or not. Don't freak out.
Mom?
Schmidt's on a plane?
Mom, what are you doing here?
If you've come to object to this wedding, you are too late, and in another sense, because it's delayed, you're... too early.
That's not at all why I'm here.
Schmidt: Mama P. Schmidt with the latest, "Why I Love Cece." Today's episode: Honesty with a Capital Ouch. He called you?
Every Monday for the past year.
[beeps] Your daughter is the best thing...
[beeps] I just lost a fight in the desert, but...
[beeps] And I want her to be the last thing I see when she pulls the plug.
[beeps] But it's not an A-plus unless we both finish. [Beeps]
She's so beautiful.
The odds are really stacked against our children.
They're not all winners.
[beeps] I just know that if you miss your daughter's wedding, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.
I am delighted for you to marry this man.
Flight attendant: For those keeping score with row five, Cece's mom is at the wedding!
[cheering, laughter]
[cheering continues]
Just get here when you can, okay?
We'll wait until you do.
You know what? Have the party without me.
Babe.
No. Okay, no.
Have the party. We'll...
We'll get married at City Hall with all the immigrants and liberals and first cousins.
Your whole life has been about this party.
My whole life is you.
Plus, my cousin Nathan is just dying for something to go wrong.
I'm so happy.
I have an idea.
Conga!

Marriage is about s...
I imagined that differently.
You're okay. You're okay. Pull it together.
Just let the index cards go.
Speak from the heart.
You know who I'm talking to when I say you were rude to me earlier at the bar.
And now who's in control? I could point to you and call you out, but I won't.
When I first met this guy, Schmidt, I thought, "I'm not gonna be friends with him."
I don't like his personality."
Magic's fake.
[guests murmuring]
Believe what you want, but I want you guys to think about something, and now this is off the jack.
In a couple generations, we're all gonna be d*ad, and no one's gonna remember any of us.
I mean, think about it. Do you remember your great-great grandparents or... or their parents, or what they did day to day?
The point is, it doesn't matter.
Everyone you know will be d*ad.
That's right.
Congratulations, man. I love you.
Best friends.
That's my time, everybody. Thank you.
Look, if it made sense, it wouldn't be my wedding.
Your speech wasn't that bad.
My speech was fantastic.
It's the best 17 minutes of my life.
I really opened up my heart.
I was gonna say.
Nah, I'm just feeling bad about Reagan.
I think I came on too strong, or-or...
I don't know. She told me she's leaving tonight on a train.
On a train? Where's she going, Hogwarts?
No, San Diego.
I don't know if "Hog-warts" is near San Diego.
I've never heard of it.
Never mind.
But, I mean, it's okay. I just, I feel like I, you know...
I just got excited for a second.
Nick, she came here to see you.
I bet you're reading into it. What if I go talk to her?
Talk me up a little bit?
Woman to woman?
That's implied.
Winston.
Winston: No hay Weenstons. It's ocupados.
Winston, I know you're in there 'cause I'm looking at a picture of your butt cheeks right now.
Oh, that's a working class butt.
Nothing wrong with that!
Mm.
Give me...
Give me those.
That's a fatty. You got a fatty.
This is not Winnie's day.
Ernie, give him your jacket.
What?
Give me the damn jacket.
All right, here, dude.
I jabbed my giblets in the breast pocket. Tie it around your waist.
Then that leaves the front porch open or the back.
I don't think this is gonna work.
I'll just sit here cold and naked while my best friend gets married.
Look, you were right, Coach.
I'm not a serious man. I'm a nude, apple bottom, long-fronted dumb-ass.
Ooh, look. At least you can change the background. Look.
Now I'm in the Oval Office. That's crazy. [Camera shutter clicks]
Winston, you're a groomsman and a bridesman.
It doesn't get more serious than that.
You can't miss this wedding.
But what am I supposed to wear?
I am looking for the groom.

So, I mean, I feel like I really put myself out there, right?
I got on a plane, and I flew across the country to see him.
I couldn't get him out of my head, you know?
Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah.
And then he says the word "relationship," and I freaked out, because... [chuckles]
You know what, I don't know. Am I crazy to want a relationship with Nick?
I mean, you guys were together. What happened?
We were kind of a mess.
I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.
And... he wanted me to not care about those things.
That's not so bad. I mean, who really has a plan for their life?
[chuckles] Who does that?

Me. I d... I did it.
I do it. I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there who keep a very traditional banking account. Yeah.

She wants to do this.
Well, that's awesome. Congratulations.
Yeah, I'm freaking out. I can't believe it.
I mean, why does she want to be with me?
It doesn't make any sense.
You of all people know that I'm just the weird detour you take before you find the guy you want to be with.

So nice of your mom to get us this trip.
Much better than my dad's gift of weed gummy bears.
[laughs]
[both sigh heavily]
Aah! What the hell is happening?!
What?! What is happening?!
No! No!
Ha-ha! Happy honeymoon!
Winston!
[laughs]
How long has he been in there?
It's gonna ruin the whole freaking vacation!
Winston: Honeymoon prank!
What are you all drinking?
Ye!
Tran.
Great lasagna, it was fantastic.
Now you're fishing.
It was just good, and you know it.
You used the cheap cheese, and that was your mistake.
Great noodles, though.
Thank you. Bye.
We care about you.
Mm-hmm.
We did it!
Yes, we did it!
Winston: We did it.
Best rehearsal dinner ever.
You guys are a good team.
We haven't slept all week, but thanks.
I work in hospitality, it's what I do.
[Jess chuckles] I've got some cools things for tomorrow I want to show you.
Right on.
Maid of honor.
[Gasps]
Best Man.
Mayday J-Day.
What's up, Nick-knack.
We're gonna need some more hotties on the dance floor.
Copy that.
I'll get those hotties right over to you.
[Both laugh]
Awesome.
Thank you for letting us stay in your room.
Of course.
I'm sorry your mother's not coming, Cece.
Her disapproval of my son fills me with a hot rage.
I've repressed into a cyst on my back.
It's grotesque.
Sweet dreams, kid.
Night, Mom.
Good night, my mom's friend Susan.
Are you guys sure that you don't want to use the air mattress?
We sleep together.
We've been lovers since 1998.
[Laughs]
I want to thank everyone for an amazing rehearsal dinner.
Special shout out to Winston For a shockingly good toast.
[All applaud]
Winston!
Insanely good.
Dipping in and out of French.
Powerful stuff, man.
Yay!
No.
Blessings, blessings on all your households.
All right, I think it's time to get the bride and the groom to sleep in separate beds like boy cousins.
Wait, wait, can we just say good night first?
[Whispers]: We'll allow it.
[Normal voice]: We'll allow it.
[Moaning softly]
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna do the dishes. Dishes.
Break it up!
What is this?
The last night of drama camp?
Enjoy it while you can because it gets boring.
Same old lips year after year with no spark, just d*ad tongues touching, like decayed salmon.
Oh, my god, Winston!
I did it!
The night before the wedding, A bride is bound to feel a little bit emotional, so nervous? I got Xanax.
Delicious.
Mm-hmm.
Sad, I have a picture of a cat riding a dog like a horse.
[Both chuckle]
[Jess continues chuckling]
Is that for me or for you?
What?
Hmm.
You freak out, you want to escape to Canada?
I've got our passports and...
Trudeau pics. [Whistles]
I'm good, you know? I don't need anything.
Really? 'Cause you can ask for anything.
After tomorrow, you're not gonna be able to use the bride card anymore.
You've got power.
[Deep voice]: Wield it.
I'm gonna go crazy doing this For you one day.
Well, Sam is the most objectively marry-able guy I've ever dated.
He's out there washing dishes right now.
Mm.
And he's so tall.
So tall.
His jacket on me looks like a garbage bag.
Check it out.
Oh.
Uh...
[Quietly]: What is this?
[Gasps]
What? What? What?
[Loud Gasp]
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Is Sam gonna propose?
Oh, my god.
[Gasps] Oh, my god!
Nick, let me tell you something. It has been a pleasure watching you blossom into the best man.
Well, thank you for giving me the soil to grow.
Good night.
My flash drive is gone!
The flash drive your vows are on?!
No, a different flash drive!
Then what's the problem?
I was being sarcastic!
Of course the flash drive that my vows are on!
Ah...
There's my poet's fuel.
Mm, I might still be drunk from my own toast, but my god, you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday.
[Inhales deeply]
Bye.
Uh...
I'm here. I heard it.
Let's acknowledge that and, uh, you know where to find me.
It's not here. I can't find it.
I told Aly she'd make a beautiful bride someday, and then she just bounced.
I mean, why'd I say that?
We've been dating a month.
Dude, Schmidt lost his vows!
For the wedding?!
No, different vows.
Oh, so then what's the big deal?
What is wrong with you people?!
How'd I lose it?
I wear it around my neck. I even we...
I even wear it when I got a spray tan.
Winston: Ooh.
I think I know what happened.
What?
[Groans]
Is that a piece of my flash drive?
Yes, it is.
You see, earlier tonight, when we were practicing the hora...
Winston, stop trying to throw me off the chair!
That's not the game!
[All cheering]
I don't mean this anti-jewish at all, But that insane Jew dance has ruined our lives.
I'm freaking out.
It took me nine months to write those vows.
What do you remember?
Cece...
I can't believe this day is finally here.
And then...
Rick Santorum said it best when...
[Sighs] I don't... that's all I got. That's all I remember.
That's all you remember?!
My vows were like a novel.
How much of your zombie novel do you remember?
Chapter one...
"on Jack Granger's 41st birthday, he was sh*t in the face by his dog Ed."
Understand the situation that I'm in.
You are so lucky.
How-how am I lucky, Nick?
'Cause one of the greatest writers of our time is about to enter this room.
Would you like to meet him?
All right.
I'll go get him.
There's no way it's not him, right?
You think it's him?
It's me.
You know what, just 'cause he has a ring doesn't mean he's gonna propose to me tonight or right now.
[Knocking]
Hey, guys. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Uh, Jess, I have something important I want to talk to you about when you get a chance.
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.
Cool PJ's.
I look like the sky.
[Both chuckle softly]
Okay.
[Whisper screaming]
This is happening now. He is going to propose.
I totally didn't see this coming.
This is great, right?
[Brightly]: Yeah.
What was that?
What was what?
You paused.
[Laughs]: I didn't pause.
You took like a huge pause.
You were like...
Longer than that!
Jess...
What aren't you saying? That's what I'm asking.
Nothing... if you want to marry Sam, I want you to!
[Gasps] You think this is a horrible idea!
You know what the truth is?
I think that you paused on the inside.
Boom.
Don't you boom me.
I boom.
First of all, neither of us should want to say boom.
That's not ever a cool thing to say.
I'll decide who says boom!
To write anything, you need to start with a big idea.
In my last Zombie novel, Uh-oh Guts, the big idea was that there were too many guts.
[Chuckles] Schmidt, you're gonna say the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Cece.
Okay.
Cece...
Uh, what a...
You're too inside the thing. I-it's not that hard.
Watch me do it.
Ooh, now we getting somewhere.
Here we go. Winnie the Bish, when you feel ready just say her name.
Her name.
I'm gonna need you to say, "Cece."
Okay, this is not working.
Cece.
Cece... Average worker.
Uneducated, but kind.
Wears shoes, boyish...
Never really talked to her.
I don't know why I'm listening to you In the first place.
You're terrible at talking to women.
Case in point: You and Reagan.
Hey, did you clean everywhere?
Are you happy?
Are you happy that you said that?
I'd like to smell your towel.
Back to the basics, Schmidt.
Okay, there's only seven types of stories.
Please, don't list them.
Nick: I'm gonna list them.
Man vs. Man, Man vs. Dog, Dog vs. Zombie, James bond, stories of kings and lords, women over 50 finding themselves after divorce, and car commercial.
My favorite is, uh, that Toyota, Uh... Ev-every... the family's in the car...
You're thinking of the food commercial.
Really? Fat boy talks to idiot.
Okay, eight, fat boy talks to idiot.
We're getting nowhere. Winston, I need some of that toast magic.
What do you got?
I'm sorry, but I'm done speaking from the heart. I...
Basically ruined my love life today.
Here's my advice to you.
Okay.
Keep your guard up.
Don't be too vulnerable around her.
What?
Be standoff-ish, close yourself.
When she looks at you, cross your arms.
Turn your back on her.
Whoa, whoa.
For wedding vows, that's terrible advice.
Yeah... I get it, But you don't really, like, know how she feels.
Did I do it?
[Laughs]
Did he do it?
[Laughs]
[All laughing]
Okay...
All right.
You're welcome.
[Laughing]
[all laughing]
That was terrible, Winston!
Slow down, take a breath, Why don't we just talk about it and figure out what you want?
No, that's what I always do.
I talk and I talk.
Not this time.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...
Push through the panic And I'm gonna...
Say yes.
[Gasps] Really?
I'm gonna go get proposed to.
Okay, look, well, if you start freaking out and you need anything, just holler, okay?
I will not need anything from you!
If you get chilly, here's a blanket that I knitted you.
It took me all year.
[deep breath]
Sam?
You left your jacket in my room.
Oh, thanks.
So, uh, we finally, get a...
Moment alone here.
Yes. One moment.
One momentous moment.
I, uh... Know the timing of this is... Really crazy... [Sighs] and, uh... Jess...
God, I'm so nervous.
Um.
Jess, would you...
True American!
What?
Um, hey, guys, everybody out here!
We're playing true American!
Cece, I'm hollering! I'm hollering!
Schmidt: We can't play true American.
Winston: It's so late already.
No, we can't play... There's no time.
[whispering]: Help me.
We're gonna play true American because I want to.
I'm using my bride card!
The bride has spoken.
Tonight we celebrate the brides!
It's True America First ladies edition!
We can't play true American.
We have to, it's for Cece.
Fine.
We play fast, sober, then back to work.
Who the hell have I become?!
Let's do it.
Okay!
The kitchen is Michelle's garden, the bathroom is Mary Todd Lincoln's sanitarium, and as always...
The floor is lava! Let's go! One, two, three, four!
Jackie O!
All: Eleanor!
John cheated, so I'm redecorating the white house!
Everybody drink!
Even John John?
Yes!
Lava!
All right, all right.
I thought this was Nancy Reagan's g*n closet.
Lava!
Just someone explain to me the rules.
Camelot, Bay of Pigs.
You got to redecorate! Redecorate!
Redecorate! No, redecorate!
Hey, Jess, can I just talk to you real quick?
Lesbian road trip. Bye, FDR!
All: FDR! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink!
Rushmore!
Hillary headband hot potato!
All: Congress has her healthcare bill!
Nice and easy.
Oh! Oh!
Terrible toss!
All: Drink, drink! Drink, drink!
I know we're guests In this house, but it's awfully loud.
Mom!
We're trying to play a game, god!
Jenna goes to a Yale party!
No, no...

He's had enough, no more.
Skull and Bones!
No more, no more.
All: Skull and Bones!
All: Drink, drink!
Hey... Oh.
Seneca Falls Convention!
Women only!
That means you, Cece.
Sorry.
Sam was reaching for the ring and I freaked out.
How do you know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone?
You just know.
I don't know. I can't put it into words.
Try! There are a lot of words out there, just pick some of them.
Everything inside of me just said, "yes."
I just looked at him.
You know, I just had this feeling that I was home.
That is very beautiful...
And very, very vague and not helpful at all.
I do know you can't avoid Sam all night.
Coach: Guess who's back?
All: Coach!
[Laughing]: It's me.
Coach!
Yeah.
I thought you got in tomorrow.
I got on a plane, Dropped may off at the hotel And now I'm ready to party!
I had six wines on the plane!
I call Coach on my team!
Both: Coach on our team!
There's only one way to solve this.
Go behind the iron curtain.
You guys ready? One, two, three.
Sam: We got the same number!
That probably means something, right?
No, no, no, no, no.
All: Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
[Sighs and whistles]
[clears throat]
I feel like...
Like you've been avoiding me.
Winston: Good to have you back, Coach!
What are you doing?
Here I am.
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!
Coach: Where y'all going?
I'm gonna throw up!
Hi.
You gonna barf?
[heaves]
I muffed us!
[Sighs]
I muffed us straight to the moon!
I can never write my vows right now, I can barely even spell my own name.
"S", jeans...
Is that right?
Is "jeans" not a letter?
It feels like a letter to me.
Schmidt, this is...
I-I know it's something, is it not a letter?
This is all my fault.
I'm supposed to be your best man.
I screwed you, Schmidt.
I screwed you!
[Sighs] I was just trying to make Cece happy.
It's all I want.
It's all I ever want to do is just to make her happy.
Wait a second, say that again.
I screwed you.
Why would you go to that?
No, about making her happy.
All I want to do is make Cece happy?
[snaps fingers] There it is.
There's your big idea.
There's my big idea.
Yeah. To make her happy.
Both: That's it, that's it.
There's my big idea!
All I want to do is make Cece happy!
There it is!
"Jeans" isn't a letter!
[Laughs] Jeans is pants!
[Laughing]: Yeah.
Okay, Winnie, you said, "bride," to a girl you've been dating for a month?
I think it's sweet, shut up, Cece.
Shut up!
You shut up!
I miss you so much.
Oh, my god, I missed you.
Like, for real, missed you.
It's crazy being in New York 'cause I'm like, "Where's Cece?"
Right?!
Like I was saying, I don't know why I said it, it just came out, And I went from the happiest to the saddest person I've ever been in 15 seconds.
I just need to be cooler around her.
Coach, this is where you come into play.
I need your help, man.
I'm tired of being a sweetie pie.
No more talking.
Winston: This part of the game, Coach?
Heavy.
Why are we out here?
This is nice.
Oh!
Dude.
Hey, man.
How are you gonna ask me to help you play games with Aly, man?
You don't want that.
Be who you are.
Now, the only way to find out why she left, Is to go over there and ask her.
Now.
Yeah, but...
Just do it!
I don't yell in New York because everyone yells there And it's less meaningful, but I will yell here.
Now push the button.
God.
You really don't yell in New York?
Dude, I'm always in a museum.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm always in a museum.
So that's basically how you play true American.
Yeah, it makes no sense whatsoever.
Oh.
Look, I'm just gonna get this over with.
Um...
Jess, I want to break up...
I can't marry you.
With you.
Oh.
What?
So...
I really can't marry you.
No, I get it. You're in love with Diane.
She's beautiful, she's your best friend, you're both doctors.
This morning, I... I went to drop her off at the airport, and I just... I just couldn't let her go, and it made me realize that I...
I just... I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and, you know, uh, it's hard to express the feelings in words.
Really?! Really?
Why can no one put this into words?
I'm-i'm so sorry about the timing.
I just... I didn't want you to have to cut my photo out of all the, you know, wedding pictures.
And then with Winston's toast, with the... All the talk about honor and integrity and the gig economy, I just...
Can we just wait to tell people?
I... I don't want to make it about me before the wedding.
Of course.
Thanks.
Hey, I hope...
I hope Diane really likes the ring.
What ring?
The ring in your jacket pocket.
I don't have a ring in my jacket pocket.
I have a ring in my jacket pocket.
Yeah.
This isn't mine.
"To Susan. Love Louise."
Oh, my god, it's engraved?
How did I miss this?
And the font is huge.
So Schmidt's mom and her girlfriend are getting married.
They're what?
Ma?
Ma?!
Are you proposing to your friend Susan?
Ma?!
Oh, Winston, now's really not a good time.
I know saying the word "bride" to you was a little crazy, But let me just explain myself, okay?
What I meant to say is that you're beautiful.
Every day with you is so much better.
Your brain is banging.
The skin-bag it comes in ain't too bad either.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know what, except that I'm not sorry, okay?
Because this is who I am.
No, Winston, I have food poisoning.
Yeah, I don't know who let Nick's mute park friend cook dinner for 20, but I want to find and throw up on them.
That's why you left.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Because I don't like being vulnerable.
It was stupid of me. I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I love you, you maniac.
You love... You love me?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow, that feels so good to say.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I... Love... You.
[groans] How is there anything left?
[Groaning]
You okay?
[Retching]
Jess: So sorry for ruining your engagement.
I'm sure you didn't plan a joint celebration with a man wearing a beer can crown and pillows on his shoes.
Jealous 'cause I'm the true American.
We're sorry we left the ring in your room.
That's what we get for fooling around in your bed.
Susan: Something about those high ceilings.
We just like tossing each other around.
Jess: Hello! Hey, quick show of hands, god.
Who's had sex in Winston's room?
Well, I've had sex in your room.
I know.
What?!
Everyone's had sex in my room?
I got weird in there.
I've gotten weirder in there than you have.
Really?
Those pillows.
There's just, Like, extra, like...
Pressure.
Schmidt: If you don't mind, I'd like to say A few words about my mom and my mom's...
My mom's friend Susan.
My mom's friend Susan.
God, you guys, let me talk.
Look, Susan, I know I never fully accepted you.
I just... I didn't know how long you were gonna be around.
And, also, you used to call my mom the Big Ragoo and me the Little Ragoo, and I couldn't make any sense of it.
But... You're a part of our family now.
To my mom... And my mom.
Yeah!
Cheers! Cheers.
Cheers. Yeah, cheers.
Cheers.
Opa.
Yeah!
Aw.
Mwah.
Mmm.
Cece?
[Sighs]
Babe, what's wrong?
It's just that you're gonna have two moms at the wedding, and I'm not even gonna have one.
I really thought that... I really thought that She would just show up last-minute 'cause she would know how happy it would make me.
[Sniffles] I don't know why I'm crying in here.
Jess' room is meant for sex.
I know. Come here.
[Sniffles]
So, Just-just h*t lobby and let technology do its thing.
Yeah, cool. When-when I get in there, I'll just h*t lobby.
Cool.
Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on, Jess. You know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do. I mean, I know.
You do? Then what is it?
You know.
No, I-I don't know.
What-what is it?
It's Nick.

Peter.
That's Sam's favorite male nurse.
He's gotten him two years in a row for secret Santa, and last year, he got him $500, and this year, he got him crayons.
All over the map, that Peter.
So, when you get to Sam's birthday party, is the goal to impress his friends with how much you know about them or to terrify them?
I just want them to like me.
Finally, I feel like I'm in an adult relationship. He's a grown-up.
Hey, Jess, heads up, I borrowed your towel.
Use your own towel if you're gonna shower.
No, I didn't shower, I just sponged off.
Ew. Ugh! That's even worse.
You didn't even get clean before you used the towel.
It's called a French whore's bath.
You wouldn't make a dime as a French whore.
You would make zero dollars.
I'd make millions, millions.
Bonjour. Croissant. Millions.
Definitely not.
No.
That's disrespectful. Here.
[Jess and Cece scream]
Happy Bird Day, Dr. Sam.
Wow, you didn't have to do that.
Did you say, "Bird Day"?
You heard me. Well, you know, I figured Jess likes you, so I like you, too, man.
Welcome to the family.
H-Hey, look at that.
It's a shirt with a whole lot of birds on it.
That's a bird shirt. Bird shirt.
What? Why? What-what's the...?
Ah, you know why.
Cool shirt, dude.
[chuckles]
We're bird bros now.
And check it out, you can wear it to the party.
You know, nothing says, "This dude is dope," like a motherflippin' finch, am I right?
[laughs]
Schmidt: Sam, I'm so sorry I won't be able to attend your party.
I have wedding stuff.
"Stuff"?
Define "stuff."
Things.
Thank you.
I'm so excited to meet your friends, including Dr. Garfinkel...
[laughs]
Sam, I love the way you laugh.
You never open your mouth.
You're always like...
[mimics Sam's laugh]
I don't sound like that. [laughs]
No, you do. You just did it.
[phone chimes]
Hey, you got to add a flash card.
My friend Diane's coming.
She's in town for a podiatry conference.
She's a friend from med school.
Oh, I've never heard you mention her.
You guys close?
Diane!
Hi.
[both laugh]
They look... close.
Hi!
It's so good to see you.
So good to see you.
Way too close.
[both laughing]
♪
Hey, Schmidt, how many robots are too many robots?
Hi, Nick.
Gavin.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be at Sam's party.
What's he doing here?
Well, after the incident where my dad kissed... [heaving]
If you're gonna barf, just barf. It's not healthy to hold it in.
Where my dad kissed Jess, there was an accidental pocket dial that actually went pretty well.
He suggested some wine tasting for the wedding, and I said, "Why not?"
You're just gonna drink alone with your dad?
Join us, Nick, the Pinot from my vineyard is dynamite this year.
It's gonna taste fantastic at my son's wedding in a factory.
Gavin, it's actually a slaughterhouse, and you would know that if you were around more.
[pounds table] Can I see you in my room for a second, please?
Look, I know you don't trust my dad, but I'm happy that he's here.
We're working through stuff.
Wait, Schmidt, I want you to have a relationship with your father.
I really do, but I've been down this road so many times.
He just shows up out of the boo, and then all of a sudden expects...
It's "blue," it's "blue."
Well, thanks, Eye-stein.
He shows you a great time, you get sucked in, then he disappears and breaks your heart, and I'm left to pick up the pieces.
My dad's taking me to...
Miss Saigon tonight!
And I'm not gonna get hurt.
My dad never showed up.
He didn't?
It hurts so bad!
You want a milkshake, cowboy?
It's different now.
I've heard that before.
We're seeing Jersey Boys!
Wait, this is your dad we're talking about!
And he's different now, Nick.
[crying]: He's the same!
I didn't have ice cream, so I just really shook up some milk.
I'm older and I'm wiser, and I'm not gonna get sucked in.
We're gonna taste some wine, and then I'm gonna send him on his way.
But, Nick, I'm plead... I'm asking you... just be nice to him.
All right, man. I will.
If it means that much to you, of course, I'll do it.
Thank you.
But if it goes poorly, I'm not putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.
Am I Humpty Dumpty?
Yeah. I'm just not doing it again.
You won't have to.
Also, nowhere in that rhyme does it say he's an egg.
He's most definitely an egg, Nick.
So, what kind of king uses all those resources to put together one egg?
It's a parable.
Humpty Dumpty is the king.
Who told you that?
[laughing]
I've never seen him laugh like that.
[both laughing] What do I do?
Think of it this way: you're a dog, he's a f*re hydrant, you pee on him, girl.
Yeah.
There you go.
I'm gonna go lift a leg on him.
There you go!
Hey.
Oh, hey.
So, Sam said he spilled on the bird shirt and he had to take it off.
He's putting on a brave face, but, poor thing, I know he is just crushed.
Babe.
What, babe?
He doesn't like the shirt.
No, babe.
Yeah, babe.
No, babe.
Yeah, babe.
No... babe.
Yeah... babe.
No, babe.
Yeah, babe.
No... babe.
Yeah... babe.
No.
Yeah.
Babe.
Sam, do you remember in med school when we got drunk and sewed fins on that d*ad guy?
[both laugh]
We made a merman!
[laughs]
Hey, Sam, remember the other night when you ate all that bad crab and, uh, you said, "Not tonight," and I said, "Yeah, tonight," and then you said, "No, not tonight," and then the next night, when you were feeling better, remember what we did?
We... we had sex?
Had sex!
[Jess laughs]
The kind where you need a snack after.
Hey-o!
[clears throat]
Whoa.
So, Jess, you're from Portland. Do you, do you miss it?
[coughing] Do you miss Portland?
I mean, I feel like you never really...
[Jess coughing]
You... are you okay?
Oh, my God, are you choking?
Is that what this is? Oh, my God, stand up!
Stand up, stand up!
Get up, come here.
Oh!
[coughs]
Here, sit down.
[coughing]
Thank you, Diane.
You saved me.
Any time.
[sighs]
Um, hey, Diane, um, would you like to go to the ladies' room and freshen up?
Yes, Jess, I would love to.
I am so sorry.
I'm really... I'm-I'm embarrassed.
Please, for what?
No, I am.
For marking your territory? Look, I get it.
But I was acting childish and dumb and jealous, and-and I...
I see why Sam likes you.
Well, I see why he likes you, too.
Will you forgive me?
I have guy friends, and I don't know why I would just assume that you're wildly in love with him.
Oh, no, I am.
[laughs]
No, really, I am.
[laughs]
Seriously, I am.
[laughs]
Jess, I'm-I'm in love with Sam.
[whispers]: Oh, b*lls.
Now this varietal gained prominence in the '30s as an Italian driving wine.
Now they call it a picnic wine, but we know what they're up to.
But as they say, "Wine is fine, but bourbon is schwervin'."
I think I got a buzz.
Yeah, me too.
Hang on.
Uh, you're gonna like this.
How much hooch do you have stored in this place, you mountain person?
Prohibition happened once.
Nick and Gavin: It can happen again.
Yeah.
It was pretty easy to see where you were going with that.
Look at the two of you.
Bonding over the thing that numbs you.
[Nick and Gavin laugh]
Smell this. Smell this.
Oh!
Let me get a whiff. Let me get a whiff.
Oh!
Hurts so good.
Sam.
Guess who the luckiest boy in the world is?
It's you.
It's an extra bird shirt, huh?
I keep an extra one in my car, just in case I get interviewed on television.
Oh. Thank you.
Put on the bird shirt, Sam.
I will.
When?
When I don't have to take my other shirt off in a bar full of people.
Ten years?!
Yeah.
You didn't tell him for ten years?
I did.
Well, I tried to.
Um, our second year of med school, he went to work with Doctors Without Borders.
Well, so I didn't, I didn't know when I was gonna see him again, and, um, one night, I-I just sat down and wrote him a letter.
[gasps]
And everything came out, you know, everything that I was feeling, everything that I had been holding back.
Yeah. I love letters.
I know, me too.
We have so much in common.
Arguably too much.
Mm.
But keep going.
Well... Sam never responded.
[scoffs]
I just figured he didn't want to embarrass me, you know?
I mean, I-it's hard when you're friends with a guy first.
So... he came home, and we just kept on like normal, and it was really painful, but I-I couldn't lose him as a friend.
Of course you couldn't.
Then... last week, this came in the mail.
[gasps]
"Return to sender."
He never got it.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
He never knew how you felt.
No, and I-I came here tonight to give him this letter and then...
What happened?
I met you.
Oh, right.
Me.
Mm.
Here.
I can't throw it away, but I can't give it to him.
Don't worry, Jess, you... you didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not the one for Sam.
You are.
I'm gonna be really honest.
Um, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.
That was the most romantic story I've ever heard.
And I don't want to get between them.
Or do I?
I love Sam, and I don't want to throw it all away because she couldn't figure out how to buy a Forever stamp.
Just because you give Sam this letter, it does not mean that he's automatically gonna choose Diane.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
[scoffs] Damn it.
Look at them.
♪ Moon river ♪
♪ Wider than a mile ♪
♪ I'm crossing you in style... ♪
This song isn't even on our jukebox.
You know what, that's it.
I'm-I'm not losing Sam because I'm some dumb romantic.
Cece, get rid of this letter.
Lett'r done.
Good-bye, Diane.
Go back to fixing feet, you sweet saint of a woman.
You must be so proud of me.
I'm finally being practical and realistic, and not some moony-eyed freak who's seen too many romantic comedies.
I'm basically being you.
Not anymore, pal.
Schmidt's made me weak in my stupid knees.
I don't know.
This past year with Schmidt's changed me.
It's made me believe in love stories.
Is that why you were crying during the bank commercial where the two old people were texting each other?
Jessica...
I know.
They now have the money that they need...
No, I know... to be buried together.
[laughs]
We both know that you're not gonna be able to live with yourself if you don't give this letter to Sam.
Yeah.
What if I lose him?
Well, then you'll at least know, babe.
It's not your love story.
Oh.
I have something to tell you.
The old man in the bank commercial, um, played a n*zi in Schindler's List.
Does that change anything?
Schmidt: I made a model of our wedding venue.
Nick: Wow.
Your wine is so good, I really want to showcase it and-and put the bar here.
It's where they store the drums of wild chemicals, but I'm pretty sure they're empty now.
Yeah, it's empty except for the big puddle that never dries.
Gavin: Oh, it'll be fine.
With your mother there, that puddle will get drunk.
How about we grab some dinner?
[chuckles] Together?
You...
Yeah, no, I'd like that very much.
I'm gonna run home.
Obviously, I can't wear these shoes to dinner.
Ha, can you imagine?
I'll see you.
I'm going to dinner with my dad.
[door closes]
This is so great, man.
Yeah, it's great.
You guys are finally getting along.
You were like, "We've been down this road."
It's great. I just want to check in.
Y-You said you weren't gonna get sucked in, and it seems like you're getting sucked in.
Sucked in? I'm not getting sucked in.
If anybody's getting sucked, it's just me sucking myself in.
No, I know how that sounded.
Yeah.
But you, I mean you...
You good?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[door closes]
Hey, uh, Gavin, hold up.
Um... I feel like I can say this to you because, well, you know, we shared a cup.
You really live by a specific code.
Look, we both know how this is gonna go down, Gavin.
You're gonna get Schmidt's expectations up, and then you're gonna bail.
I know.
Just be better.
Be his dad.
Just be there for him, even when it's not fun, and sometimes it's really not fun.
I know.
I've been doing it for 15 years.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
Just promise me if you show up for dinner tonight, you'll show up tomorrow and the day after and the week after, and basically forever.
I will be there.
Will you, Gavin?
Will you?
Will you, Gavin?
I will.
Will you?
Will you, Gavin?
You're really dragging this out.
No, I've already gone through everything I had rehearsed.
I really thought the elevator would be here by now.
We could talk about other stuff.
Can we, Gavin?
Can we?
Yeah.
[elevator bell dings]
Can we, Gavin? Oh, thank God.
I'm getting my birthday present at an airport hotel?
Oh, my God, are you taking me on a trip to meet my birth mother?
Oh.
No, wait. [laughs]
Um, no.
Uh, it's, uh... I have a surprise for you, but it's not exactly a present.
Um, just wait here.
Okay.
Look, I want you to know that no matter what happens, no-no matter how this turns out... and by "this," you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about...
I want you to be happy.
And I want you to be happy.
But what did you want me to be before this moment?
Don't let me get a ticket, okay?
Jess?
Tell Sam.
He-he deserves to know how you feel.
Wow, you are either really cool or really cocky.
You are either really cool or really cocky.
Thank you.
[knocking]
I should've been more clear. He's downstairs.
I just want to let you know, my shift is up, so Jason will be getting bummed out by you for the rest of the night.
Somebody order a milkshake, cowboy?
Well, Nick, you were right.
I got sucked in.
He was a car wash vacuum, and I was just a stray pistachio.
Listen, Schmidt, it's my fault.
I got real with him and he split.
It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.
And, Nick?
Yeah?
Thank you.
Thanks for what?
For being there.
What are you doing right now?
[groans loudly]
Yeah, man.
I like red meat.
Yeah, yeah, no, beef.
Sexy ladies.
Boobs.
Moobs.
B-Boobs.
Big boobs.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.
Oh, don't, don't, don't!
Wait! Wait, guys, wait.
I know I should have been here an hour ago, but I was at the warehouse getting your security deposit back.
Why would you...
Let me finish, trust me.
That slumlord wouldn't give it to me unless I cleaned the place, and once I started...
I don't know if you know, but I'm a little OCD.
Me, too.
Yeah, it runs in the family.
Your grandfather had to touch every lamppost he passed.
He couldn't hold a job.
Until he got a job as a lamppost repair man.
Why wouldn't you just call?
Oh, I got kicked in the back of the head by some kids who were using that dump as a place to practice their urban dancing.
They-they were honestly pretty good, until they b*at me and took my phone.
And my wallet and my watch.
I had to run over here... well, actually it was... it was more of a... a walk-jog.
I threw up once.
I'm not very good at doing the right thing when it comes to you.
But I wanted to start tonight.
You are not getting married at that slaughterhouse.
Okay, well, then where am I getting married?
At my vineyard.
If you want.
It'll be beautiful.
I talked to Cece.
She said it's up to you.
I just want you to know, either way, I'm all in from here on out.
We're getting married at a vineyard.
Yes! Yes.
Getting married at a vineyard.
Gavin: Yes.
Yes, yes.
So, you just left him there to talk?
Yep, I abandoned my own car, and now, for all I know, Sam and Diane are tearing apart a business-friendly hotel room together.
Well, I'm really proud of you.
I know that it was hard, but it's the only way you're gonna find out what you need to know.
Thanks.
This might sound like a cry for help, but I promise you it's not.
Um, I'm gonna go to my room and I'm gonna watch videos of dogs waiting for their d*ad owners to come back.
Mm-hmm.
Cece, you want to know what I think?
Mm, not really.
I think there are people who get bird shirts, and there are people who don't.
Jessica Day needs to be with a bird shirt person.
Am I a bird shirt person?
Oh, Cece, why do you always have to make things about you?
[knocking at door]
Sam, hello.
[kisses]
I forgive you.
Okay. Okay.
Is Jess here?
She is.
[dog whining over laptop]
Hey.
Hey. [chuckles]
Hey.
I'm just, uh...
Yeah, I'm really nervous, so I'm just gonna ask you an innocuous question.
Um... did you bring my car back?
Yes, I have got your keys right here.
Thanks.
Look, what you did for me today was... the most selfless thing anyone has ever done for me.
Whatever... if there was ever a time for me and Diane, it's passed.
And when I read the letter, it just reminded me how much that's true.
[chuckles]
Now that I know you like letters, watch out.
I have to say, that was the strangest birthday surprise I have ever been given.
Well, Winston took my bird shirt idea, so...
[laughs]
You know what, one of these days, I'm gonna get you to laugh with your mouth open.
I know you will. That's what she said.
No, that's not gonna do it.
That's what she said.
You just said the same thing.
[Italian accent]: Now that's what she said.
That's... What accent is that?
It's Italian.
Oh, really?
That's what she said!
Nope, that didn't do it, either.
That's what she said.
Now you're just changing the stress.
That's what she said?
Maybe you should stop.
[laughs]
Jess: That's what she said. Ooh.
Sam: Ooh. That was closer.
J'accuse, Parikh!
Cette soupe est trop chaude.
You just said, "I accuse you," and, "the soup is too hot"?
Indeed, it is.
I told you you could see your wedding dress when I'm finished with it.
Hey.
Hey, hey, guys, she's writing something.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, that's something.
What's going on?
Yeah, but that was two months ago, and I need it by tomorrow night, Because I have to decide on my hair, on my jewelry...
Honey, honey, I am almost done with it.
So you got rid of the mirrors?
[laughing]: Definitely.
The battery pack?
Oh, yeah.
The little weird jacket that makes me look like I'm in a street g*ng from the future?
All that crap's gone.
I'll have it to you by tomorrow night.
It's a guarantee.
Okay. [chuckles]
I'm screwed.
I can't believe
I got to spend a whole day without noodling you like this.
If anyone finds out we're together, they're not gonna let us be partners.
So...
Before we figure out what this is...
Just be normal, okay?
No kissing, no touching, no doing that sex bark you do.
[whines]
I said not to do it.
[whines twice]
[laughs]
And also no doing that song you made up about squeezing me tight.
♪ Gonna squeeze you tight ♪
♪ So wrong it's right ♪

♪ Gonna fly the kite... ♪
Sorry, I know that's your thing.
I did not know she was here.
I did.
We have a situation.
I want to ask Reagan to the wedding, so I-I sent her a text to say, "Hey, how's your spring looking?"
That was an hour ago. No response.
Mm.
d*ad. Maybe she's d*ad.
Yeah.
Maybe-maybe she doesn't miss me, or maybe she forgot me.
How could she forget me after I gave her my body?
I thought you guys didn't have sex.
Uh, outercourse.
It counts.
Cece, I need you to send Reagan a text and if she responds, Then we'll know that she's at least alive... and ignoring me.
No, I'm not getting involved.
[whispering]: Cece...
Send the text.
That was terrifying.
Wow, that voice is giving me gooseflesh.
Mm, okay, fine, I'll do it.
[whispering]: Thank you very much.
You're welcome?
It's so easy; she's like a puppet.
I can hear you.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
Just say thank you.
Thank you.
Get some sleep, kid.
You know what, Jess...
Is this the dress?
This can't be the...
You told Cece it was almost done.
I know! I choked under the pressure.
I spent all last night trying to cr*ck it.
Nothing.
I can't make you beautiful unless you let me in!
[screaming]
I've never procrastinated like this.
Well, what a fun, low-stakes time to try new things.
I'm freaking out.
I've been working on this for months.
It's just...
It has to be perfect.
This dress is gonna be in every single picture, and people will say, "Cece, why do you look so bad?"
Also, "Who is that m*rder woman in the background?"
And the answer to both would be: Jess.
This is true. I see this happening exactly how you described it.
[screams]
Okay, could not sleep last night.
I'm too excited about the dress.
I'm ahead of schedule.
I'll have it to you this afternoon.
This afternoon?
Jess: Bye!
Oh, my God.
‭[laughs]
Ah! Why did I say that?
There was no reason for me to say that.
I can't work like this.
You have to get her out of here.
I can't take my idea walks.
Your idea walks? How did you become such an important part of my life?
When I craft, I like to get out of my space, bop around.
I use movement and scenery to tickle the old idea box, but I can't do that now, 'cause every ten minutes Cece comes in here, like, "Hey, Jessica, that dress is gonna be gangbusters, polka dots."
That's a really good Cece.
Also a passable Sinatra.
Jess, what if I told you that there was a place...
Where you could work in peace.
Um...
Schmidt, this is the men's room at your office.
Oh, no, this is my wedding workshop.
See, I'm the only guy in the building.
Well, except, of course, for Brian but, you know, I pay Brian eight dollars a day to do his poops at the big box store across the street.
That seems high.
When do you do the work that you get paid for?
Rarely, and it's a problem, but, you know, we couldn't afford a planner, so, here we are.
Please...
Have a seat at the think sink.
Oh.
Hmm.
Don't mind if I do.
[laughs]
I like its energy.
I will create a dress today.
If you need anything, just let me know. Also...
There's a fridge stocked with sparkling water in stall three.
Jess.
Dang, girl, you ugly.
Come on, mouse, how about we don't do this today.
Bishop.
Hmm?
Your fingers really that weak?
How do you button your pants in the morning?
[officers laugh]
Honestly, Sir, with, uh, great difficulty.
[officers laughing]
You guys should see Bishop load his g*n.
It's like watching a toddler eat peas.
[officers laugh]
Fellas, come on, this is the LAPD, right?
We can't bring this city together if we're tearing each other apart.
God, you're nice.
You're so nice, Daniels.
Thanks, buddy.
Everybody smells fantastic, by the way.
Thank you.
That's really nice, thanks, Daniels.
Very nice; he is very nice.
[knocking]
You wanted to see me, Kim?
Schmidt.
Why did you copy me on all these e-mails you sent planning your wedding?
What?
Oh. [clears throat]
Darn it.
Sorry about that.
Um, Kim is actually also the name of our chef's new assistant.
"Beaming over the peony centerpieces. No chance I'll get work done today."
"fat wet beats..."
FWB.
"What about a swing theme for cocktail hour? I'll spend the day brainstorming tracks. Out."
I'm no longer with fat wet beats.
We had a few conversations and he was being a straight-up ho.
Is this what you've been doing instead of the regional brand report?
It was due three days ago.
That.
Yes.
Of course, I'm gonna have that to you in...
Why are you Sm... why you smiling... at me like that?
I'm imagining what it would be like to f*re you.
The same feeling I had when we unplugged my mother-in-law.
Beep... Beep... Beep...
Is that legal... In California?
You've been warned.
If I catch you doing anything at all related to your wedding, you are out.
Jess, Jess, you gotta get out of here.
Je-jess.
Oh, dear Lord.
So, Aly said that she wanted to keep things normal at work...
Okay.
But then she ripped me in front of everyone, dude.
Isn't ripping you what Aly does?
Yes, but we're a couple now, man.
I'm flummoxed. What should I do?
Should I say something?
No.
Don't communicate.
It's not gonna get you anywhere.
What you gotta do is you gotta follow her lead.
Gotta play the game, like I'm doing with Reagan. I'm play... hey, Cece?
Mm?
Uh, did Regan text you back yet?
In the past three minutes, no.
Son of a bi... o-okay, you know what? Plan B.
I'm texting her from my burner.
Hmm?
Why do you have a burner phone?
That's an insane question, dude.
[laughs]
That's not an answer.
A burner is crazy. Look, if Reagan had her phone, she would have texted me back.
She's probably on a plane or in a spa or...
[phone blips]
Well, she just responded.
What?!
I said, "What are you doing for dinner?"
And she just texted back, "Who dis?"
So I'm gonna text, "Who you think dis is?"
[laughs]
So now we play the waiting game.
[phone blips]
"Karen?"
She thinks I'm Karen.
Oh, yeah, I can be Karen...
And Karen's gonna get some answers.
You know, as a cop, I find this to be very disturbing.
But as a friend...
[wry chuckle]
Man, this is straight-up delicious.
Mmm!
[Winston slurping]
Oh!
[Winston laughing]
Sit much, dummy?
[laughing]: Look at her.
[laughing]
‭Thank you.
She's so stupid.
What?
What the hell was that?
Just being normal. [laughs]
That was not normal.
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know how to act around you.
I can't kiss you.
I can't prank you.
I can't keep this bottled up.
Winnie needs an outlet.
I know, I know we're incredibly sexual people.
That's right.
But if we try...
We can keep our hands off of each other.
[wry, quiet laugh]
There is that hand I was looking for.
Good job, officer.
Yeah.
Hey, Daniels.
Hey.
Hey, guys.
TGI Thursday, am I right?
Okay.
As you were.
[sighs]
That was close.
He saw us.
Ooh, uh, P-Penelope.
Have you seen a girl wandering around?
Um, look-looks like a drawing of a best friend that an eight-year-old would make.
Jess.
Oh, Schmidt.
What?
Do you think this neckline is too risque?
No secret, your girls got b*mb.
She does, and normally, there's nothing I'd rather talk about, but Kim is on a rampage and I forgot about this fakakta report that's due.
If she finds you here helping with the wedding...
Schmidt!
Ha, ho...
You walk on cat feet, you do.
Who is this?
Who's who?
This woman between us.
There's no one else I could be talking about.
There's so many women in this office.
Who is this woman between us sitting on the couch, Schmidt?
I'm so lost.
Her.
Now I see her.
Hi.
Hi.
Jess is...
She's the new temp.
I'm Jess, the new temp.
Good, I need someone.
Come with me. Up, let's go.
Looks like you make your own jewelry.
I'm gonna tell you right now, I don't want to hear about it.
[whispering]: She's mean.
Temp! Come!
Jess, this is a disaster.
We need to get you out of here before Kim actually puts my b*lls in the jar on her desk "for Schmidt's b*lls."
We need an excuse so airtight that she'll have to let you leave.
I got it.
My mother is in grave danger.
No, she's not.
Pick up my kids.
All right, hurry up, you almost people!
[children shouting]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Little girl, come back!
Come back!
Sorry, I'm gonna need a minute.
I'm gonna need a minute!
[car horns honking]
I don't even know these kids!
Hey, Jess, so, you know, just-just give me something to hold onto.
Just tell me about the dress.
[children screaming]
Are you with kids right now?
[children shouting]
No, no.
[grunting]
Did you just rip that book in half?
What are you, the Hulk?
Um, yeah, you want to know something about the dress.
Right, okay, um...
It's white.
I love it, I love it.
Oh, my God, I cannot wait for tonight.
Tonight, yup.
Okay.
[chuckles] Bye.
Aah! Stop!
Um... Have you guys ever seen where your mommy works?
What do we do?
There's no way he didn't see us making out.
Okay, first of all, you need to stop freaking out, okay?
You are panicking right now, and you're causing a scene.
But listen, Daniels is the nicest guy in the world.
I'm sure if we explain to him our situation, he'll be cool.
All right. Let's go.
Okay.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, guys.
[groans] I'm so sorry that I walked in on you before, but, uh, you know, if I can be honest...
I'm super excited.
I think you guys make a great couple.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Wow.
I mean, that, uh, that means a lot.
Okay, cool.
So I take it this, you know, stays between us?
Oh, absolutely. Come on.
Are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah, just give me $5,000 and, uh, we're good.
What?
But you were so nice.
Oh, I am, very nice, yeah.
But I'm also a guy with a huge gambling problem, you know?
Mostly on the ponies, but last night, I lost 60 large on a big game of "I Spy."
[chuckles]
Just didn't see that tree.
What are you gonna do?
[laughs]
Yeah.
You know this is blackmail... and you're a police officer.
Oh... I am a disaster.
Should I...
Do we have a deal or do I go to the sergeant?
How do we want to...?
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wow.
You don't own us.
You know what...
Everybody, Bishop and I are...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you sure about this?
Yes.
Yeah, I've never been more sure of anything.
Hey, everyone, Bishop and I are dating.
All right?
That's right.
We are rubbing butts and we don't care who knows it.
So...
You two are hooking up.
Yes, but...
Yeah...
First of all, it's, like, so new...
I get it. I get it.
Winston is hot as hell.
Some days, I'd like to drawer this badge and hold him like a baby.
[chokes]
What?
[deep growl]
Anyway, you can't be partners while you're dating.
I'll, uh, split you and assign one of you to our floater.
What? Daniels?!
That guy tried to blackmail us.
That jelly bean? [laughs]
Nice try.
[Sergeant laughing]
Bishop, uh, can I take a picture of you eating a Popsicle?
What?
No.
Just do it.
Hey, hey, come back here!
[girl squealing]
Be careful, that has pins in it.
Jess, what the hell are you doing in here?
Well, I couldn't stop working but... help me get this dress. Uh, hey stop that.
Little girl. Come here.
Come here. Little girl.
You get over here. Jess, yank it off her.
Stay still, come on.
Yank it off her!
Wait, stop moving.
[girl laughing]
Take this dress off, young lady.
Hi, Mom.
I'm fired, aren't I?
[boy whoops, glass breaks]
Oh, my God, I can't believe we got fired.
You never had a job here.
I'm so sorry, Schmidt.
It's not your fault.
Entirely.
I knew if I took my eye off the ball, these estrogen zombies would suck out my soul, but boy, did I love working here.
I loved every one of these malnourished, high-strung sociopaths.
Do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you?
How am I supposed to marry the most perfect woman in the world if I can't give her the most perfect wedding?
How am I supposed to give Cece a dress that's not as perfect as she is?
You can't f*re Schmidt.
You... give him his job back.
That's not going to happen.
Are you sure you want to say that to the person who saw your schedule?
Who would a married woman be meeting at a hotel tonight?
My father.
Oh!
[laughs]
Well, that sounds nice.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Jess. I'm Schmidt's friend and I'm not a temp.
I teach at Banyon Canyon.
Banyon Canyon?
I tried to get my kids in there but there's been some resistance.
They're biters.
Hard to get in Banyon Canyon.
Don't know what it's worth to have a friend on the inside.
Cece! Will you help me?
I hear you walking.
Oh, um, what am I looking at here, man?
This is rock bottom.
I spent $200 on burner phones and Reagan still hasn't responded to my original text.
Why don't you just text her as yourself?
You don't think it's too late?
Only one way to find out.
All right.
What do I have to lose at this point?
I don't have any more money.
Hey, Reagan, it's Nick.
Miller.
Uh, we lived in the loft together just...
We connected and we...
Get to the point.
Not gonna send any of that.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Reagan.
I'm gonna keep that.
Reagan, it's Nick.
Would you go to Cece and Schmidt's wedding with me?
I would love to see you.
Send.
Great!
Now you'll know, one way or the other.
[phone blips]
She just wrote back. She already wrote back.
I-I can't swipe because my thumb is a little sweaty. Will you swipe for me?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, okay, okay.
Just read it. Just read it. Okay, okay, okay.
"Um, hey, Nick, you idiot.
I know it's you texting me from these numbers."
I can't disagree. She gets me.
Um, "I'd love to come to the wedding..."
Yes! Okay, good.
Great!
"But I can't because I have to work. I miss you."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, that... But, yeah.
It mean, it means that she's thinking about you, so that's... that's good.
Most "derfinitely."
I'm sorry.
No, why sorry?
This is a success.
"Derfinitely, derfinitely, derfinitely."
I'm sorry, Nick; I am.
Turn "fiddy cent" into a dollar.
Are you about to cry now?
Me? No.
You-you look like you're getting a little emotional; are you good?
I'm not at all, actually.
Do you want some tissues...
Or...
No, can I have my phone, please?
Yeah.
Do you mind leaving?
Not at all.
Thanks for the good advice.
[sighs, groans]
[Nick grunts, groans]
Here you go, sir, a little lemon, a little honey.
Be careful, it's hot now, okay?
So...
Which one of us takes the blackmailing gambling addict?
I'll take him.
Can't be worse than the job I had before this...
Photographing those idiot babies.
Uncross your eyes, you idiot baby.
[crying]
Is that why you have all those pictures of crying babies dressed as vegetables in your living room?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that was weird.
I tell you what, uh, I'll partner with Daniels.
You would do that for me?
I'll take Daniels, yeah.
Thank you.
Of course, of course, but... it does come at a price.
Ugh... I knew you were gonna...

Here they come.
Banana cramps.
Okay, bananas are supposed to stop cramps.
Mm-mm.
Babe, how many of those have you eaten?
This many.
Oh...!
[sighs] Cece...
What are we gonna do?
It's gonna be okay, all right?
You don't need to work in that cat box, anyway.
You deserve so much better.
Thank you.
Schmidt, I got your job back.
Oh, thank Jesus.
Let's just say some kids from Banyon Canyon are gonna get bit.
Now, it's not exactly your old job...
It doesn't matter. I'll take it.
Jess... [inhales] thank you.
And, Cece, about your dress...
I should have told you before but, um...
But Jess... says that it's, uh...
That it's gorgeous.
Oh... [laughs]
Oh!
Great.
Yeah, and it just needs one final touch.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, you had me worried.
Whew! [laughs]
Why did you tell her that?
Well, because, look, I know how much this dress means to her and I...
I do think that, together, we...
Dear lord, I can't even look at this thing anymore.
I keep forgetting how awful it is.
Please, take it off of the form.
At some point, we'll figure something out.
I'd say let's burn it, but it looks completely inflammable.
Oh, my God.
[Jess gasps]
Inside out... It's...
Cece!
What's happening?
What are you talking about?
Get out! It's bad luck to see it.
It's bad luck to see it, move!
Bad luck to see...
What are you talking about?
Get out!
See what?
What?
What, is it ready?
Get-get out!
Hold up!
No!
[gasps]
It's amazing.
Yeah, if we just, you know, take up the...
We just have to bunch it up a little bit, right here.
Yeah.
[gasps]
It's perfect.
Jess...
Congratulations.
It's a dress.
We have a dress? We have a Dre... We have a dress!
Everybody, we have a dress!
Man, what are you yelling about?
We have a dress.
Cece's dress! Come see!
Let's just go do it and then it'll be over, right?
Okay, let's do it, all right.
Wow!
Not you.
Not me. Not...
Not me. Okay.
Ooh! This is...
Whatever you do, don't let Nick touch it.
I'm sure he's got lasagna all under his fingernails.
Cece [muffled]: How did you do this?
[Jess speaking low and indistinct]
Can someone at least describe it to me?
In a word, breathability.
Real funny, man.
[others conversing, muffled and indistinct]
Who knew you were a seamstress?
I guess-i guess I'll wait.

We're just gonna have a chill day in.
Winston: Road trip!
Nick: Yeah!
I said, "Chill day in..." but did I mean it?
[laughs]
Wait, I thought we were having a chill day.
Oh... we are...
Oh, good... not.
Welcome to your bachelorette party 2.0.
I got... the nail polish.
Mm.
I got comfy socks.
Okay.
I have Canadian Broadcast Television's 1985 masterpiece, Anne of Green Gables.
Good ol' A.G.G.
But, oh, wait... who invited this little green chimney?
I-it's a bong.
Yeah.
Oh, scoot, once every ten years, Jessica Day likes to partake in what the Native Americans call cannabis.
That's Latin.
I like to call it Giggle Dirt.
You know, we really don't have to do this, because every time you smoke weed you almost die.

Man, I...
I-I love Schmidt, you know I love Schmidt, but I would throw it all away for Gilbert.
I would just ruin my life to that boy.
I'm just sorry you had to share it with me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The very fact that socks exist is proof that shoes don't work.
Oh, my God, I... my hearing is, like, so good without my glasses on.

Oh, my God, wait till you try that.

Put them on.
It's like my hearing is, like, what a dog hears.

Man.
Oh, my God.
Okay, this stuff is really strong.
Where did you get it?
I know people... through you.
So, it's just gonna be me and Cece, uh, but I want to, you know, throw a little... gasoline on the f*re, if you know what I mean.
I have Russian nesting doll.
Uh-oh.
It's grenade.
Just looking for a little weed, Nadia.
And what the heck, throw in that bag of kettle corn, too.

Oh, scoot!
You got me a stripper?!
So, uh, you want me to sign my package, or...
Wait, I think he's just a...
A man... trying to do my job for the U.S. Postal Service, not a stripper.
Yes, I dance.
Yes, I'm sexy... but I don't do it professionally.
Now, could you please just sign here?
Your calves look like a snake swallowed a bag of ropes. You know that, right?
I'm sorry for my friend objectifying you, but in her defense, you are fine as hell.
Fine as hell!
I know you're not a stripper, but is there any way you could just take your short pants off?
Mm-hmm.
[chuckles]
Have a nice day.
Om, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
Nom, nom, nom.
Sorry.
Very sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
But we are not sorry about that.
Keep walking away there!
Oh, keep... slow... it down there for a second.
[whooping]
Ay-ay-ay.
Ooh...
[yelling grito]
[both catcalling]
Smack that! Sorry.
Ooh.
[grunts]
I think this is a gift from our registry.
Wait, don't open it!
What if I-inside of it is us, but we're older?
I've no clue what this is.
You know, Schmidt handled everything from the registry.
[scanner beeping]
Crockpot!
Kettle, kettle!
Espresso maker!
Trivet!
Melon baller!
It's a bread maker?
From... oh, from Schmidt's mom.
"Cece, this bread maker couldn't be easier to use."
"It has one button."
"Even you can do it with a few tries."
"Ha, ha, Louise."
What does that mean?!
Oh, no.
She...
Oh, no!
I mean, is she trying to say that I can't even push one button?
She doesn't think that I can take care of her precious, little boy.
She doesn't like that Schmidt does all the cooking...
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
This simple bitch wants you to be some kind of June Cleaver, Betty Draper, Carol Brady wifey?!
Mm-mm.
It is the 21st century!
Uh-huh.
Fifth generation feminism!
Keep going.
Work-life balance!
We need to rise up.
Yeah!
22% less pay for the same job?!
Don't tell me what to wax!
Sideburn where my thigh turn.
You know what we need to do to this thing?!
Bake bread in it!
Wait, wait, wait!
What, what?!
You'll do a lot more damage with this.
This is why I love you.
Homemade bread's for Europeans!
That's right!
Yeah!
U.S.A.!
Both: U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Oh, my God, I just realized some day I'm gonna have to speak at my mother's funeral.
Wow.
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!
[phone ringing]
U.S.A.! - U.S.A.!
Oh, wait... hey!
We're coming up on the rental place right now.
I just got an e-mail notification that our first wedding gift has arrived.
Oh, y-you did?
Spoiler alert, it's a bread maker.
Bread maker.
Cece, do me a favor and bring it inside.
It's in the hallway right now.
Yeah, I'll-I'll go...
I'll go get the... the bread maker and bring it inside, in one piece, safe and sound.
I love you so much, I got to go.
Schmidt, Nick, Winston: Bread maker!
[phone beeps off]
This was shipped like this so we are gonna need a new one.
You obviously broke this yourself.
Uh...
[laughs]
You obviously broke it yourself.
Yup.
No.
[Jess laughs]
You crushed it with your mind.
Okay, you're calling me a witch?
No, no, no, a sorceress, A sorceress.
You just have magical powers, you don't like...
I don't know how I can help you today.
It's like that episode of... remember that episode?
Yeah.
Of that... yeah.
[sighs]
So...
Okay, so, like, um... how-how much would it... would it be to replace it?
It's $1,200.
Is there a store in the mall that sells $1,200 for, like, $50?
How is this thing so expensive?
Jess: Aly!
What are you doing here?
Seriously?
We just had this conversation outside the mall.
Hey.
Jess: Aly!
What are you doing here?
You don't... remember that?
No, no, I do, I do.
You don't, do you?
I don't.
[Jess laughs]
I don't.
I do.
Really?
No.
Okay.
It's Cece's bachelorette party.
Yeah...
It's Cece's bachelorette party.
Oh, yeah.
You do remember it?
No. [laughs]
Don't remember it?
Mm-mm.
Anyway... this is my super present boyfriend, Tripp.
I'm sorry, he's dealing with a very important work crisis right now, since he's an agent for animal actors.
Fine, fine!
Hire Colonel Fantastic instead of Maurice.
You want to walk onto Alfonso Cuarón's set and tell him that he lost his lead otter, be my-be my guest, okay.
Who's gonna get her in the water with Naomi Watts?
Colonel Fantastic?
Yeah, right.
It's my fifth year anniversary of being a cop and he's supposed to make me dinner... if he ever gets off the phone.
Hey, babe, I need a left-handed spatula, okay?
Don't tell me it's not a thing; it's a thing.
Soul mates do exist.
[laughs]
What a wang.
[both chuckle]
You know what?
Hmm?
[gasps]
I'm gonna tell Aly that Winston's in love with her!
No, Winston would k*ll you.
Okay, I'll just text Winston and I'll get him up to speed on Aly and Tripp.
[humming]: Nailed it.
Excuse me, are you actually gonna buy something?
Yeah, we need to buy another bread maker, 'cause you claim we "destroyed" this one "with a stick."
I never said stick and we're out of stock.
Well, maybe that's what you said.
You destroyed this thing with the stock.
Is that what you did?
You b*at this with a stick?
No, I didn't, I said you said... you said stick.
But I didn't say stick.
I never said stick.
I don't even have a stick.
I live downtown.
Well, we're-we're out of stock, so...
But you-you have one right there.
[gasps]
Oh... that's the floor model.
Can't sell the floor model.
Yes, you... it's right there.
It's right there.
We need it to sell other bread makers.
You just said you don't have other bread makers.
I don't make the rules.
Who makes the rules?
Derek.
[inhaling]
Definitely too high No, I cannot deal to talk to Derek. with Derek right now.
Okay, I have a really good plan, all right?
We just leave this here and then we go do something different.
Jessica, that is the first thing that Schmidt and I own together and I ruined it.
I have to do something.
I have to replace it.

For the love of mack daddy, why can't you be cool?
Shut it!
You're in my house now.
Calm down, sir, your house is clearly a lost and found.
Jess: And it's all just baby shoes... and babies don't even need shoes.
Why not put that money towards something worthwhile like a cute hat or a raincoat?
[laughing]: A baby in a raincoat.
It's like... just like a... a little baby meteorologist.
[laughs]
Hey, so, it's this simple, okay.
We wanted to pay for the bread maker, but they wouldn't let us pay for it because it was a floor model, so we had a plan... I don't care.
[laughs] [lock clicks]
[laughs]
Baby in a raincoat.
[Jess laughing]
This is bad, you guys. This is really bad!
He's gonna call the real cops and I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
I could lose my job... or worse...
[gasps]
They put me on train duty.
I'm so sorry we got you in this situation, okay.
I am so sorry, too.
Okay, how do we get out of here?
How, how? Before the cops come.
Oh!
Yes, okay, guys, here's how we get out of here.
We dress up in the clothes from the lost and found, and we start crying, and then he comes back in and he's like, "Where are the girls?"
This is just babies in here."
You're incredibly high.
No.
Yeah.
No.
Mm-hmm.
No. No.
Yeah.
Who?
You. You, babe.
How did you know?
Oh, I knew from the first second I saw you.
Like, literally the first second.
Okay, ideas, you, go.
Oh, no, no, no, I am not giving you any ideas because it was my idea that got us into this mess in the first place.
First...
I bashed Schmidt's $1,200 bread maker.
$1,200?
Yeah.
For a bread maker?
I know.
That's a lot of dough.
I'm trying to wink.
Am I winking?
Then I got my best friend here to commit a crime, and now you might have... train duty?
It's like marathon duty but without the hot guys pooping their pants.
What does that say about me if I can't even take care of a bread maker?
What if Louise was right?
What if I can't take care of Schmidt?
How can you say you don't take care of people?
You've been taking care of me my entire life.
You're fierce and you are strong, and you would stand up for anyone that you love.
You're like a big, scary mama bear.
I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!
[grunting]
Jess: Ah...
[Jess laughing]
I'm okay.
[sighs]
You're my mama bear, girl.
Oh...
I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.
[gasps]
[whispering]: Oh, don't.
[whispering]: You do.
I just... I've been a cop for five years and...
You do.
Jessica!
I just wanted to celebrate it, [mouthing] but then Tripp had to leave to meet an owl for sushi.
An owl he sent a basket of mice to at Christmas, who I'm pretty sure has a nicer house than me.
[gasps] Let me tell her... please!
[door opens]
I'll blame it on being stoned.
Stoned?
You're stoned?
That makes this a drug case.
Okay, yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.
Wait, no, I made a mistake.
You better get comfortable, you're gonna be here for a long time, lady!

I'm gonna go for the little boy.

Don't touch Dirt Boy.
Dirt Boy touches you.
Why did you not more forcefully talk me out of this?
Why is that little boy not in a day care?
Are we fighting or not?
What are we gonna do?
We gotta do something, Schmidt.
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!
What are you doing?
I'm being a man.
I'm Schmidt!

Why does he keep saying his name?
I'm Schmidt.
In case you're wondering what my n... what my name is, it's Schmidt.
Schmidt!
This is Nick! Nick! Schmidt!
You know what would be a good plan?
You get a job at a Raisin Bran factory, right?
You start stealing all of the raisins, okay? You follow?
Then you hydrate those raisins to make them turn back into grapes, and you sell the grapes.
There's no overhead, and you make you a very rich man.
That's right, Wilson.
You have surrendered to the night.
I'm Wilson.
Schmidt! Yeah, I'm Schmidt!
My babies.
Ain't nobody gonna touch my babies.

When things started escalating, I just rolled up into a little ball like an armadillo.
Fellas, can I get real for a second?
I was thinking about Aly the entire time.
This is one of her barrettes.
You know, women use barrettes to keep their hairs in different styles. Yeah.
But Aly uses this to pin her hair up when she's on duty.
And I kept it.
[chuckles] That's how pathetic I am.
That's not pathetic.
It's lovely.
It reminds me of all my old lost loves.
Yeah. Cece.
Or my ex.
She was a pill, but when she used to go to second base on me, she was like Joe Morgan.

Yes.

Look, it's 2016.
She's not looking for a strong husband.
That... no, tha-that's not what I was gonna...
That's not where I was going with this.
I'm getting married, Nick.
How am I going to defend Cece?
She deserves the best husband in the world, and what if I don't have what it takes?
Of course you have what it takes to be a modern husband.
Do you have what it takes to be a husband of the old world?
God, no.
They would use you as a pelt.
Today, you fought, kinda.
You're gonna make a great husband to Cece.
How do you know?
Because I know.
Because why?
Because.
Look what happened here today. Because why?
Beca... ever since I've known you, you've been there.
Okay, you're always there.
Even when I don't want you there, you're there.
That's what a husband does.
You fight for me. That's what a husband does.
You care about what I eat.
That's what a husband does.
You've cooked for me, even when I don't ask.
That's what a husband does.
When I pass out, you comb my hair so there's no knots in it.
That's what a husband does.
So, guess what.
You're gonna be a great husband to Cece because you're a great husband to me.
So that's how I know.
You're, you're like my husband.
You're like my wife, but...
Yeah, so that's how I know.
Thanks for saying that, man.
Yeah, man.

I need this to be done, okay?
Well, you can't take it back. I heard you say it, Nick.

We're pouring out one for our lost loves.
Good-bye, unrequited love for Aly.
May I now heal and, and move forward.
I'm proud of you, man.

You don't have to do that. I mean, it's not...
I don't really need it, but...
Whoa.
Aly is single.
Aly is single!
Nice! Oh, great.
Hey. Hey.
Okay, so are you gonna tell her how you feel?
I don't know. I don't know, uh, I don't know, I mean, what if she doesn't like me back?
What if I'm not good enough for her?
What if I can't bear her sons?
You have to try. Look, I didn't think I was good enough for Cece.
You aren't.
Winston, I don't know how this is going to work out, but you need to know that you're good enough.
You got a heart of gold.
You got a smile that... [groaning]
He's been having some really nice moments today and then kind of freaking out.
You son of a bitch!
So, what, you guys think I should tell her how I feel?
Yes. You absolutely should.
Let's go now.
What about your bachelor party?
Who could want anything more from a bachelor party than their best friend telling him that they love him.
No. For real? You said that?
I didn't tell him that I love him. Let's be clear about that.
I missed that?
You know what?
I'm gonna tell Cece how I feel about her.
I'm gonna get her back.
You do that, bud... wait, wait.
Both: What?
You guys go on ahead without me.
I'm gonna hang back here for another round with my desert queen.
Besides, there's nothing for me in the city.

I'm actually really happy that you're eating breakfast, Nick.
It's nice to know that you're taking care of yourself.
Thank you.
Well, I'm on my way to meet Aly and her boyfriend for brunch.

Yeah, that was sarcasm.
And this is shark-casm: I just hate eating people.
Dear Lord, do you mean to tell me that you're going to brunch with the woman that you love and her boyfriend?
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
No, it's not that bad. I mean, I'm in a prank marriage, anyway.

He was wearing this.
He was wearing a frickin' football helmet.
Ah, damn.
What happened next was primal.
Man versus woman.
The ancient battle of the flesh.
Calm down. It's probably just happening because you're getting more serious with Sam.
Yes.
And Sam is finally, just a little bit, sort of, starting to trust me.
And he wants me to meet his parents.
You can't meet a man's parents if your ex is making love to you in your head.
I need my mind Nick-free by tonight.
On this bed is everything Nick gave me while we were together.
I'm going to get rid of it to clear my subconscious.

Good-bye, uh, lacquered bagel with my name on it.
Good-bye, world's tiniest hedgehog.
That was a gift?
Good-bye almost done Rubik's Cube.
Literally, it was one turn from the end and he would not finish it.
That makes sense with Nick.
People try to pretend like the brain is so complicated, but I feel better already.
Well, the two most important men in my life are finally meeting.
And for some reason this other guy's here.
Yo.
Hey, brunch is on me today, guys, okay?
So, feel free to add blue cheese to anything.
I'm an agent for animal actors.
He's doing pretty good.
He recently signed the crow from Game of Thrones.
Darnell. You know his name.
Darnell. That's right.
I didn't realize an animal agent was a real job.
Let me put it to you this way, so the next Avatar movie takes place on a cat planet, and, uh, I was the first one they called.
Shut up.
I know.
I knew you were gonna like that.
A cat planet?
I know. He swore me to secrecy.
I was gonna tell you.
My good... you know, I always thought Furguson should be in the movies.
Would you interested in, uh, I don't know, taking a meeting with him?
He's got no representation, so he's...
Let me guess. Wait. He has an adorable yawn?
Yeah.
Of course he does.
He's a cat.
But can he show up every day to work?
I run a business. Pass.
Yeah, never mind. Dumb idea.
Tripp, you have got to sit down with Furguson.
He's literally one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever laid eyes on.
Really? I thought you hated him.
I thought you hated cats in general, actually.
I love Furguson, are you kidding me? It's Furguson.
He's got that, uh... he's got the little, uh, his, uh...
You know, his front?
Does he have a headshot?
No, but W-Winston, actually does have a lot of 8x10 photos of the cat's face.
All right, fine. Bring him by my office.
Can't miss it. It's the tallest building in Beverly Hills.
Hey, hey, hey. Where'd you get that?
I got this from the shoulder-less Dutch boy you live with.

I don't want your rock babies.
Well, I'll just keep 'em.
Okay.

No dirty dreams. No one had dirty dreams.
What are you talking about? No dirty dreams.
So there has been dirty dreams?
No.
What'd you have a dream about?
It's interesting, Jessica. What was it about?
There was no dream, dude.
Well, which one of you is gonna cr*ck and tell me what the dream was about? Jess?
Or Cece?
You looked at the helmet.
Cece!
I did not. I did not.
You had a sex dream about a Bear's helmet?
Who was wearing it? Ditka?
Vic Fangio? John Fox?
Our GM, Ryan Pace?

So...
She doesn't know those people.
So it was somebody you know.
There wasn't... No. Absolutely not. No.

Oh, just every single detail about the dream.
Damn.
Now, and this one is a biggie, was I 100% percent human?
What?
Obviously.
Okay, I'm just trying to figure out the reality of the dream.
Well, we were having sex, so in that sense, it was not reality-based at all, because that's never gonna happen again.
Oh!
You sound like the beginning of a Salt-N-Pepa song, and I just wish we could just, like, act like adults.
Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely.
Were you just recreating our best encounter?
Was it Glove City again?
Our best was not Glove City.
Oh, it wasn't?
It was for you, but not for me.
So what was our best, in your opinion?
Ooh, you just walked right into that one.
Okay, it wasn't something that actually happened.
It was historical.
Oh, historical, so was there a dragon?
No, it was historical.
You think dragons are real?
I think there's a lot of debate about it.
And there's a lot of blogs about it.
And I know that as a fact, 'cause I've written one.
Do you think dinosaurs are dragons?

I was four steps away from freedom [sighs] and I fell.
Oh, they were on me, and they traversed me.
It was like I was their city and they were all rushing to work.
May I just please take a moment with Patches?
She needs a, a moment to center herself.
She almost OD'd on catnip.
Forget about Patches.
You should represent more cats like Furguson.
What?
What? You were laughing at him.
He's an original.
Makes Patches look like a Culkin brother.
What?!
[laughing]
It's hard to celebrate this moment with so much cat hair in my mouth.
You did it, buddy.
Really? Really? Now you're gloating?
Huh? Winston?
Ah.
Do you have to be such a dick?
I mean, you're already so intimidating.
Do you have to go out of your way to actually get at me?
Intimidating?
Aly talks about you all the time, obviously.
You're a cop. You're a hero.
Last weekend, I went to a turtle's birthday party.
This is oddly emotional.
You're intimidated by me?
Yes.
It's funny how life works, man. It's ironic.
This is amazing.
You know what, Tripp?
You don't have to worry about Furguson competing with Patches.
Yeah.
I'm taking him out of the game.
I don't like this life for him.
Oh, yeah!
You blew it, son.
Oh, God, am I unhappy.
I'm casting cats.
[Patches meows]
Hi. So sorry I'm late.
It's a long story. [laughs nervously]
I'm really glad you made it.
Me, too.
Uh, Dad, Dad, this is Jess.
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Oh. Huh. A little piece of helmet.
[laughs]
♪ ♪
What did you think of Tripp?
I know he's a little intense.
Well, look, I mean, if he makes you happy, then, uh... and I like him, so...
Thanks.
You know, for a guy who eats his raisins hot, your opinion means a lot to me.
Thank you.
What's up with Schmidt?
[hissing, huffs]
Oh, he's haunted.
Hey.
Hey.
Did you have a dream last night?
Yeah, just the usual.
You know, the one where I'm in a muffin test kitchen and Hillary Clinton tells me my muffins suck.
So that's the regular one.
Got you a present.
Can I open it right now?
Yes.
Oh.
I thought you could hang it on the wall here.
I love that.
It's like your dad's looking over the bar.
Aw, thank you, Jess.
It's really nice.
All right.
Now to be fair, I've had some sex dreams about you, too.
First, there was the one where I was a spider and instead of legs it was penises.
No, I'm out.
It was eight penises...
Yeah, I know.
Oh.
You were there, too.
I'm out.
Was I there?
And I'm out.
Oh, that would've been so cool.
How do you spell "boudoir"?
I'm so far off, I'm not getting the auto-correct.
So which girl are you texting now, the coffin-maker?
Oh, you're thinking about Jamie.
Nah, nah. She kinda disappeared into her busy season, so this is Rhonda.
Oh, is this the girl with the yogurt mouth?
That's Simi Valley Sue.
Rhonda is Willem Dafoe's assistant.
No, she's n... Rhonda's the army reservist.
Boy, you are on such a tear with the ladies, Winston.
(whistles) Your boy cleanin' up.
Not thinking about Aly.
And Rhonda, you know, she's cool, man.
I'm having the most fun with her.
She really keeps me on my toes.
And y'all know Winston love being on his toes.
Definitely, definitely.
You know, actually, she's poppin' by later.
You guys will get to meet her before the wedding.
Before the... she's coming to our wedding?
Yes. Winston, you're gonna bring this flavor of the month to our wedding?
Well, I was...
She's gonna be in wedding photos?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, gather round, grandchildren.
Look at Uncle Winston, and this woman who is not Willem Dafoe's assistant.
Well, I am excited to meet her.
Can you tell us some basics?
Her-her last name, her rank...
Yeah, I don't know any of that stuff.
I've only been on two dates with her, so...
Two dates, how do we even know that she's fighting for our army?
Hey! Are we looking at the owner of a new used car?
No. (scoffs) I wish.
Billy from Car County started playing misogynist bingo with me as soon as I walked in the door.
He called me "dollface."
Started pointing out all the room in the trunk for my shopping bags.
Then, he explained four-wheel drive to me.
I don't need four-wheel drive explained.
It's very well named.
Like World Series of Poker champion, Chris Moneymaker.
Continue, though.
Okay, you know how you get back at this guy?
Huh. You do the entire thing online.
You set up an e-mail address, but under a dude's name.
Yes. I love it.
Help! Help!
There's some lunatic after me! (yelling)
Oh, my God!
Call 911!
Call 911!
Please, somebody help me.
(everyone yelling at once)
Winston! Winston, go...!
Jess: Oh, my God! Stay there! Wait!
Don't pull it out.
(laughing)
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
(both laughing)
You just got Rhonda'd.
(laughing)
Rhonda'd!
(Rhonda and Winston laughing)
What's your last name?
I'm almost done with my "Jeff Day" e-mail to the dealer.
I've constructed a very rich back story for him.
Listen to this, listen to this.
Okay.
He wrote this while on break from his job, which is hanging telephone line.
He should have a desk job by now, but the ground has always been trouble for him.
Yeah, the poles are safer.
And sometimes, at dusk, he can see his buddies from Desert Storm dancing in the static.
That's beautiful.
Yeah, it's okay.
So you need a dude pass before you send it off, right?
No, I don't need a dude pass.
No, no. Listen to this.
My wife is on my nuts.
I need two grand off the MSRP.
Go, Clips.
Go, Clips! Good, yeah.
Hey, Nick, if anyone's gonna give Jess a dude pass, it's gonna be me.
A dude pass.
Not a pretty-boy pass.
Not a "I make my money from my mind" pass.
Not a "I look like the cute benchwarmer on an NBA team, "but I'm not good enough to play."
Are you done?
After I take my dude pass, why don't you take a short guy pass?
Why don't you take a snake voice pass?
Is it frustrating for you when you go to concerts and you can't see the stage 'cause you're so short?
It can be.
It can be!
I know we're in an awkward situation.
I used to date Nick, now I'm dating Sam, again.
I thought we were over all this.
And now every time I turn around, you guys are in some kind of turf w*r.
Are we in a turf w*r? I didn't even notice, you punk.
This can't go on forever.
Let's just get our emotions out there.
Let's just express ourselves...
I'm good. I don't...
I got nothing.
Yeah, I mean, everything's fine.
You feel good?
Yeah, I feel great.
You feel good, I feel good.
Yeah, I got nothing to talk about, yeah.
We're good, man.
I don't feel nothin' towards you man.
You can spit on the bottom of my shoe, dude.
(Winston laughing)
Let's...
Schmidt: This is what you want for our nuptials?
Shenanigans?
This is our wedding, Cece, not "Ernest Goes to Our Wedding."
Can't we just revoke Winston's plus one?
Okay, look, I'm sure there's more to Rhonda than just pranks, all right?
We owe it to Winston to get to know her.
Well, let's start at the beginning.
Tell us about your childhood. Where'd you grow up?
Well, I grew up in Baltimore.
Oh.
I don't like to talk about it around new people, but we were homeless.
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
It was tough.
We didn't have money for food, clothes, toys.
My brother and I adopted a rat.
I remember, we called the rat Singular Wireless.
He was sweet.
Until he ate my brother's pinkie toe clean off.
(quietly): What?
He bit it like a baby carrot.
Just (snapping).
It woke me up.
That snap, that snap.
In the end, we laughed about it, 'cause what else can you do?
Just Singular being Singular.
Gosh darn it.
(sighing)
He ran away after a while... my brother, not the rat... he didn't get far, obviously, not with nine toes.
Listen, it wasn't a great childhood, and I know that I come on strong, but I guess, if I can scare people with my pranks, then I know I'm not the only one who's scared.
What a cruel, terrible world we live in.
I had no idea.
I'm so, so, so, sorry.
(both guffawing)
You're stupid, Schmidt.
And you're-you're stupid, too, Cece, Stupid.
Okay, wait, so the en... the en... the entire story is a lie?
Rhon. Da'd.
Pow-pow.
Need a little more of this.
Anybody else want some, uh, wine?
Oh, no, thanks.
I salted it.
(Rhonda guffaws)
You salted the wine? How is that even a prank?
You just told her that you salted it before she took a sip.
Unless of course that the prank is that there's no salt in it.
(spits)
(guffawing)
Yes, there's salt.
There's most definitely salt in that.
(laughing)
This is delightful.
Mr. Day, I, too, love Sons of Anarchy.
You drive a pretty hard bargain.
I agree to your terms!
You just have to sign the papers in person.
I'm at the dealership for another hour.
Ah, I did not think this through.
(sighing, groaning)
Nick... I have h*t a snag in my car buying.
I'm not surprised you came to me.
I heard you and, uh, Dr. Trap-Jaw last night, and he climaxes like a woman.
That was me.
Then you sound like a woman when you climax.
I am a woman.
What's your point?
We're still on your point.
I'm waiting for you to wrap it up.
My point is... your car deal went south, and so you need Nick Miller to twist some nips for you, yeah?
Nope. The nips have already been twisted.
All I need right now is someone to pretend to be Jeff Day.
And I would ask Sam, but he's in a procedure all day.
He's de-webbing some kid's toes.
It sounds whimsical, but it's actually very serious.
Why would you go to him?
He cannot close this deal for you, Jess.
The deal has already been closed.
Right now, I just need, literally, any man.
(chuckling)
If I could wish a mannequin to life, I would.
(both laughing)
Oh, Jessica.
You understand that fate fused that kid's toes together.
And Dr. Sam is the man for that job, but I'm the man for this job.
So if you excuse me, let me get my Julius Pepperwood disguise.
Wait, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I just need you to pretend to be Jeff Day.
Well, I need some sort of disguise.
Absolutely not.
What about a mustache?
That's a disguise.
Not if I grow one.
We're in the car in ten minutes.
You gonna grow a mustache in ten minutes?
No man could do that.
Scientifically impossible.
Hey, I guess science always wins, right?
See ya in the car.
Jess: All right, now remember, Jeff Day is a lovable schnook, who makes sausage in his spare time.
You work for the phone company, so you call the phones "units."
All right, what's my back story?
Units, that's good. Uh, you're my wife.
You spend all day making sausages, and clucking with the other hens on the kitchen unit.
No, no. I'm a disgraced ice-skating sensation.
I got ex-communicated from the sport for protesting that nudie fabric.
And then I broke my butt.
Right, and which toe is webbed?
Ugh, Nick, that's real life.
Ugh. This is gonna be a disaster.
Abort, abort.
Dollface!
You're back!
Hi. I am, I am.
Um, I believe you've been e-mailing with my husband Jeff.
Jeff Day.
Lover of meats, enemy of nonsense.
Put her there. (laughs)
Nice mustache.
My guy.
All right.
Oh, excuse me for a minute.
I have to go feed the meter.
Uh, excu... before you go, can you please fill us in on all active pranks at this table?
I think you found them all, okay?
Relax.
Oh, wait! Winston...
I put a watch battery in your huevos rancheros.
(Rhonda laughs)
In the huevos?
No, you did not.
Winston, she's been sitting down this whole time.
Does she have someone working with her in the kitchen?
Can you explain to me how that's funny?
'Cause you could have cracked a molar or choked to death.
(laughing) It's hilarious.
'Cause what if I choke on the battery?
You know what I mean?
Or if the battery breaks open inside of me, you know? and causes all kinds of... no?
What-what? You guys don't like her?
Mm...
Uh...
And I mean, look, I get it.
She might not be the one, but come on, at least we're having fun, right?
We gave her a chance, okay, Winston?
But I am scared to touch my food, and I don't want to feel that way at our wedding.
Yes.
Winston, it brings me no joy to do this, whatsoever, but I'm revoking your plus one.
You gave me that plus one, which means I can bring anyone.
Plus one means plus anyone.
For the Schmidt-Parikh wedding, it's a plus the one.
You just had that one locked and loaded, didn't you?
Excuse me, sir? Here's your check.
Oh, my God!
That's my face. Why is that my face?
Ha-ha!
(laughing)
Winston: No, no, no, no.
Save it.
It's gonna be wasted on these two.
Let's get out of here.
How did she get a mask of my face?
Oh... (scoffs) did they just stick us with the bill?
N... no.
She left, like, $300.
Who does this prank?
Thanks for meeting with us.
I don't know... what made me think I could have possibly bought a car by myself.
You were right to get your hubby involved.
Now, Mr. Day, your mind seemed pretty made up over e-mail.
Look, Billy, I wish, uh, we could get twin hogs, but then the missus would stop giving me that sweet potato pie.
You know Jeff Day, I need my sweet potato pie every four hours.
Ain't that right, baby?
I married a hungry man.
Billy: If you're open to other options, we just got a consignment of vehicles that we are looking to move at rock bottom prices.
I had my heart set on that cute little car that you showed me in that e-mail you wrote.
(chuckles)
Had a really big makeup mirror, and I sure was excited about it.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, buh-buh...
There's no harm in hearing what the catch of the day is, right?
No harm.
Exactly.
Billy, Jeff needs to take his omega-3 pill.
Could you grab us a glass of water?
Not a problem.
I got a bad ticker myself.
Not... uh... I had him right where I wanted him.
He's trying to bait and switch us, and you're gobbling it up like an old king with a turkey leg.
You're leaving money on the table.
I can smell it.
Watch. I'm gonna string him along, and then I'm going to get you a better deal.
He thinks he's fishing for me.
Nah, I'm fishing for him, but from the water.
You're in way over your head.
Right where a fish wants to be.
Here's your water, and... take as many mouse pads as you want.
Quit stalling me.
Smart.
Tell me about the secret stash, Billy.
These vehicles are a lot bigger than what you were e-mailing about.
Well, a car can never be too big, and a pot can never be too sweet.
(mouthing)
I hear ya, so I guess, don't waste your time with anything smaller than a two liter?
Two liter?
I want a car, not a Mountain Dew.
(all laughing)
You want to send this girl out on to the road with a little bulk, in case she gets h*t, or more likely, hits someone, am I right? (laughs)
While she's text messaging.
They can't stop.
They're beautiful, but... (boinging)
(laughing): I like you.
Honey, don't forget how much research you put in.
You don't want to throw that all away, like I did with my skating career.
Jeff, you clearly know your way around an engine.
What are we talkin', 5.0?
You want the bird to sing in my underpants, I'm gonna need double digits.
Oh, yeah, Jeff. baby!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
It's gonna sing.
Boom.
(cell phone chiming)
You get me.
(Billy and Nick laughing, making goofy noises)
Excuse me. I have to take this.
It's Oksana Baiul. Honey, get the car I want, or the only pie you'll be eating is out of the garbage.
(laughs)
Hey, I thought you were de-webbing.
Well, it took less time than I thought.
Yeah, he only wanted his big toe free, so he could wear flip-flops.
How's the new car?
Ugh!
Don't make a thing out of it, but I had to ask Nick to be Jeff Day.
You asked Nick for help, not me?
Well, you were in surgery, and he was the only person I could find, but he's screwing it up so much that I really wish I'd "Reverse-Tootsie'd."
Of course he's screwing up. He's a little human porkchop.
I'm on my way.
Wait, don't come. Don't come.
I could be Jeff Day.
I just need to find a fake mustache.
What is it with you guys and mustaches?
Look, I have the situation un-under control.
Cutting Winston's plus one creates a real ripple effect.
Jason gets bumped from 14.
Ruthie gets bumped from 6, landing Tyler right next to the bar, which feels like tempting fate.
Yeah, you know what? The more I think about it, we may have judged Rhonda a little too harshly.
Maybe you're right. You know what?
If Winston is happy, with Lady Kutcher, we should support him.
What's the worst that can happen?
Maybe she'll put some cellophane over the toilet bowls.
Hopefully, my Uncle Randy doesn't get (door opens, closes) fired up at the buffet.
Hey, guys.
We were just talking, and we're sorry about earlier.
Oh, listen, I've been thinking about what you said, and maybe you're right.
I want the woman that I bring to your wedding to be special.
Special like... my wife.
(laughing)
Both: We got married!
(laughing)
What?!
You got married!
Well, look, you guys said to be more serious, and nothing's more serious than holy matrimony.
I mean, this is what you guys wanted, right?
No! No! This is insane.
And we were totally out of bounds in the first place.
We never should have interfered in your love life.
No.
Got you again!
Boom!
That's what we needed to hear.
Huh? Wait. What?
What, so you... wait a minute.
You're not actually married?
(laughing)
Oh, thank... thank goodness.
It was... it was just a prank.
It was just a prank. Okay.
Just a prank.
How did you guys get such a realistic marriage certificate?
Does it look realistic?
Oh, that's good. They did a good job on it, 'cause it's a hundred percent real.
We got you.
We found a same-day chapel, and then we got married, as a prank.
Wha-uh...?
So-so you really did get married?
Y'all can't keep up.
How is really getting married, Winston, a prank?
The authenticity of the marriage is what makes it a great prank.
Come on, guys.
Yeah.
Says who?
Hold on. wh... no, please.
Let them explain. Please explain.
We've already explained it.
A simple prank is a strong prank.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Let's just say... I don't know, I told you that I cut my pinkie finger off, and then I actually cut my pinkie finger off.
Rhonda: Mm.
Is that a prank?
Is that a prank?
Well, I would not see that coming.
Okay.
Different direction.
Let-let's say that I-I told you that I invested all of my money into boogie boards.
That's just a lie.
And then I took you to my accountant's office, and sitting behind the desk was just a little crab in sunglasses.
Hmm, still sounds like a lie.
And then my real accountant came out and showed you the books and, in fact, I had invested all of money in boogie boards.
That's definitely a prank.
Yeah, that would get me.
That's-that's a good one.
That's crazy, yeah.
That's a good one.
Rhonda: That's a good one.
I don't understand this.
Okay, so this is like a lifelong prank?
Oh, no, no, we're getting it annulled tomorrow.
Oh, right.
Rhonda: Tonight's the honeymoon.
Listen, a little marriage advice...
I would know because I'm married... a happy wife, uh, a happy life.
Have you heard the saying before?
Mm.
I'm questioning everything right now.
I swear, I swear... I swear...
He's about 5'10".
Maybe a mustache.
Sometimes he just sits in the bathroom buying music.
Do you think you could check in there?
Is that him in the RV?
Oh, no.
He wouldn't be in an RV.
He is, he is. That's him in the RV.
You look natural behind the wheel of that baby.
I felt like myself for the first time in my life.
Jess: Hey, Jeff.
Where were you, and why weren't you answering your unit?
Excuse me.
Excu... yeah.
Good stuff, Billy. Thank you.
Ow.
Is this you doing your plan?
I don't know.
He keeps changing things up.
He's very good at his job.
Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Jeff Day.
My brother.
Geoff with a "G."
Yeah, I came as soon as I could.
Jess: I don't know why.
I explicitly told you not to.
Nick: Yeah, why don't you take a hike? No one needs you here.
The reason she came to me first.
Sorry, Billy.
There's a little bit of bad blood between my brother and my husband.
She may have come to you for help, but you're clearly not getting the job done, which is why she'll always come back for my help.
As soon as you get a helping of my help, you're never the same.
No one helps me better than I help myself.
I told you if you'd just guide me.
Let's not get into that now.
I don't really know what you guys are talking about, but are you still buying the RV?
No! I'm not buying an RV.
Honey, he's giving us a great price.
Why don't you get those numbers?
Don't get those numbers.
Why don't you go get them?
Stay right there.
Why do women always bring your drama in here?
Oh, you're blaming me?
Hah! All right.
I'd like to test-drive my car right now.
I showed you where all the mirrors are, right?
(engine revs)
(Sam and Nick screaming)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
(all yelling at once)
Now you guys are listening to me!
Get ready for the scariest test-drive of your lives.
♪ Simply the best... ♪
I don't care if you're hot.
I'm always cold!
Nick: Slow down!
Sam: Oh, man, this speed...
Nick: God!
Billy: Oh, God!
You're gonna give me what I want.
I can't give you a thing until I talk to my manager.
You're talking to me. I know you need to get rid of this 2017.
It's the end of the month.
I know you haven't made your nut.
Okay, I'll give you the original deal.
The one from the e-mail.
You'll do better.
I want Bluetooth.

Sam: No, no, no, no, no! No!
Whoa! Okay, okay... Okay-kay-kay...
I want to feel like I'm driving a spaceship.
Anything you want.
Nick: That's impressive.
Oh, that was impressive.
You're really good at this, Jess.
Really good.
Now for you two, jokers.
I'm sorry I went rogue, Jess.
I'm sorry, too.
You told me not to come, but I did.
Don't apologize to me.
Talk to each other.
Figure out a way to both be in my life.
Otherwise, I'm gonna turn the heat up to 90.
I'm gonna turn the radio to Pink.
And I am going to find a cobblestone street.
Oh, no, please don't. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up, Billy!
You have a little boy's name.
You are so mean!
Now solve it.
Deal with your emotions.
Jess, you don't get it.
The stuff between Sam and I is deep guy stuff.
It's untalkable.
That's right. I punched him twice.
And I stole his girlfriend.
We're talking about adultery and v*olence.
That part of the male brain has not been civilized.
So you're just gonna feud forever?
I'll teach my sons to hate his sons and I expect the same from him.
You got it.
Thank you.
If you insist on hating each other, do it while I'm not around.
The moment I walk in the room, I want some convincing dude on dude friendship stuff.
I want high-fives.
I want golf tips.
When a hot waitress walks by, I want to see a real nudge-nudge.
Hubba, hubba.
Billy: Keep your hands on the wheel!
Nick: Easy! Jess!

I can do it if he can.
I can do it even if he can't do it.
(laughs)
Are you wearing a fake mustache?
Yeah.
Thanks for coming to my annulment, guys.
Yeah, well, we should get to know your ex-wife.
Yeah, like, did she make that mask of my face, or does she have a mask guy?
Rhonda's in here.
Is it weird that I'm a little nervous?
Yes.
Yeah.
Rhonda.
Will you make me the most hilarious man in the world by being my ex...
(all screaming)
Come on!
Rhonda's a boy! Rhonda's a boy!
You ain't Rhonda.
Winston Bishop?
Y-y-yes.
I'm supposed to play you this.
Oh, here we go.
Winston, I think we should postpone our annulment.
Until you put the pieces of your mind back together.
(laughing, imitates sh**ting g*n)
I wish I could see your face right now.
But I can't, because I got called up for duty.
Bye-bye, hubby.
(nervous laugh) That's...
Wait, so we're still married.
Yeah.
But then how... but then how you gon... we were... we were co-pranksters.
How you gonna prank your co-prankster?
Hmm... I get it.
I finally get the prank now, man.
You got Rhonda'd.
I made Billy my baby.
I made that little bitch a bottle, right guys?
You did a great job, honey.
You did awesome.
What a terrific hybrid vehicle.
I'm glad that the previous owner scraped off all the "Co-exist" bumper stickers.
So I have no options.
I have no options. Okay, well...
Sleep with both eyes open, you idiot.
It's one eye, you idiot.
Cut your chance in half, you idiot.
Idiot.
Hey, don't bill me for this.
Sorry, that was my divorce lawyer.
What?!
Yeah, it's been a day. So I got married.
Then my wife was shipped overseas.
And I remain married.
What? Who? When? How? What?
Yeah, he married Rhonda. As a prank.
Wait, you're really married, Winston?
I-I'm not sure I understand the prank.
The prank is, is that Winston's on the hook to send care packages to Germany for the next six months.
Rhonda'd.

I'm trying to get in touch with Sam... you know, to clear the air...
Get out of my life.
Why isn't he responding?
I'm just gonna go out on a crazy limb here... maybe it's because you got his girlfriend to dump him?
I'm not being weird about it.
I just texted him three times.
(sighs, groans)
And I called him.
He wasn't there.
I left him a sensible voice mail.
To lighten the mood, I told a little story about how the first-graders' pet rabbit got stuck in the lawn mower and I had to...
I had to collect it.
That's a terrible story.
Colonel FlapEars?
Wow.
Unbelievable.
I had to park two blocks away, like an animal.
The new bar, Presh, is doing valet and they took all of our spots.
I've been saying for months that we need valet.
Is there anything sexier than tossing your keys in the general direction of someone you care nothing about?
"Keep it running."
Hi. I'm looking for Jessica Day.
Oh, right here. You've just been served.
What?!
What?
(gasps) A restraining order?!
From Sam.
Oof...
I'm not a restraining order person.
A restraining order. That's worse than herpes.
When I find Sam... (laughs)
I'm gonna k*ll him.
You can't find Sam.
'Cause you have a restraining order.
Winston. You have to help me with this.
Sam is the only one who can drop this charge.
But the magic of a restraining order is that you can't talk to him.
And that... that is human drama.
(indistinct chatter)
Schmidt: Wow.
Tasteful, hip...
I mean, nothing matches, yet nothing is random.
That's just a framed toupee on the wall and it friggin' works.
Cece: What are these bartenders wearing?
They look like Civil w*r surgeons.
This is a very professional establishment.
Let me do the talking.
You don't think I talk professional good?
You don't think I professional talk good?
What am I saying weird there?
You speak poorly, professionally.
Okay.
Hey, hey. I'm Connie, the owner.
You're the nutmeg wholesaler?
Me? No, I'm not the nutmeg wholesaler.
You have a nutmeg wholesaler vibe.
That's what it is.
I've been trying to figure it out for years.
You totally look like a nutmeg wholesaler.
Me no nutmeg...
Connie: How can I help you?
Connie, hello.
Very nice to meet you.
We are both local entrepreneurs, as you are.
Uh, we co-own the bar up the street, and there is a business situation that we would like to bring to your attention...
Yeah, your stupid valet is taking all the spots in front of our bar, and it's time for it to come to an end.
It's not sittin' well with us folks over at the Griffin.
What's a griffin?
What is... wait, what is the Griffin?
The Griffin is the name of the bar that we own together, you buffoon.
You don't know the name of our bar?
Why don't we...
We don't have a sign. We should have a sign.
Is this the time for this?
I feel like this is a conversation I don't need to be a part of.
My valet is totally legal.
But thanks for stopping by.
Maybe, you know, maybe I'll stop by your bar.
I'll just, like, knock on doors until... until I find you.
Uh, please don't leave. Pl...
Okay, leave. We'll d-discuss this...
I don't like this woman.
Hey, uh, where should I put this, uh, nutmeg?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
The lady's name is Connie.
She's o-over that way.
I'm here to overturn a restraining order.
I brought lots of excellent character references.
In the words of Ms. Cheryl Riggins of Portland, Oregon: "When the school sewage line broke, Jessica was the only student who rolled up her sleeves, grabbed a pail and went to work. She should be tested for hepatitis immediately. Immediately."
That's not the one...
Uh, sorry about that, Riggs.
Uh, Jessica, you better be here because you wrote a song you wanted me to listen to.
I just don't get why Sam would do this.
I'm not dangerous.
Hey.
Friend face. That was cute.
Cop face. Girl, sit yo' ass down.
And use the word "allegedly" when discussing Sam.
I do not need Internal Affairs crawling all up in my holes.
What if I typed up a note and left it on his car?
Oh, you stop it, Jess.
Yeah, but I...
Let it lie.
Okay.
No letters.
Jess: This would've been a better plan if I knew what he drives.
(sighs) A lot of black cars.
Cars should have people's names on them.
Ugh, it's so stupid.
(Sam speaking indistinctly)
(car alarm beeping)
(grunts)
Sam: Well, have a good one.
See you later.
See you tomorrow.
No. No.
Sam drives a truck?
(engine starts)
Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez.
Well, this is not my fault.
Hey, Jess, I'm at work.
Is this a cop situation or a friend situation?
Both. What would you say if I told you I was in the bed of Sam's pickup?
Allegedly.
I said "allegedly."
Okay, good. So you're not in the back of a truck.
No, I am.
I'm-I'm, I am "allegedly" in-in Sam's truck.
Jess, you seem to be confused. Here's how it works.
Um, allegedly, Ferguson and I are eating pasta in a hot air balloon. Realistically...
Winston, I'm in the back of Sam's truck right now.
I wanted Sam to know that I'm not crazy.
Wait, shh, he's changing his music.
♪ Can't keep my hands to myself... ♪
Selena Gomez, interesting.
Ugh. (grunting)
Jess, what is happening right now?
(voice vibrating)
Cece: Connie, with her fancy cocktails.
I can make a fancy cocktail.
Sure you can.
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?
What the hell is all this stuff?
We need to make some... some real improvements around here, if we're gonna compete with Presh.
Improvements?!
Just minor tweaks, okay?
Like a jukebox that doesn't catch f*re sometimes.
Separate olive and cherry trays.
A toilet that flushes down and not up.
Okay, that's an attraction and a lot of our customers actually like that.
Why are you so eager to change our bar?
We should be ruining their bar.
We should cut their power.
We should paint a door where there isn't a door.
We're not talented enough to paint a realistic door, Nick.
All right, okay. Try this.
I call it "Whiskey Business," but surprise!
There's vodka in that.
Boom.
Thank you, honey.
(gagging)
Come on.
(clears throat)
It's a little chunky.
(clears throat)
Tastes like loose chili, a little bit.
(sighs) Yeah, I'm gonna go get some fresher ingredients.
Okay, you do that, hon. (retching)
Can we please stop competing with these fad bars?
I hate fads, man.
Nick, just a small little piece of important, friendly advice: you need to give your Ds more emphasis.
Fads.
What I said.
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
By hating fads?
That's... maybe just change it to "trendy" bars.
Or "hip" bars.
We need to stop competing with trendy, hip fad bars?
(sighs)
Okay.
All right. I need a drink.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Somebody cut our soda.
Oh, my God, who would do such a thing?
It's Connie, Schmidt.
Well, how would she have gotten in here?
I mean, she couldn't...
She took our bubbles, Schmidt!
We have to retaliate.
What do we look like, Tonya Harding's henchmen?
Who am I, Jeff Gillooly?
Either you care enough about this bar to fight for it, or you don't.
Because I care enough. I'll fight.
Let's do this. What are we gonna do?
We're gonna h*t her where it hurts.
I'm in.
Not the vag*na.
We're gonna go after the bar.
Uh, yes, that's ri... N... There was not even a single part of me that thought you were talking about the vag*na.
The bar.
The b...
Yes, the...
All right, I'm gonna take over the plan.
Good. Yeah, good.
It was getting on top of me.
(whispering loudly): Winston, sorry.
Sorry, I h*t some potholes, and then we got on the freeway, and then some schoolkids started throwing pencils at me, (bell rings) then we passed a cop, and I had to pretend to be a mannequin.
What is that noise?
Hang on a second, Winston.
(gasps) Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Where are you? What is that...?
Aah!

Connie cut our soda line.
So we take a fish, and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar.
The whole place is gonna smell like a whale's ass.
Not just any fish either.
A branzino. You know...
Freaking branzino.
She thinks she's hip and classy.
Wait till she tangles with the most highly regarded table fish in all the world.
I was trying to cut a runaway olive, and I cut the soda line.
(scoffs)
Why? Why'd you...?
I-I didn't think you'd actually notice, to be honest with you.
What are we going to do now?
Deny, deny, deny.
There's no way she'll know it's us.
Oh, hey, guys. I just came by to return your fish.
I've never seen that fish before in my life.
Ooh, is that a branzino?
Whoever bought that fish has impeccable taste.
Nick: I mean, I guess they kind of look like...
Nah, that doesn't even... No, that's...
Really?
Yeah, good luck finding those guys.
Of course it's us, you idiot.
Why'd you admit it?!
Schmidt: We're right there!
We might as well be wearing name tags!
You're so stupid, man.
You're so stupid, moron.
You're a bad guy to partner up in this stuff.
Schmidt: Give us a chance to, first, apologize and, second, give you a little bit of context here.
You see, (chuckles) we thought that you att*cked our bar.
Why would I att*ck a bar that has no one in it?
And if I did want to att*ck you, I would just report you for one of your numerous health code violations.
Some improvements definitely need to be made.
We... we found a d*ad fox in the keg room the other week.
We're not sure it was a fox.
Uh, it was an animal that had d*ed in our keg room that was bigger than a cat but smaller than a big dog...
A word of advice: do not mess with me.
This past year has been the worst year of my life.
First, my cat d*ed.
Then my husband left me for our neighbor, and so I had to listen to them having sex through our bedroom wall every single night.
And then he left my neighbor for my mother, which is, like, a very long story that I don't really want to get into.
Then my other cat d*ed.
Then I ran over a dog while I was driving to the vet with our d*ad cat on my lap.
You guys messed with my business... now I'm gonna have to destroy you.
If I may... ask... how and when you're planning on destroying us.
Any information would be... would be greatly appreciated.
Yeah, 'cause then we could prepare for it a little bit.
It's gonna be soon.
And when you least expect it.
That's something.
Thank...
You followed me into a car wash!
That is so not...
Okay, I have a...
What I want to say to you...
I have a lot of things I want to say to you.
I have a restraining order against you.
I'm not dangerous, and you don't need to be afraid of me.
Clearly.
Okay, (sighs) well, I guess, um... nice seeing you.
I'm gonna get to my next engagement.
Where are we, by the way?
I'll just check my little... my little thing.
It's actually not functioning.
(groaning)
Old gal got a little bit wet.
Eh, feed it to the birds.

Oh! Oh...
That got me.
Yeah, that got me.

Get in the car.
Damn it.
Yeah, I get it.
It's too sad to watch.
♪
Clear.
Schmidt: Clear.
There are no signs of foul play back here.
Also, I feel fantastic.
That's because you're very drunk, Cece.
You're supposed to be spitting them out.
How would she poison our booze anyway?
We've been here the entire time.
Who knows?
You saw how intense she was.
We're at a state of high alert.
And, frankly, I don't trust your coat.
It's too warm to wear a coat like that.
Unless you're hiding a fish. You hiding a fish?
All I got's a chicken.
Okay, don't trust you.
Out you go.
Thanks for coming in again, Eric.
(scoffs) This bar is outrageous.
I'm so sorry it's not like your favorite bar, Presh.
You know my favorite bar is Heshe's Tango in Phuket.
Their coconut mojitos literally gave me an orgasm.
I had to buy new pants.
(mimicking): "I love Presh.
Presh has napkins and... walnuts."
Is that meant to be me?
No, I'm doing a spot-on Winston.
Because I do not talk like that.
Do you even like the Griffin?
What is the Gri...?
Are you kidding me?
It's... uh, the Griffin's our bar.
I knew that.
He loves it!
What the hell are you talking about, you booze hound?
We lost her a long time ago.
Cece, honey, drink some water, okay?
Nope.
Hey, man, do you know how hard I have worked at this bar in the past year?
I've k*lled myself for this place.
A year ago, we were in a sinkhole.
We were in the red.
But now, because of me, because of my work, we're in the white.
What's "the white"?
The white. Breaking even.
Oh, we're breaking even?
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
How wonderful. And let's just stop there.
Where will we invest our extra zero percent?
I know, how about in the toilet?
The same toilet that flushes upwards.
Wait! What if this... this was Connie's plan the entire time?
Okay, she knew we would be so paranoid that we would drive all the customers out of the bar and start fighting with each other.
Connie emptied this entire bar without lifting a finger.
Nick, you may not like her, but you must admit she is brilliant.
I don't have to admit that.
But I will say you've made something crystal clear.
I'm alone.
I'm all alone.
Oh, here we go.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna handle this myself, all alone.
I'm gonna call a meeting of the families...
Oh, Lord.
...a sit-down with all the businesses on the block, and you are not invited.
Okay, fine.
Shh.
Just take the rejection.
Hi. Oh, you guys open?
Yeah, yeah, we are. What can I get you to drink?
Ah, no, nothing.
I'm just here to see the "up" toilet.
Yeah, you are.
Look, I just want you to know, when you drop me off, that's it... I'm... not bothering you ever again.
Good.
I just want to say one thing...
Please stop talking.
(horn blaring)
Oh! Geez!
(Jess screaming)
(both screaming)
Aah!

No! We figured it out.
Jessica Day, take your hands off of this man.
Dr. Sam (friend face): good to see you.
(Cop face): 300 feet away from her.
When did you become a cop, dude?
Oh, not too long ago.
Congrats.
Thank you. I appreciate that. It's nothing, you know.
I get to do a lot of cool stuff on the job.
I once slid across the hood of a car.
I scratched it all up.
I didn't have to pay for it, you know.
'Cause I'm a cop, so...
(Winston laughs)
300 feet away.
I've gathered the families here today, to end this terrible, terrible, unnecessary w*r.
So, thank you.
Connie and I have had our battles, but today we make our peace.
She's of the north.
She's the owner of Presh.
What is this?
I only came because you said you were suing me for what I did, which, by the way, was nothing.
I lied to ensure your presence.
Good Lord.
Over here, we have Peter Verrebian.
(muffled): Yes.
Nick: Enjoying the pasta.
He is also the owner of Produce-slash-
Cold Beer-slash-Ice.
Peter, I know that's what the sign above your market says.
Is that the name of your establishment?
Yes.
Very creative.
Oh, and AnaLysa from AnaLysa's Nails wanted to be here, but she couldn't find somebody to cover her register.
And if you've ever gone in that place, it's messy.
Like, it's not a great... establishment.
How did things get this far, everybody?
This is so weird.
Thank you for the spaghetti.
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?
I wish we were all so polite.
Schmidt: I'd like to say something.
I don't need you here, Schmidt.
Connie... you know, Presh may have booths made of reclaimed wood and carefully curated artisanal flatware... but this bar will have something that your fancy place will never have.
What's that?
Nick Miller.
Oh. Well.
No, we'll never have that.
Of course I'm proud that this bar breaks even, but I think that you can do better than that.
I didn't just invest in this bar, Nick.
I invested in you.
No, you didn't.
You don't have equity in me, and we're...
I get it.
Hey, Connie... yours isn't the only bar on the block that has valet, starting immediately.
(sniffling quietly)
We have valet, kiddo.
You got valet.
(voice breaking): You got valet.
This is beautiful.
The valet's yours. The valet's yours.
Um... are they in love?
Yes. Very much so.
Okay. Hey, guys, um... let's just call a truce and end this.
If nothing else, so I can stop dealing with you.
I'll drink to that.
You got it.
Connie (sighing deeply): Okay.
A toast?
To us. Salud!
Okay.
This is good. This is really good.
Uh, yeah. My buddy Andy makes it in his basement.
I'm not allowed to say anything else about it, though.
Wow, I'm not kidding.
I think this is the best whiskey that I've ever had.
You want to go out with me sometime?
What? No. No.
No, no, no. Never.
Never.
Nick: But the whole back and forth with, like, the fish and getting mad at each other...
Never. Never.
When you came back and threw the fish down...?
Nothing...?
Where did you get there, from "I like this whiskey" to...?
What the hell was that?
You know what? Let it go. Let it go.
This was, this is my mistake. It was a misread...
I would sooner make love to Peter and his mouthful of spaghetti.
(smacking): Pass.
Okay, Peter.
Cheers.
Winston: 298, 299...
Watch out for the lamp.
And that's 300, right there. Wait here.
I'm dropping the restraining order. This isn't necessary.
I'll determine what's necessary; I'm a cop.
Stop! There's no more restraining order.
And no more cop face.
Girl, this is my friend face.
Honestly, I can't tell the difference.
Well, there is no difference.
That's why I have to announce it.
And as your friend, Winston, I just want to make sure that you two have thought things through.
That you're not rushing into things, you know?
You don't hurt each other again.
I'm thinking, maybe, as your friend, maybe... you should be restraining yourselves.
Because of the restraining order?
Look, we've grown up a lot.
We've made mistakes and we've learned from them.
Jess, nobody takes out a restraining order unless they think that they're in danger.
Winston's right.
What?
You're dangerous.
I mean, you're dangerous to me.
You want to know why I got the restraining order?
(inhales deeply)
'Cause I couldn't stop thinking about you either.
I didn't trust myself not to call you and start this whole thing up again.
You know, you-you've changed, Jess, and that's great, I just... I haven't.
And I'm still mad at you and... that's gonna take some time.
I think the, uh, best, smartest thing for us to do is to just... (inhales) say good-bye.

What does Selena Gomez always say?
"Take your things and go..."

Good-bye, Jess.
Good-bye, Sam.

No germ can live in a body that is 65% beer.
Nick, are you eating raisins from my purse?

Yep. Only hens, though, obviously.
Banyon Canyon has a strict "zero cocks" policy.
I like how it... it encourages the chickens to stay inside but doesn't force them.
In line with our philosophy.

Genevieve: Sam, I want you to meet Jess.
This is the candidate we were discussing in the shower.
Yeah.
Jess, this is Sam, my partner.
Hey, Jess.
You're a doctor for children.
Uh, it's, you know, mostly paperwork.
How do you always look so beautiful in the morning?
(grunts)
(Nick groans)
Oh, my God.
You could have k*lled him.
(strained): I'm gonna kick your ass, man.
Hi, Sam.
Hi.
Have you met before?
We... Yeah, we've met.
We did. Yes, that's right, we met, we met.
(laughing): How funny.
Um, a bunch of times.
A lot of times. Very many. A lot of times.
We met a lot... Yeah.
Sometimes in the day, sometimes... in the, uh, nighttime.
Oh.
It was, you know...
Yeah, we, I mean...
Yeah.
Oh.
Bye, Jess.
Nice to see you.
The fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.
Okay, let's make this quick.
I need to work on my presentation.
It's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled, "I Hope You're Sitting Down for This."
'Cause it's chairs.
Yeah.
At which point you would laugh if you weren't so preoccupied with your date.
Okay, Winston, what are you wearing?
Well, you know, I don't want to overthink it.
It's just coffee, so...
So you're going to just dress like you did today, which apparently happened during a solar eclipse in a land of no mirrors.
Good note. Strong note.
Winston, listen to me.
Yeah.
This is the first date since the... since the Aly heartbreak.
This date is going to define the next chapter of your dating story.
Wear these magnificent sunglasses.
Put 'em on.
Oh, man.
You look like Brad Pitt on a t*nk.
In that movie Furry.
Yeah.
You ever see Furry?
Furry? Nah.
It's a bunch of dudes on a t*nk. They're, uh... and they're outnumbered and they sh**t a bunch of people.
Are they dressed in...?
You should check it out. Just look it up, Furry.
(chuckles) Google "Furry," nice, yeah.
Hey, don't screw up this date, it's important.
♪
(imitates sneeze)
(sniffles)
(coughing)
How is Genevieve dating Sam?
Is Los Angeles that small?
You guys even listening to me?
Yeah, we're listening.
(gibbers)
What-what did Queen Ta Ta say?
Well, the ball's tonight, and Queen Ta Ta's got nothing to wear, so she's got to find a dress.
What the hell is this show?
Both: Poppycock Palace.
It's amazing.
Winston, when did you get sick?
You were fine this morning.
Oh, yeah, I'm super sick.
(imitates sneeze)
(sighs) Genevieve just said, "Oh."
Oh's, like, the worst.
What should I do?
Don't do anything.
Just do nothing.
Nick: You're just gonna make it worse.
Leave it alone, Jess.
Oh, I know.
I could go talk to Sam.
(nose bl*wing)
I could ask him to put in a good word for me.
How long does it take to get over a breakup?
Two years? Two years is enough, right?
I swear to God, just leave it alone.
Schmidt: Let it lie.
Do nothing, Jess.
Four votes for leaving it alone.
That's what I'll do.
(all shouting)
I'll just do nothing.
Hi.
(chuckles)
I couldn't do nothing.
(groans)
(coughing)
(coughs)
We must find this Tee-Tee Wah Wah...
(sniffs loudly)
Humina humina humina humina...
(Nick groans)
(clears throat, Cece coughs)
(sniffling)
All these puppets do is sing about how they're friends.
I'm starting to not believe them.
(fanfare plays)
Shh!
This is the best part.
The Tee-Tee Wah Wah was in...
(drumroll plays)
It's in the damn Pee-Paw Playhouse!
Shh.
Spoiler alert, man.
The Pee-Paw Playhouse!
(laughing)
Every time.
I've been saying that for the past hour 'cause I saw you put it in there!
You know what?
I can't. I can not.
I'm not sick.
I've been faking it.
There you go, Poppycock Palace.
You've outed me!
You're choosing to be in here?
Why?
'Cause I'm freaking out about the date. Okay?
Why don't you want to go on this date?
Because I'm not over Aly.
And I know I should be moving on and this girl is okay, but she's not Aly.
(congested): No one is Aly.
What'd she say?
Wait.
Just hold.
Oh, please don't blow your nose.
You do it so disgustingly.
(bl*wing loudly)
Not done.
I don't need to know that bad what you said.
(Cece bl*wing nose loudly)
(continues bl*wing)
I'm beggin' you to stop. Just stop.
(sniffs wetly)
(coughs)
(clearly): No one is Aly.
Okay? You have to give other people a chance.
You deserve to be happy, Winston.
Just go on the date.
Or I could f*re up another episode and we could see where they hide the Tee-Tee Wah Wah this time.
I wonder where it would be.
(breathing roughly)
No, I'm-I'm gonna go on the date.
Yeah, I think I'll do that.
You guys are right.
Could you tell your future husband to let me out of this room, please?
I love that man, but he is not letting anyone out of this room.
Just being in here makes you fully contaminated.
(puppets chattering happily)
Uh, hey, I was hoping you could put in a good word for me.
I know you're mad...
No, I'm not mad, Jess.
I'm just, you know, bummed that you're at my house.
Obviously, I know I messed up our relationship and you probably think I'm a bad person, but if you could...
Jess!
What are you doing here?
At my lover's house?
Oh!
Hi! Hi.
Um, were you...
Making love?
Just finished.
He defused me like a b*mb.
That sounds nice.
Um...
Did you bake...
Sam brownies?
No. Chocolate's way too sexual.
(laughs)
This is just good, old-fashioned Kansas cornbread.
Jess...
No. (chuckles)
...my gut is telling me this isn't going to work out.
Please give me a chance to make this right.
Five minutes.
Mmm...
(high-pitched): Mmm...
Okay, good morning.
Yes, help yourself to a bagel.
Hmm.
They're all the same, Jan.
No need to put your hands on every one of them.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on the seventh day, God... he rested.
Yes, that's right.
God rested on the seventh day.
But the question remains: what did he rest on?
That's right.
He rested... on a chair.
(sneezes)
Oh...
Look underneath your butts.
You will find mankind's greatest invention.
(exhales)
Without chairs, do you know what we have?
Squat, both position and diddly kind.
Jess: Sam, you got rid of your sofa.
Boy, that thing really gave me a rash.
Five minutes, Jess.
Okay, look.
I know it's weird to hire your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, but I think it's another way in which we are linked.
You are the best candidate we've had in a long time.
Thank you.
As we all know, healing is talking.
Samuel, what do you think?
I would love to explore all of this with you, but I have a circumcision to perform.
Hopefully not your own.
Just kidding. I know you're circumcised.
Ha, ha. Yeah.
Well, not that I think about it, it just...
I mean, I'm definitely not picturing it right now.
I am picturing it.
Only 'cause we talked about it.
How long did you two share your journeys?
Couple months.
But at first it was just sex.
Mmm. Mmm.
Sam: I used sex as a wall around my heart.
Mmm.
Uh, Jess climbed that wall many, many times.
Mmm.
Uh, couldn't stop climbing it.
I think I was not the only climber to climb that wall.
Until we decided to become a one-wall, one-climber mountain.
And then you invited another climber to lick your toehold.
My roommate, Nick, kissed me.
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I exist only in the present.
All of that's behind me.
What... what about this Nick?
Is he sorry?
I think Nick's kind of still upset that Sam punched him in the throat.
What?
Sam... so tender and delicate...
You haven't met Nick.
He's just the most throat-punchable boy in all the world.
I don't care. I don't even...
Nick is a whatever, I don't even have to...
Sam, do you need this Nick to apologize for wounding you?
I do.
Jess: So, Nick...
I'm wondering if you could come in the other room with me and just, like, real quick, apologize to Sam for kissing me?
No.
Jess, I told you to leave it alone.
I didn't, though.
I made it worse.
Now the only way I'm gonna get that job is if Nick apologizes to Sam.
Jess, he h*t me. He's gonna h*t me again.
He's not gonna h*t you.
Please, it's my dream job.
(puppets chattering)
I'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.
I know it hurt a whole lot.
Not that much, but you did it, so...
Okay.
And I feel like you should apologize to me for kissing my girlfriend.
Yes, uh, right.
Cool.
(exhales) Well, that went so well.
I-I don't really feel like that was a genuine apology, and-and I'd really like one.
Yeah.
I mean... did you feel like it was genuine?
Actually, he didn't even apologize.
Cool beard, Sam.
What'd you just say about my beard, bro?
"Bro"?
Yeah, I just said "cool beard."
I think your beard looks really cool.
Talk about my beard one more time, bro.
Sam, "bro" is a beach term.
The beard is very fun.
Say "beard."
You want me to say the word that starts with a "B," ends with a "D"?
Yeah.
Say "beard" one more time, bro.
Say the word "beard," bro!
(quietly): Beard.
(grunts)
Oh! Oh!
Nick, are you dying?
'Cause it looks like you're dying!
Not dying.
Who are you?
I don't know what it is.
I just can't help it with this guy.
Why didn't you just h*t me in the nads like a normal person, Sam?
Well, I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't, don't go!
Nobody goes.
Jim Morrison.
That's who you look like.
We are solving this conflict in the mother-loving Feelings Farm.
Those sunglasses are amazing.
Well, they're made even more amazing by your reflection in them.
Wait, how are you seeing my reflection in them?
You got me. I'm not.
(both laugh)
I'm just running game.
Are you this smooth-talking in regular glasses?
No, I'm not that smooth-talking, no.
I'm not. I'm not gonna lie to you.
Jess: Honesty, I stole coffee from a bagel restaurant.
Um, I didn't know how the line worked.
Okay, now I've talked.
Uh, who wants to go next... Sam?
Sure, uh, Honesty, I honestly want Nick to apologize for kissing Jess.
I did apologize, Sam.
Real, real quick... you have to address Honesty directly.
You want me to talk to a chair?
(quietly): I don't want to.
Hey, you like soup?
Right? You like soup, right?
Of course I like soup.
All right, well, address the chair and I'll make you some soup.
Nick: No strings attached.
Well, except for the string of the chair.
All right.
Honesty, I'm, uh, sorry I ki...
You know what? I'm not.
I'm not sorry that I kissed your girlfriend.
'Cause, first of all, she wanted me to!
And it was fun.
It felt great.
And then we dated for a long time and that was fun.
You were out of the picture, not even in her thoughts.
It was a whole new thing. We just, we fell in love with each other, like crazy love... like, a lot of good memories, a lot of passion.
A lot of good sex.
Nick.
We once tried to sneak into the Kids' Choice Awards, and we got in and watched a bunch of kids get awards.
So, yeah.
Nick.
Topped...
Okay.
I have a fever of 103 and I'm talking to a chair and I'm not a great talk...
O-Okay.
Cool, cool.
Well, I think everything's good then.
Sam, I can feel you holding back.
If you can't be honest now in this strange place to that hideous chair, how can I trust you with my mind, my breasts and my precious yoni.
Sounds like it's full of yarn. (laughs)
Okay, fine. Honesty, all right, I... had a really hard time opening up to someone and then I met Jess and... and I thought we were...
We were great together.
And then Nick kissed her, and I-I went down kind of a weird path.
I gained 85 pounds.
And then I lost, like, 100.
I had no idea.
Poured almost all my money into silkworms.
They froze to death.
Now I'm doing yoga, meditation, and... I'm a vegan and I don't know.
What the hell have I become?
Look at these shoes, huh?
Look at these ridiculous shoes!
I like those shoes.
They're made from recycled shoes.
They are so dumb!
I don't know who I am!
I want to go back to who I was!
There he is.
The real Sam.
Wow!
(exclaiming)
What a breakthrough! Sam.
It is an honor to meet you.
I'm Genevieve.
And I am also dumping you.
Okay, that's great.
That's perfect, yeah.
As usual, I have had a terrible time in your horrible loft with all of you idiot people.
Sam, wait!
If you take your bike, will you relock mine?
Thank you.
Oh, Genevieve, I am so sorry.
Don't be, don't be.
I wanted a resolution and I got one.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to call my childhood phone number and scream at whoever picks up.
I'll see you Monday.
Wait, I got the job?
Of course you did.
This was one of the most profound Feelings Farm I have ever been a part of.
Radical, Jess, radical.
Uh, yeah, I have questions about where to park and stuff, but you know, I'll just, uh, I'll text you!
Ha!
(door closes)
What if the big letter comes back?
I can't believe it just took a high fever for me to like this show.
Not if it's silent!
Well, I hate it.
Why is the Crispy Castle bigger than Mount Tummy Tum?
It's dang gibberish.
How was your presentation?
(groans) Well, thank you for asking.
It was a disaster.
We can expect robust grow...
(snorts)
Are you holding in a sneeze?
(quietly): Mm-mm.
(quiet sneeze)
God, where did it even go?
(chuckles)
(sneezing)
Son of a bitch.
How did I get sick? I was so careful.
You did the best you could. I have no idea, man.
We're missing Poppycock.
You guys,
I hate that Sam's out there mad at me.
Because he's mad at you or because you still have feelings for him?
Because he's mad at me. If I could just...
All: Leave it alone. Leave it alone, Jess.
Right. You're right.
Wow, you shaved.
I mean, not "wow" like I like it.
I mean... I don't not like it.
What are you doing here? I, I don't want your cornbread.
It's not cornbread. It's, uh, it's brownies.
(laughs) Um...
Hey, I'm sorry we broke up.
And I think for me it was just... weird timing.
But I agree with you.
We were... great together.
Really great.
(both chuckle)
Get out of my life.
Big shift in tone there.
(sighs)
Eh, Nick'll eat 'em.
I need your advice on these wedding invites.
I like calligraphy option number two; it looks like a Bone Thugs album.
This looks like an ad for a bong company.
I like option one better.
Winston: You know what would be nice?
A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.
(chuckling)
What a magical wedding that would be.
You two are imbeciles.
Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.
Nick: Are you okay?
You look gray.
I didn't sleep.
I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.
I'm calling it D-Day.
Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions," and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.
That's incredibly offensive.
I know.
(door closes)
(shrieks)
Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?
Well, the girl they hired went missing and they need me to fill in!
Yeah! - What?
Oh!
Jess: Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!
That's right!
But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...
Cece, what are you talking about? Are you crazy?
You have to go to this.
I can do it all by my... by myself.
Are you okay?
(yawns)
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.
Okay, this is crazy. I'm just gonna stay home.
No, Cece, you have to go, please.
It's... it's...
Okay.
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
I can help with wedding stuff.
Just lighten the load a little bit.
Sometimes I think I was bred in a lab to help people.
You know what else they bred in the lab?
Pugs.
Thank you, Jess. That would be great.
Uh, no, Cece.
I don't have time to bring her up to speed.
Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.
She would... just sh**t off.
Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?
Jess is just gonna help.
She's not gonna take over.
Mmm...
Jess...
Mmm... mm... mm... mmm.
What's happening here?
Fine.
Who's excited?
There we go.
Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.
Wait, what?
You're right. Not your job.
I've done it before.
I mean, I didn't like it, but...
I did it.
Am I proud of it? No.
Did I do it? Yes.
Have I done it again since? No.
There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.
I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.
Gonna be fine.
There's chairs to be picked and...
(yawns)
...cakes to be tasted.
Schmidt? Are you asleep?
What?!
No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!
Just tons... too much to do today to sleep.
Jess... this is the most important thing that I own.
It is the wedding flash drive.
Everything that you need to know is on this.
It's color-coded.
Ooh, color-coded. Gimme.
Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.
Treat it with respect.
I will, and I just want to say I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
Schmidt: Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
Jess: This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
We want people to dance.
Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting, I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?
(Nick taps rhythmically on bar)
♪
Oh, finally.
Winston, where have you been?
I've been waiting an hour.
Work was crazy, okay?
I busted a poker room, which was a front for a cr*ck house, which was a front for a brothel.
It was a crime turducken.
This is the third time you've stood me up.
Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.
Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
Let's eat.
I can't. I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.
I mean...
You know, it's a... it's a bar in the middle of the day. Like, who's there?
Why are they there? Why do you need to be there?
'Cause it's my job.
It runs itself.
It's basically a big-ass fridge.
I'm a bartender and owner.
You know how many b*lls I have to juggle now?
Man, those are baby b*lls.
Hmm.
I'm a cop.
I spend my day working the city's b*lls.
Listen to yourself.
Those b*lls are big.
Listen to yourself.
I'm listening to myself, Nick.
Your b*lls, in comparison to my b*lls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle...
If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?
Unless, of course, you're scared.
Scared?
Scared.
I'm a cop.
I run a bar.
Welcome to the nerve center.
Over here, you've got accounts payable... bills, to the layperson... and over here is the schedule.
It's a numbers game, really.
Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery...
That's great, Nick.
Um, I'm a cop.
(laughs)
(knocking at door)
Come in!
Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?
Nick: Oh, great, everybody's here.
Why don't you ask my friend Winston?
He'll be handling all questions.
Yeah, that's easy.
Jess: All right.
I'm ready to taste cakes.
Okay, great.
This is gonna be fun.
I'm sorry, fun?
Baking scones with Winston is fun.
This is serious, Jess.
Mmm!
Soft and sweet.
What a relief it's not hard and salty.
How is the nose?
Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?
Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.
Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.
You picked nothing.
You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.
Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.
And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.
No. I'm stopping this.
You're stop... you're stopping what?

Great! It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.
How's Schmidt?
He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?
No, everything's fine.
I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.
Seriously? I can come back and help.
No!
It's fine.
It's just...
Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.
Do you know which one beverages would be?
I don't know. Blue?
You're a genius. I found it.
Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.
(laughing): I told him that I know it.
Oh.
Good luck.
Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.
I didn't do it!
I'm lying.
I obviously did it.
Don't worry.
We just put those there for people to break.
Really?
No, they were very expensive.
But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?
I'm Gavin.
Let's try this one.
Tempting, but my friends are getting married.
I'm kind of on a deadline.
And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.
(gasps)
Just taste it.
Okay, one glass.
Javier, you take the early shift on... Saturday.
Ugh.
Come on, listen, I got to do what I got to do, you know?
Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.
Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?
My husband has his fantasy baseball league.
He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.
That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.
All right, where do you want these?
Winston, where do we want these?
Where do we want...? Winston? No, dude.
I don't know you like that, man.
Put 'em where the beer goes.
Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.
Look, I don't like the early shift.
(disgruntled chattering)
Mercy?
Yes! Yes, yes, man. That's what I thought.
Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.
Guys, the schedule.
Oh, that's perfect. Thanks.
That works?
Back to work, everybody. Good stuff.
Winston: Listen, I get it.
This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.
But come on.
Let's be real.
It's still not harder than being a cop.
Then prove it.
Oh, I'll prove it.
Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.
I just got a text from Javier that said, "f*re extinguisher" question mark.
Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.
It's about to be a bumpy ride.
(chuckles)
(whispering): Uh, where... where are my sunglasses?
How the hell should I know?
I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.
And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.
Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.
Do what you got to do, man.
Is this how all partners talk to each other?
(laughing): Welcome to hell, Miller.
I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine...
...or spending time with a beautiful stranger...
(giggles)
...that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.
(chuckles) Or maybe we are.

Have you ever...?
Hmm?

I have too much manchego.
Happens to the best of us.

Yes.

Ah.
Jess, thank you.
You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.
Everything's under control. The bakery's sending over three cakes for you to try.
Okay.
And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.
Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?
I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.

No!
Ugh!

Hey, guys.
So, how did it go today?
Good.
We got a lot accomplished.
But, um... how do I say this? Um...
I made out with Schmidt's dad.
You did what?
She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.
You did what?
If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.
You need better labels.
Schmidt: Everything is perfectly clear.
Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.
The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.
Is he a good kisser?
Don't ask that, plea... And don't you answer it.

Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up: middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing? How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?
Because I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened, I can very well see that I'm not ready.
So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.
I'm sorry! He was feeding me cheese, and I...
I d... Ugh.
Please stop.
Please. So many details.
Please.
And-and God for... if you...
Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth, I'm gonna freak out!
Oh, thank God, Winston.
You're saving the city from a palm frond.
Los Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.
All right, it was a slow-ass day.
Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.
Did you say "yard"? Wow, who are you dating?
Tape measure, fine.
Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.
Dispatcher: 7-8-6-3.
Possible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.
Hell yes.
4-2-4 responding. Over.
Bar boy, get in.
Aly, let's lock and load.
Is your g*n not loaded?
You have to load your g*n, Winston.
(knocking on door)
Oh, no.
Schmidt, um, that's your dad.
Both: What?
What-what is my dad doing at our front door?
He thinks we're going on a date.
Why would he think that, Jess?
Because I said, "Let's go on a date."
I'll get rid of him. Go to your room and close the door.
Do not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.
(gasps)
Oh, that's disgusting.
Just go. Go.
Wait. Wait, wait.
I don't trust you.
♪
Hey, Gavin!
Nick: I know what this is.
I'm not falling for it.
You don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.
Stay here. Make yourself as small a target as possible.
I'll just be here napping out of boredom.
Winston (on radio): I see signs of forced entry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! I got movement!
I'm shaking in my boots!
Oh, yeah, right, he's ru... No!
Aly: Halt! Police!
(shouting)
(screaming)
Aah!
No! Get away! Get out!
(Taser buzzing, man screaming)
Okay, I get it!
Your job is way harder than mine!
Just make the bad man go away!
What?
Put the g*n down!
Yeah, my job is much harder!
(screams)
We're gonna make him go away!
(Nick shouting)
Can't stand to see Nick like this, you know.
At least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.
We all got to learn that lesson sometime.
Idiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.
He just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.
Oh.
(quiet laugh)
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, no, I... (stammers)
That's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!
You shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.
Come on, yeah.
No! No!
Hey, scoot over.
No, not in here! Not in here, no! No!
You have the right to remain silent.
No! No!
Gavin: What are you doing with a video camera on your head?
He is handsome.
Jess: That's a good question.
Oh, hey, look.
That's-that's good news for you, okay.
It's for work.
I still hate him.
They want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.
I'm an educator, so...
Oh, you told me.
I believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.
(groans) He's a bottom?
You want to give me the tour?
Or should we just cr*ck this open and make out?
What a line.
Who is this clown?
Bottle opener in here?
Well... oh.
Oh, actually, um, change of plans... I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.
No pressure.
It's just that I had a lot of fun today.
And, uh, I'd like to see you again.
(shouts)
What was that?
Oh.
g*n... the neighborhood's in a real slide.
This is my son's name.
7 billion people.
There's got to be some overlap.
We'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.
Wait a minute.
'Cause...
This is my son!
Oh, my God, do you know my son?
Kind of.
Does he live here?
Uh...
Is he here right now?
I didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.
And you didn't know I was his roommate.
And those are facts that will haunt us forever.
(chuckles)
But I can't let you go in there.
Because... he's not ready to see you.
And for once today, I...
Okay.
I want to respect his wishes.
I get it.
Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, I'll go.
Wait, wait.
What?
He's in there.
Shh.
She told him.
Son?
Babe, I think you should watch.
I don't...
Son.
You should watch.
I know you're mad. I get it.
Do you want me to take this off?
I didn't do a good job being your father.
You're in a zone. I'm just gonna sit tight.
And now you're getting married.
I get it.
I wouldn't have invited me, either.
I've missed a lot.
I'm sorry.
In my defense, I was stoned for most of the '90s.
And the 2000s.
Full disclosure... I was stoned this morning.
I like weed.
But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little, I'd love to have a drink with you.
And meet the man that you've become.
Come on.
Gavin.
That's okay... Gavin, not Dad.
That's just where I'm at right now.
Understood.
I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.
(groans) But in the past ten years, I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.
I really am sorry.
Gavin, this is my fiancée Cece.
She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.
It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.
I'm the terrible father.
Thank you.
Because whatever you did or didn't do, Schmidt turned out amazing.
All right.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.
I wasn't very good at being married.
But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.
For what it's worth, I like the second option.
Timeless.
I agree.
Good-bye.
Okay, wa... uh... (clears his throat)
Wait, uh...
Here, that's for you.
Let's see if you can show up this time.
I hope that you do.
Thank you.
There's no plus one, so don't even ask.
I'll be there.
(sighs)
Back to square one on the seating chart.
Oh!
Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.
God, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.
You know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!
It'd be a great idea.
Hello, Hollywood!
It's a big show!
Yeah, it's a h*t.
I want to apologize.
I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.
It's not. I'm just making schedules and buying beer.
Look, man. (chuckles)
The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.
You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.
Yes, that's a fact. We all know it.
But I got to say, man, this is first time I've seen you really care about your job.
(chuckles)
You're k*lling it.
It means a lot to me that you said that.
So thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
So, look, I got... I got us burgers.
Oh!
You know, I figured we're both too busy for steak.
(both laugh)
The tradition!
Nick, I need a drink.
It'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.
Schmidt, are you okay?
I mean, you look a little freaked...
Oh... oh-oh, Cece!
Cece's pregnant!
No.
Ow.
Jess made out with Schmidt's dad.
Oh, my God!
So many emotions.
♪ Got an old hound dog ♪
♪ Bobby Joe is his name ♪
♪ Got an old hound dog... ♪
Well, I mean, did you like it?
Don't answer that.
Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.
You're not answering the question.
No, she's not answering the question.
Sweetie, you don't have to say anything.
I liked it a little bit.
(guys groaning, clamoring)
Dude.
Okay, well, it's too small to be a cat hotel and it's too big to be pants.
So it's not mine.
Me neither. I pick up all my deliveries at the port.
The what? At the port?
Yeah.
What are you doing at the port?
Picking up my deliveries. Listen.
(short chuckle)
You drive all the way down to the port?
Yes.
Well, it's not mine. I only buy local.
Except, of course, for clothing and produce. Medication, water, seasoning, meat.
Maybe it's Cece's.
Isn't she packing up her apartment?
It's not Cece's.
She's packing right now, and Jess is going over there later to toast the place good-bye. 'Cause they're adorable.
Would you consider us adorable?
No, we're adult men.
We're cute.
Oh, hey!
My box is here.
Do you need help?
Oh...
Yeah, I was just gonna put it... Put it down right there.
Awesome.
Jess, is it me, or has your job become a poo poo festival?
No, it's fine. It's just the new principal, Becky Cavatappi.
She took over for Foster when he retired. I do all her work and she does all the working of her cleavage.
But the budget's your job, Becky.
Ah... Principal Cavatappi.
Like I always say: don't call me Becky unless you're riding me like a horse.
(laughs)
We work in a middle school.
Really.
This is the budget, or the next week of my life.
You know what they say... your life is just weeks and then you die.
Uh, Jess, are you sure you're okay?
Yeah.
I just got this for a little stress relief.
(laughs)
Oh, Schmidt, will you be a dear and text Cece and tell her I'm gonna be about, like, ten minutes late?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Aah!
(grunting, screaming)
Becky! Becky!
I hate you!
(screaming)
(knocking)
Hi!
Hello.
Look who I brought. The French.
Bonjour. Oh, it's Prosecco, it's Italian.
So grazie.
Oh, it's Polish Prosecco.
So that's on me for buying it at a gas station.
Long week of work ahead of me.
I'm looking forward to a fun night!
Okay, Jess, I should tell you before I...
I know I said I was done packing, but I'm not done, and the reason I'm not done is because I didn't do anything, and I have to get out before tomorrow, otherwise I lose my deposit.
Oh, Cece.
I know.
Cece, Cece, Cece.
Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece...
Hey, guys.
Hey, Winston.
I did it. I told Aly I need a new partner.
What? I thought you had a crush on her.
Yeah.
Well, exactly. You know, here's the problem.
She keeps talking about her boyfriend and his "ass that you want to open on Christmas."
What?
But it's fine.
You know, she took it better than I thought.
Screw you.
Here's your crap: lucky crystal, key chain fart marker, over a hundred yogurt tops, your flattened penny collection, a signed copy of a Paul Reiser biography, baby carrot thumb drive, a picture of you and Dave Coulier, loose Pez, my mom's cell number, a ticket stub from Urinetown.
When did you even see that?
Why? Why?
Oh, have you...
Have you tried 'em on?
Oh, and your Pure Mood CD.
This thing makes me want to swim into a boat motor.
(phone dings)
Oh... new partner's here.
Guys, as they say, when one chapter ends, a bridge appears, and then you cross that bridge and make lemonade out of a molehill.
Okay.
Hiya, partner. (laughs)
That's, uh, "hi" in karate. Hiya!
(both laughing)
That's cool.
You don't mind if we listen to some car jams, do you?
Well, man, let's just get right to track seven.
♪ Elations ♪
♪ Elation ♪
♪ Elations ♪
Elation.
♪ Elation, elation ♪
Elation.
(both laugh)
Oh!
I'm okay, it's fine, it's fine, yeah.
You okay, you good?
It's not gonna end well for these two.
I wouldn't trust him to watch a ball pit.
Hey, could I get a cream soda?
Dude, we both know what you're gonna do.
Don't. It's not cool.
What? We have a flasher.
You know what, maybe if we get drunk, then magically everything will just happen.
No, no.
No drinking until you've packed.
Look, I get that you're freaking out about moving, but we can do this. We need to make a keep pile and a toss pile, okay?
Keep or toss, keep or toss.
(phone dings)
Ugh.
Uh... Hi, Becky. Sorry, Principal Cavatappi.
Jess, remember that binder?
Yeah. Yup, I've got it right here.
I'll have it done by the end of the week.
Yeah, I mixed up the budget due date.
I took my contacts out 'cause they're ugly.
So I kind of can't read stuff.
I'll need it tomorrow.
Um... Uh, yeah, uh, but it's a week's worth of work.
You get it done or you're fired. (hangs up)
I have to do a week's worth of work in a night.
So we got to get through this quick.
Keep or toss, keep or toss.
Cece, that sweatshirt has a wine stain on it and an off-brand Looney Tunes character.
George Bunny? Who the hell is that?
You're right. Keep.
Toss!
No, keep, keep!
I'm calling the cops. There is a man pulling out his privates in our bar.
Oh, big whoop.
It used to be worse. It used to be more interactive.
What do mean, interactive?
Interactive.
You showed, too?
No, it was more like tennis, like... (snaps fingers)
Exit.
What's the second... (snaps fingers)
(snapping fingers)
Now it's just... (snaps fingers)
And I'm...
This is a problem. Wi-Winston.
New partner is working out great, man.
You know, we have a lot in common.
Both have cats, both partially blind... me, color, him, night.
Well, that sounds dangerous. Winston, listen to me.
We have some very serious police business here.
The bar has a flasher. A strange man is regularly showing Nick his funky soup bone.
I'm sure he doesn't even care.
I care about that greatly, Nick. I will be right there.
Whoa, partner.
Oh, oh, oh, my goodness. Hey, didn't see...
Seat's taken. the seat was taken there, Winston, I...
Yeah, I usually ride g*n because I get motion sickness as a decision-maker.
Yeah, well, I lose all hand strength with absolutely no warning. Just...
Damn it.
Mm... I'm sorry, I'll be fast. Mm...
Mm...
Mm...
Time's up. It's a toss.
No, that was actually an award.
Toss. Next.
Jessica...
Now, okay, look, that hat has a very important memory.
Hey.
I-I'm sorry I'm so bad at doggy-style.
Do you really want to remember Sir Miss-A-Lot?
This is all important stuff from my single life.
I think I need to go through the pile again.
You know what, you're right. Let's go through everything again.
Can you just come with me to the hallway and take a look at a pile I made out there?
Oh, yeah, okay.
I just really appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.
I know you got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, so it's...
(gasps)
I have to finish packing so I can work on the binder!
You made me do this! I'm shutting this tiny door!
Jessica, open the door!
You're a terrible packer!
Jessica, open the door!
Your favorite team is the Green Bay... Not Packers.
Let me in, okay? Because, you know, if I'm out here too long, I'm gonna run into...
Hey, neighbor, you dig turtles?
It's not a big deal.
I've been flashed by, like, seven or eight different people since college.
What?
You guys have been flashed?
No.
Never.
Everybody's been flashed countless times, right?
No.
Oh, it's just me who's been flashed about 300 times?
What?
You guys have never been flashed?
No.
Never.
Not even on, like, holidays?
Both: No!
Not even, like, after the Olympics?
Hey, guys, I still can't find the bathroom.
Where did you guys say it was again?
This place is like a maze.
Dunston, it's... it's one big room, buddy.
Never mind. I don't have to go anymore.
No, no, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.
You've had, like, two tubs of soda. You-you need to go.
Yeah, I do have to go.
It's right back there to the left.
Okay.
Yeah, right past the pop...
Someone call about a flasher?
Oh.
Just responding to a call about a flasher.
Oh, yes. Uh, there is no need.
Dunston and I have got this, so...
Oh, how is Dunston?
Huh? I hear he's blind and weird.
No. No, he's great.
Ah.
Dunston gets it done... ston.
And that's how we win.. ston!
(laughing) Oh.
(laughing)
How are you?
Really good.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, Hutch is one hell of a cop.
Hutch: I'm very strong.
Punch my stomach. Try.
I mean, I will.
It won't hurt.
(laughing): Okay.
It won't hurt.
(laughing): God.
Mm-hmm.
That's amazing.
Dunston. Bathroom.
Yeah?
Oh, that's right.
Dunston?
Ah.
Dunston?
No, I know.
(laughing)
You're in good hands.
I hope you're happy, too.
Great!
Great!
Great.
Great!
Somebody call the G8 Summit because I just felt the climate change.
I don't get that.
Hmm. Excuse me.
You know where the bathroom is?
It's not back here.
Right.
If you throw out one more thing, I am gonna hurl my body against the door!
Okay, fine, I am gonna do it.
I hope I don't hurt myself!
(crying): Ow!
You think I don't know those were hands?
That was a slap sound!
Yeah.
Okay, you're right, it's a slapping sound, but I-I think I overdid it and I really hurt my wrist.
It's, like, swelling.
I'm telling the truth, okay? It really hurts.
Just, can you please open the door?
And now my wrists are fine!
(screaming)
You snake! You rattlesnake!
Cece: Oh, my God, everything's gone.
Look, Cece, I know you're freaking out about leaving the apartment, but if you think of it like...
No. It's just, it's not just the apartment.
It's just... it's... it's all of it.
Everything is changing!
I'm not gonna have this place anymore, and I'm getting married.
(sighs)
Oh, my God, Jess, I'm getting married.
Are you having second thoughts?
No, no. I... I know I want to marry Schmidt more than anything in the world.
It's just... everything is gonna change, and I am scared.
Oh, honey.
Oh, my little breakfast link.
Okay, now, look, we don't have time for this.
Okay, you have to work on your binder.
(sighs)
Forget the binder.
Right now this is more important.
So you know what we're gonna do?
What?
We're gonna get into it!
I'm gonna take my pants off!
What? Why?
So, Nick, can you describe the suspect?
Mr. Miller, can you describe the suspect?
Uh, are you doing the interview, or...?
Oh, yeah, I'm usually the interview guy.
Oh, that's okay.
No, you can take it.
I'll take it, dude, if it's not a big deal.
Hey, well, it can be either...
No, I'm used to it, too, but you're used to it, so it's not a big deal for me.
Well, I mean, I'm used to it, but I'm open to new things.
Okay, yeah, but to the count of three.
Just-just-just please...
We're just gonna do it.
Both: One, two, three.
You do it.
I can... I'm gonna go.
He was average size, thin, wispy blond hair.
Oddly shaped, kind of came to a point.
Uh, what does that mean?
Top heavy.
A bit of a scar as if like from a hook or something.
Gross. Ugh. Uh, anything else?
I think that about does it. You want me to describe what his face and body looked like?
Yeah, that'd be... Wait.
Have you been describing his penis this whole time?
All right, that's it. I'm done.
I'm not even the one that called you guys.
Man!
And to be fair, I knew he was talking about a penis the whole time.
See?
That is way too real!
Aggressively detailed.
I had to guess on the testicles, 'cause he hadn't described 'em.
You know what it is? It's just that there's no turning back.
I mean, who am I when I leave this apartment?
"Mrs. Cece Schmidt?"
"Cece Schmidt" sounds like the mayor of an evil Swiss town.
(laughter) It does.
Oh, my God.
Did I tell you that Schmidt thinks that we should drop our last names and make up a new one?
He is currently, at the moment, leaning towards Zenith and Telluride.
I don't hate Telluride.
Getting married is just such a big leap.
You leap big all the time!
You moved here at 18 with nothing but a bunch of chokers.
Isn't it amazing?!
And it's mine.
Yeah, there's also a Kn*fe stuck in the wall.
Oh, look!
Someone left a spoon with some rock candy in it.
I wonder what flavor it is.
This is a way bigger leap.
(phone plays tune)
Ugh! Becky! You sloppy boob lizard!
Principal Cavatappi!
Oh, yeah, the binder. Yup, I've got it right...
...here.
(whispers): Where's the binder?
(gasps)
Um, yeah, uh, sorry. Uh...
Um, yeah, I've got it right here.
(whispering): Find it. Find it.
You packed it somewhere?!
Yeah, I can turn to page 13. Hold on.
Oh. Chuka.
Chuka, chuka, chuka.
Chuka.
(whispering): What is that?
That was a page-turning noise.
Chuka, chuka...
Um, yup, I see the graph.
Chuk, chuka, chuk, chuk!
Jess?
(sighs)
Do you remember Rosarito?!
We don't have much to go on, but I'll run your description.
Hopefully, Dunston wouldn't have spilled coffee all over the radio.
You know, he brews his own and drinks it out of a sandwich bag.
Schmidt: Winston, just call Aly and tell her that you want to be partners again.
Ugh. Look, guys, I...
I cannot.
I just cannot hear about Aly's boyfriend and his ass that don't quit, okay?
My ass don't quit! What about my ass?!
Winston, please call Aly.
Seriously, dude.
There he is.
Flasher: Hey, do you have any, uh...?
Freeze, buddy!
Oh, yeah, freeze!
Wait! Hey! (groans)
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
(grunting, thudding)
Yeah! Got him! (laughing)
All right! Dunston!
Oh, yes.
Yeah, man. I'm not normally the cuff guy, but I'll do it.
Yeah, me, either.
But I'll do it.
One size fits all, right?
Yeah, I guess it's...
Man, I just said, I'll be the cuff guy!
I'm not normally the cuff...
But, yeah, but if I'm not normally the...
Then if you're not... but I'm not normally.
Now, I'm doing...
Okay, okay, count of three. Count of three.
Who is the cuff guy? One.
All right. One.
Both: Two, three, four.
Five, six. See?
Five. Mm.
(overlapping chatter)
All right. Three.
Three.
Both: Two, one, zero, negative one. Damn it!
That...!
Winston, Dunston! Dunston!
Go! Hey!
(both grunt)
(sighs)
I got to say... he never comes in twice in a night.
I just hope he's okay.
I'm alarmed by how connected to this man you feel.
I just hope the best for him.
I am so d*ad.
If I don't find this binder, I'm gonna need a really good excuse. Oh, wait, Cece?
Mm.
Can you break my arm just a little bit?
No!
You're right. It's better if I do it myself.
Okay, you know what? Hey!
Hey, can I just throw something out there?
What if you quit?
I want to quit.
God, do I want to quit, but I can't! I can't!
You can quit. Because this Becky lady is making you miserable.
You were always someone who loved their job.

You remember the last time I was unemployed?
I ran out of things to knit.
I knit a condom.
Oh, the yarn-dom.
I pray this was never used.
Okay, remember earlier when you told me to leap?
You should leap.
I don't leap.
I take small planned steps, like an arthritic dog.
Really?
The last listing is a loft downtown.
Bad area.
The ad just says it's "sunsoaked and beige-y."
I don't know. They seem like three nice girls.
And now I am marrying one of those girls and totally freaking out about it.
You know who you need to talk to, right?
Yes. Definitely. Winston.
No.
What the hell?
What?
I'm gone for two months, and all of a sudden Winston's a bridesmaid? Never mind.
You need to call Schmidt.
No.
No, I can't call him and tell him that I'm scared.
I think that that's what getting married is.
Sharing all this, all the things you're afraid of, all the things that embarrass you, weak doggy-style guy.
You got to call Schmidt.
All right.

A voice call, Jess?
Let me guess, a family of ducks is crossing the street.
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's me. It's me. Um, so... okay, um, I love you but I am freaking out about getting married.
Cece, what? What's-what's going on? What's happening?
Well, I just... I don't... I don't...

Oh, no. Um, Jess, it's Becky. It's Becky.
What-what-what do you want me to do?
What do I do? What do I do?
Don't answer it. Don't answer it.
What? Who's Becky? What's a Becky? What's happening?
(phone chiming)
Don't answer it.
Do not answer it.
I'm gonna answer it.
What?
Hello! Hi. Uh, yeah, so, this is Cece Parikh, and you are treating my friend very badly.
What? Put Jess on.
No, no, no, no. You are done using my friend, okay?
So she... quits.
I what?
She what?
I what?
That's right!
Jess quits!
Nailed it!
Oh, my God, the binder. It's under the couch.
No, no, no. We handled it.
It's our perp.
Aly, I want you back. I...
I-I want you back.
Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?
I miss having you as my partner.
(scoffs) Do you want to tell me why you left?
'Cause you never did. And, honestly, Winston, that really sucked.
I left because you hurt my feelings when you kept talking about...
You kept talking about...
...how much you hate my music. You know?
This is about your Pure Moods CD?
That's it. That's all. It's the only reason why I left.
Okay. I mean, that thing makes me wish I was born without the ability to hear music, but if it means that much to you, I'll listen to it.
I-I-I appreciate that.
Look, you're the only partner I want.
You make me... laugh and whatever.
I don't know. I suck at compliments.
Yeah.
Partners?
Partners.
Shake it. Don't just hold it.
Yeah. Sorry.
(panting)
I think that was Dunston.
How did he not see us?
No idea.
Oh, yeah, he's night-blind.
Dunston!
It's done. Everything you asked for.
And, Principal Cavatappi, I'm very sorry for what my friend said. I...
Oh, I know. I would never let you quit anyway.
Can you come up with some thoughts on the science curriculum for the superintendant and sign my name?
Yeah.
Sure. Yes.
You know what? No!
I can't. (chuckles) No.
Nope. Um, because I quit.
I hope you have a minor career setback, learn from it, relocate, and ultimately have a very nice life, Becky.
(groans)
Mmm.
Do I want to know this story?
(chuckles) I hope so, because we're about to spend the rest of our lives together.
So you're gonna have to hear all my stories.
I want to spend the rest of my life hearing all your stories.
Until, of course, my hearing goes out and I get tinnitus. Do you know Dave Letterman has tinnitus?
Um...
About-about what I said on the phone...
I'm a little freaked out, too.
You are?
Yes.
And it has nothing to do with how much I love you.
Exactly.
Or how much I want to get married.
Exactly.
We'll be scared together.
And we'll be really happy together, too.
And we'll be really annoyed together, knowing that we're living with three other people and a cat.
Also, I think there's another cat.
Winston's being very evasive about it, but...
Mmm.
It's a foster cat.
I think it's helping him get over the whole Aly thing.
I don't care.
Well, I guess this is it.
I thought Jess would be here, but... you know, okay, end of an era.
Yeah.
(quietly): Have you ever been here before?
This is maybe my second time.
I nursed my pippy back to health here.
(chuckling): Yeah. I remember.
All right. I'm gonna give you a minute.
Okay.
(sighs)
Jess: Cece, Cece, Cece.
Do you want to do the honors or should I?
Hmm... Go for it.
(exhales)
Cece: Okay. One, two, three.
(chuckles) We did it!
(chuckles)
Jess: Oh, my God, there's hair on the end!
(gasps) Put it back! Put it back!
(door opens)
(sniffles)
Jess: Do you speak Russian?
Cece: Nope.
So your flight leaves tomorrow, so...
Yes, if we're ever gonna have sex, we gotta do it right now.
Now, what-what I was actually gonna say is do you want to print your boarding pass at the airport and use their ink instead of ours, but I like that yours ended with sex.
I said sex, but I meant meaningless sex.
Oh, I heard that. That's what I heard.
I heard meaningless sex.
I'm gonna be in my room.
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Time-wise. I'm not pitching positions.
Okay, great.
Holy...
Jess: Hi!
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.
Nobody was here when I got home, and the bed just looked so good, I went full Goldilocks, and you must be Reagan!
It's so good to meet you.
I put on my special underwear, because...
Nick!
Jess is back!
And I made a promise to myself when you left I'd be wearing these when you came back!
And I'm doing it.
Oh, my God! Thank you!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
All right, great, I'm gonna get out of here.
No, stay.
Nah! Nah!
Jess: The LA County Courthouse gift shop is straight up bull.
Can you believe I had to have these shirts made?
Yeah, I can believe that.
Where's Reagan? Probably putting on her shirt still.
Yeah, Reagan's not exactly the matching T type.
I-I feel like the moment has passed, don't you?
Yeah, I feel like it's so passed.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
That's the thing about moments, though.
They come and they go. They're fleeting.
That's a moment.
This is a moment.
Which makes me believe that although that one passed, maybe it...
It's also just, um, I'm leaving tomorrow.
Yeah.
So we don't want to make it complicated.
I mean, right now we're just roommates that made out a couple of times.
Well, I'm glad we talked this out.
Now your last day here won't be weird.
Nothing about this conversation makes me believe that that is true.
(snaps)
Yeah.
(sighs, scoffs)
(snaps)
Glad it's not gonna be weird.
Winston's weekly letters.
90% redacted, but still full of news.
"I'll leave you with my thoughts on the trial."
Big black line, big black line.
They redacted that stuff?
Big black line.
"LOL." Big black line.
"Gotta go, or I'll be late for my first dance class."
You know, actually the dance class has become more of a dance gathering.
You know what, maybe Schmidt and I will join you, because the wedding is almost here, and we have to work on our first dance.
Come. I mean, you know, two more referrals and I get to have my birthday party there.
Jess: Hey, Reagan.
Hello.
How was jury duty?
Jury duty was quite simply the tops.
Did I have a knack for it?
I suppose. Was I elected foreman?
Unanimously.
Am I going on the news tomorrow to explain the verdict to laymen non-jurors? (chuckles)
You know I am.
(chuckles) Nice!
And yet, I nearly threw it all away for love.
His name was Juror 237B, and we made the courthouse our hothouse.
Blood splatters, mucous seeps.
Jess: But nothing could happen between us, because, as every American knows, personal contact through the exchange of personal information between members of a sequestered jury is strictly forbidden.
But I promised myself, once the trial had ended, I would find him.
Extra! Extra!
"I'm gonna find that juror," vows Jessica Day!
Page two: It's w*r in the Pacific!
What?!
Nick: Schmidt...
I... Schmidt!
I need your help.
This is Reagan's last day.
I know it is, and you know what?
Whatever embarrassments or failures the rest of your life may hold, no one can ever take away what you've accomplished this week.
A goddess walked among us, and you went to first base with her.
Several times.
And I actually did a really good job kissing her.
But now I'm making it weird.
No.
Yeah, every time I open my mouth, I'm tarnishing my legacy a little bit.
But I have a plan. I'm gonna shut up.
Love it.
I'm not finished yet. There's more to my plan.
Do you need more?
Yes, I need more.
What more could there be? Just shut up.
I'm going to shut up until we say good-bye.
And then...
I'm gonna h*t her with a Goosebumps Walkaway.
I don't know who he is.
Is he an old-fashioned baseball player?
Goosebumps Walkaway is the line that they guy says to the girl in the movie that gives her goosebumps and then he walks away forever.
It's that line that...
That haunts her.
That consumes her.
That rings in her ear for all of eternity, granting you...
Both (whispering): Immortality.
You're damn right.
Immortality.
Come here. I want to say good-bye to you.
But it's not true.
So-so bad-bye, Reagan.
Bad... bye.
Okay, that was terrible.
Now, go write 20 more.
Learn them, inhabit them, practice them, and then throw those away.
Then write another 20 and submit them to me for my approval.
Can bad-bye be one of them?
No.
So 40 new ones.
Yeah.
That's too... that's excessive.
Reagan: So, what is your plan for finding this guy?
I'm typing words I know about him into a computer.
(typing)
Handsome plus Los Angeles plus 237B...
(sighs) ...is a d*ad end.
Not if you're looking for Japanese adult film star, Handsome Los Angeles.
Born in February of 1937?
Handsome, tell me your secrets.
Looks like you are figuring that out.
So I'm gonna go anywhere else.
(knocking on door)
Hey, Jess.
Hi.
Hey, Reagan.
Wow, you were in here.
I was, yeah.
Anybody else back there? (forced laughter)
If there was, I'd be terrified.
It's a small space.
So you and Jess are just talking.
I can only imagine what you guys are talking about.
Well...
I can't stand it for another second.
I have to address the 800-pound gorilla that's in this room.
It's elephant in the room.
800-pound gorilla is a different thing.
Okay, I guess I have to address the 800-pound elephant that's in the middle of the room.
It's just elephant. The 800 pounds, that goes with the gorilla thing.
800 pounds is not a very big elephant.
Jess! Reagan and I were romantic together.
Ooh.
I didn't know that.
Which means I've been romantic with both of you.
Cool.
And it's not just because you have brown hair and you've shared this room.
But because you're great, top-shelf ladies.
And I had the opportunity, and so I reached in the cookie jar, and I grabbed a chocolate chip and an oatmeal.
And I'm not saying who's who.
(sighs) I've gotten off-track.
Your worlds must be turned absolutely upside down.
This must be devastating, as it is to me.
We're all feeling emotions we couldn't even begin to discuss.
A lot of us are having bad anxiety, and our legs are feeling weird and tingly.
I think we're fine with it.
I think it's great.
I'm really glad I came in here and, uh, talked about this.
I feel like we've gotten a lot of... Great.
Mm-hmm.
Well...
Winston! (chuckles)
I didn't hear Winston.
He just screamed my name.
He needs help.
All right, I'm coming to save you.
That's the most embarrassed I've ever been for anyone not doing improv.
He's being so weird.
I gotta get out of here for the day.
Well, how would you like to drive around Los Angeles and look for a juror?
♪ Thank you for being Reagan ♪
♪ Travel to the car ♪
♪ And find a juror ♪
♪ Your heart is true, but you're not walking fast enough. ♪
You and Nick, tell me everything.
The power went out.
We went into the basement.
There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.
(squealing softly): Oh, my God.
And you like him.
No. No, I don't.
We just hooked up a few times.
Let's focus on you.
Here's a courtroom sketch.
Yep, there he is, 237B.
God, he can dress.
But we're gonna need more than that.
We need something distinctive, so did he have like a... he walked with a limp or he had a hook hand or a neck tattoo... anything?
No. (chuckles)
He was perfect.
We all were.
Except for the guy sitting next to him, 9C... ugh.
Reagan: What was wrong with him?
He never got why Bunt v. Che was a relevant precedent.
Also he wheezed... a lot.
Like the door of a haunted house.
He has asthma.
We can find that guy and see if he knows anything.
I used to peddle inhalers. What color was his?
Oh, uh... red.
Like the door of a haunted house!
Sorry. (laughs)
The only group excursion we took was to a haunted house.
By the way, if you like haunted houses but hate lines, January's a great time to go...
Dr. Foley?
Reagan Lucas.
I was just calling to ask you if you were still handing out samples of Ciliabreez?
Six months after the recall?
Oh, dang.
Jim?
Nothing more bad-ass than calling a doctor by his first name.
(shushing)
Sorry.
All I need from you is the name of a patient.
(Digital Underground's "The Humpty Dance" playing)
Schmidt: What is this, Winston?
Who are all these unusual people?
Where's the instructor?
It is a gathering, not a class.
I've told you that before.
Listen, it's fun.
That's not dancing. These people aren't dancing.
Dancing is about precision and domination and sweat.
Check out my ass. Check out my ass!
My butt is alive! (whoops)
(dancers clamoring)
Schmidt: We're not gonna learn our first dance here.
I'm gonna call my Beijing Opening Ceremonies contact.
He's fantastic.
No, no, no.
Look, I always imagined that our first dance would just be you and me having the time of our lives.
Very choreographed time of our lives.
No.
Having fun... that's how I want to start our lives together.
Can you please just try?
Please?
Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll try.
Just listen to the music.
Let it build.
Let it build.
Got to let it wash over you... Oh, there's the wave!
Let it wash over me on the three count?
Yes!
I think so.
It's happening. It's happening.
Well, just teach me the steps and I'd be happy to join in.
There are no steps.
What dance are you guys doing?
Because it is not Humpty's!
♪ This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name... ♪
This is his dance, y'all!
And Humpty Hump is his name!
During Cece's first wedding, Nick and I went into a duct to catch a badger that Winston had released.
Naturally.
It was crazy!
It was chaotic!
It was largely Nick's fault.
But then I realized he's the only person I'd ever go into a duct with.
Nick kind of sneaks up on you.
You think he's one thing... and then...
Yeah, Nick is great.
But I'm leaving and we're both cool about that so...
Oh, right, you're both totally cool about it.
I get Goosebumps Walka... Okay, okay, just think... okay.
Oh, wait, Reagan, before you go!
"Wherever the fridge of life takes you..."
You came in, I liked you, then you left!
What, what is that...?!
Stop thinking... that this is good-bye.
And start knowing it as... bye... bye.
Pretend I didn't do the "byes."
Reagan: So, Dr. Foley says our guy spends all of his time here.
With all this grass, no wonder his asthma is bad.
Jess: Oh, hey!
There he is!
Hey, 9C!
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no!
You do not run my life anymore. Good-bye!
Is that adult man afraid of you?
I take a bathroom break when I want to!
I cracked skulls as foreman.
Whoa, whoa.
Jess: "Men only"?!
It's 2016!
Clearly, I make the rules.
That's why my office is a hut.
Fine, we'll get a man.
So, Winston didn't answer.
Schmidt said, "They're desecrating the Time Warp.
Desecrating it!" And he hung up.
But I got a hold of Nick.
He said that he's super busy, which means he's naked and doodling.
But he said he'd make time for us, which is good.
Wait, sorry, so Nick is coming?
Yeah.
No, just call him and tell him not to come.
I thought you were cool.
I am cool.
You don't really seem cool.
It's just that when I see him, it's a, it's weird, Mm-hmm.
'cause I'm, I'm leaving and it's, it's complicated.
I do... I just, I don't really know how to...
Right.
God, I'm crazy about him!
Yes! I knew it!
I knew it.
Okay, yes.
That's enough. You're right.
You know what happens now.
I don't want to hug you.
You know what happens now!
I'm not hugging you.
Yeah, you are.
I'm not hugging you.
You know the other juror's name?
I think it was 237B.
What's that guy's name, yeah?
Oh, yeah, no.
I really, really can't. It's like...
Nah...
I like that guy, really?
What's the name of the juror?
No!
Calls hand sanitizer "ham sanitizer."
Tell me the name and I'll give you the hat!
Quit it! Quit it!
He calls DNA "D and A."
You want grass stain on this white hat?!
Please no.
But he kisses you like a coal miner greeting his wife.
After a day in the caves.
Did they go into caves?
237B is Gary Garcia!
Gary?
I'm not jumping this! Let's go!
You get back here!
Gary Garcia!
Schmidt: Look at her out there.
Treating the laws of music as mere suggestions of music.
Must be frightening to love a daredevil.
What happened to you?
Growing up a husky boy, I learned that I had no margin for error.
(Van McCoy's "The Hustle" playing)
Hey, fatty, it's called "The Hustle."
(laughter)
Schmidt: The slightest mistake meant ridicule, so I had to learn to do everything perfectly.
I learned to dance a dance the way that it was meant to be danced.
And until I learned to dance that dance perfectly, I would never dance that dance.
(shouts)
And then exactly 364 days later...
♪ Do The Hustle! ♪
♪ Do the Hustle... ♪
Boy: Sock it, man!
(audience clamoring)
Girl: Go!
(cheering)
Boy: Whoa!
No complaints here, fatty.
No complaints.
Let me ask you a question about this mean kid at the talent show... was he a child emperor?
No, he was as poor and trashy as they come.
So he had no power over you then or now.
Schmidt, you got to stop letting childish ridicule dictate your actions.
Oh, yeah, well, your-your smelly butt looks dumb in those pants.
(cell phone rings)
Hello?
Winston, I need you to run a name through the system.
That's a real thing, right?
Male officer: Yeah, nice vest!
(whistling)
Hey, look, Bishop altered his uniform again.
(laughter)
Poor guy.
It's a bloodbath.
He'll live. Come here, come here, come here.
Come here!
So, here's my plan.
I knock on Reagan's door and the moment before she says good-bye, I give her the Goosebumps Walkaway of your choosing, and then I walk away.
What direction?
What direction? Do I, uh...?
Do you go left, right or backwards?
Left, le... uh, left!
Nick.
Uh, right, right.
Backwards.
Left is a great choice.
'Cause that's what I started with.
Left is a great choice.
Thank you, man.
That's, that was my instinct, left.
And I would read that one.
That's 'cause this is a perfect one.
When are you gonna tell him how you feel?
Never. I'm still leaving.
What would be the point of telling him how I feel when nothing can possibly come from it?
Winston: So... there are 28 guys named Gary Garcia.
Great, I can do that.
That's not bad. - Really?
On that piece of paper.
931 in the system; still printing.
Are you sure that Gary didn't have something distinctive about him?
Just a smile big and wide, like the door of a haunted house.
Boy, was I wrong. Gary Garcia.
In my mind, he was Lawrence from Torrance.
In your wildest fantasies, he lives in Torrance?
Lawrence from Torrance, not Lawrence of Torrance.
He was born in Torrance, but now he lives in Brentwood.
Lawrence of Brentwood.
Kind of sounds like the sponsor at the end of a game show.
Yeah. "Pat Sajak's wardrobe furnished by Lawrence of Brentwood."
Yeah.
(giggles)
This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.
Even if nothing comes of it.
So you won't end up like me.
I never told Gary how I feel, and now I never can.
You can, and you should.
Don't let Miller become your Garcia.
Hi, Nick.
I want to say something to you before we say good-bye.
Shh...
Ew.
Sayonara, Sammy.
Sayonara.
What?
That's the shower.
(whispering): I know it is.
Hello and good morning.
Hello and good morning.
You okay?
It's not so bad if I don't think about the trial.
Trial, trial, trial, trial...
♪
Hello and good morning!
Today, more on that trial that's been captivating Los Angeles.
Joining us is the trial's foreman.
Thank you for being here, ma'am.
(distorted voice): Thank you for having me, Alan; I'm a big fan.
Alan: Also with us, via satellite, is another member of the jury.
No way it's him!
Winston: Whoa...
What are the odds?
Well, exactly one in 11, Nick.
Juror...
(distorted voice): Please, please, oh, my God, please.
...237B.
(distorted shriek)
Oh! - Oh! - Oh!
Alan: Welcome, sir.
(distorted voice): It's good to be with you, Alan.
Let's start...
Gary! Gary, it's me!
Gary!
Madam Foreman?
Is that you?
Yes! I'm Jess and I like you!
I'm Gary and I like you, too.
(laughing)
There it is!
(chuckling)
Man, they sound like Cookie Monster's parents.
How do I get in touch with you?
It's gargar...
It's G-A-R-G-A-R, like Gary with no "Y"s, twice, no spaces.
Someone get me a freakin' pen!
@historicbrentwood.info.
Oh, my God.
Wait! Did you say Brentwood?
Historicbrentwood.info.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
"J" as in Jack, "D" as in dog...
Should she be giving out her personal information on TV? I mean...
Jess: ...at...
...verdicts get appealed.
And K*llers go free.
Eh, hard to be k*lled over e-mail.
...and I live at 310 Traction Avenue, apartment 4D.
Easy to be k*lled in your home.
You know where to find me!
I need to see you now!
Okay, I know exactly where to go.
Stay tuned for your eight-day forecast with Crispin Saint Chang.
Jess did it right.
She said something real.
And I said "Sayonara, Sammy."
Who the hell is Sammy?
All right, man.
I'm gonna take off.
I gotta head to the station before my dance gathering.
You can't go to the station like that. They'll make fun of you.
When are you gonna stop worrying about what people say?
When I look into my suggestion box, it is full.
(laughs)
People have a lot to say about the way I live my life.
But there is only one comment card that I pay attention to.
And you know what that card says?
It says, "Great job.
Keep it up."
And you know who filled out that card?
Me.
You know how I know?
Because I recognize my motherfreakin' handwriting.
Now that's a Goosebumps Walkaway.
I can do this.
Right?
Yes, I can do this.
(phone buzzing)
Oh, what...
Hey, I was just about to call you.
Nick, look, there's something that I wish I would've said to you last night, but I didn't, so I'm gonna say it right now.
Sayonara, Sammy.
Those are such beautiful words.
I'm Sammy.
(clears throat)
Hello?
Reagan...
I'm gonna need some time to process everything you just said.
Yeah.
I really put myself out there.
Yeah.
I... Hey... in light of recent events, I think it's important that we have each other's current information.
I mean, I know I have your phone number because I just dialed it and I have your address because I lived there.
'Cause Jess said it on TV.
I've got a flight to catch.
Me, too.
Bye, Nick.
(laughs)
(sighs)
We did it.
(wry laugh)
Thank God.
Yeah.
Need some sleep.
Good night, buddy.
So, we're totally free to talk about anything.
Totally.
Yeah.
Like, any... thing.
Any thing at all.
Yes.
Gah! What are you doing here?
Well, it's been six weeks since we've talked and I was ready to talk.
You and Gary looked great on television.
(sighs) Well, that's how I want you to remember us: Blurry and talking like Zuul.
Well, then, mission accomplished?
(chuckles)
Hey, did Reagan say anything to you?
Yeah, she actually did.
She said, uh, "Sayonara, Sammy."
Does that mean anything?
No, but whatever it means will factor heavily into tonight's Nick-on-Nick time.
I don't want to know what Nick-on-Nick time is.
Masturbating.
Way more information than I wanted.
Everybody does it three or four times a day.
(laughing): Three or four times...
I'm talking about masturbating.
(laughing)
But never am I fully into it physically.
What? (giggling)
I missed you, kid.
Missed you, too.
God, your nose hairs have gone totally bananas.
I'm gonna get my scissors.
Schmidt: Cece,
I'd like to show you something that I have not been working on.

I will not.

Reporter: A record heat wave is melting Los Angeles, sparking chaos in stores across the Southland. Riot police have been summoned to several locations...
Oh, damn.
This heat is untenable.
It's like a Jewfro apocalypse in here.
I look like a '70s divorce attorney.
Nick: So we don't have A/C.
You guys are going to love this.
I invented something even better.
It's called the Ranch System.
The Ranch System for Cooling.
This is one of my best inventions.
Reagan's going to freak out when she sees it.
Check it out. We've got a combination of cool winds, a-a cool, chilly pond, you wear white jeans 'cause they don't absorb heat... that's actually science, I did research.
You know, science aside, man, you working those jeans. Oh, thanks for saying that, man.
I was insecure about the way they looked.
You k*lling it, man.
Hey, guys. How are you doing?
Well, everything here looks normal.
Welcome to The Ranch.
I don't know what that means.
Have a seat.
Reagan: Why would I do that?
Nick: It'll cool you right off. You'll love it.
Ooh. Is that chair supposed to be wet?
It is.
I...
Okay.
And away we... cool!
(laughing): Check it out!
Feels like somebody is learning to whistle very close to my face.
That's right, it does.
She said it feels like someone's whistling close to her face!
I never thought of that.
It's another plus.
No.
No, it's not.
But I have a better idea.
Why don't we all cool off... with the brand-new air conditioner that I bought?
Son of a...
Yes!
What?
What?
A/C!
Oh...
Damn.
Cece: Oh, it was so hot.
Oh, yeah, this is wet.
Cece: Having A/C.
That's sweat from my bottom.
♪
Schmidt: This is amazing.
Thank you, Reagan. Finally, we can stop living like people in a beer commercial before the beer shows up.
How did you pull this off?
It's not a big deal. That whole riot thing's really overblown.
Get the hell back!
(screams)
I will be putting the A/C in my room and everyone is welcome.
No, thank you. We're good.
I speak for all of us.
Reagan: Okay.
Well, we are observing gym rules, so make sure you wipe down anything you plan to sit on.
Whatever.
More breeze for us.
I'm gonna grab some old underpants and I'll put a pair in the freezer for each of you.
Trust me, I'm wearing frozen underwear right now, and I feel amazing.
(crackling)
So, I'm in good shape.
Cece?
Mmm.
I think maybe you should go... go hang out by the A/C.
Cece's got a big audition today to be a reporter.
She's been taking broadcasting classes.
Any way you slice it, that cafeteria pizza is a great deal.
You know, in fact, I'm getting a little hungry myself.
How about you, Carl?
I thought the next thing I was supposed to talk about was the rain.
It is, Carl.
I was just having a little banter.
Oh.
Um...
I... uh, I had a sandwich so... I'm full.
The audition's just for gas station TV, okay?
Nobody watches it.
Winston: Don't you dare downplay it.
I adore gas station television, I mean, myself, personally.
It is the intersection between information and also gas.
That's right. Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news... the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.
I just, I don't...
I-I don't think I'm gonna go to the audition.
'Cause it's... it's just so hot.
You know?
Okay.
Um...
Yeah, I mean, that's-that's cool.
Just... Look, I love you no matter what.
Go cool off.
All right.
All right.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What the hell was all that coddling?
Whoa.
What are you, a big-bosomed grandma?
Tough love! Make her go!
Don't tell me what to do!
I'm her fiancé, not some schnook off the street eating a peanut butter cookie.
It's my job to give her love and support.
That's how I get her to go to the audition.
As a cop, do you think I would get anyone to do anything if I were being kind and supportive?
Hell no!
Look, I have recently found my cop voice and I'll tell you this: it is very effective.
Is that what you've been practicing in the bathroom?
(loud): Everybody stop!
Make a left turn!
(high, wavering): You have the right to remain silent! You...
(elegant): Freeze! Nah.
(over-enunciating): Three hundred and three thousand thelonious thistles...
(climbing vocal scale): ♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs ♪
♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs. ♪
(deep): Freeze! (normal): Ooh, ooh.
(A la Arnold Schwarzenegger): Down on the ground, fugitive of the law.
♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs ♪
♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs.
Those were just my warmups.
My point is this, man.
You can't hug and kiss Cece into doing anything.
Your mind would melt if you knew what I've hugged and kissed Cece into doing.
Stay out of it, Winston.
(chuckles): My guys.
Hey, who needs Reagan's A/C, right?
Here.
Put some of my old underwear on your face. It feels great.
Oh, Nick... you're gonna make a great dad.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Hey! Who needs him, huh?
Yeah. We got each other.
Yeah.
We've been through worse.
Chicago!
Chicago!
(chuckles)
City of soup, you know?
Yes, sir.
So I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'll be back in a hot minute.
Or, as we say on a day like today...
... a minute.
(laughs) That's great, man.
That's chill, that's chill.
That's great. Thanks for taking my back today.
I'll see you in a sec.
All right, all right.
You and me, all day. You and me.
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
Look who it is! What happened?
The A/C fall over and squish Winston's cat?
Oh, my God, please don't tell me that happened. I would die.
I just came out here to tell you that it's actually really nice in there.
It's really nice right here, with my underpants on my face.
I think maybe you should stop pouting because I didn't like whatever this is.
Wait, what?
Why would I care if you, specifically, didn't like it?
Nick.
Reagan.
Nick, come on.
You want to go there?
I want to go where?
What are you talking about?
You wanted to impress me because you have a crush on me.
(laughs)
It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.
(laughing)
I need a laugh.
It's too hot not to laugh.
Lord knows it!
You do.
(laughing)
I don't have a crush on you.
You're very conceited.
And I don't mean to burst your bubble here, missy, but I am not out here because of my "so-called crush on you, "based on my actions that led you to believe I have a crush on you."
I am out here because I have never been more comfortable in my entire life.
Okay, you know what? Just go get!
Winston and I don't need you, sister.
Reagan: Oh, you mean Winston, like, this Winston?
What do you mean, like this...
Oh, Winston.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine, it's fine. Who needs you?
'Cause the hottest part of the day is already over.
It's 9:30 in the morning.
Then tell me this: why did I just eat lunch?
Why did I just eat lunch?
(thudding) Oh, damn. Good Samaritan just collapsed.
Oh!
And UPS guy to the rescue!
(thudding) And the UPS guy just collapsed.
Ah, lady stealing packages...
Ah...
(thudding) Oh! And the lady just collapsed.
Whoo. You know, I'm actually kind of getting chilly in here.
Look, guys.
I got this box of Jess's weird old ski clothes.
Oh!
Ooh...
Hello, 1989.
Winston: Check me out, I'm Picabo Street.
You know who that is, right?
I don't know who that is.
Real après-ski vibe.
I feel like I'm in Gstaad.
Gstaad's all about après-ski.
Well, it's nice in the summer, too.
Oh, have you been?
Have you?
Have you?
Have you been, is the real question.
Have-have you been to Gstaad?
Wh... I...
What does it matter? Just tell the truth.
Have you been there? Have you been there?
I'm sorry, have you?
No, I haven't been there.
Well... (laughs)
Should I be ashamed of that, or can we all just tell the truth about whether we've been to... "Shtaad."
Please. It's "Gstaad."
Shaad.
Shtaad.
No one in this room has been to Gstaad.
Yeah, one more fan.
Just a little closer.
Okay, that'll do it.
You guys are suckers in there! This is great!
Should we be worried about him?
Worried about Nick? Oh, no, this is just what he does.
Okay, but being exposed to the heat for that long is actually super-dangerous, so... maybe I should go reason with him.
(others laughing)
"Reason."
Please excuse our immediate but correct response.
(Nick grunts)
(grunts)
Oh, hey, hey.
Please just come into my room? It's right there.
It's not even hot in reality.
You're obviously suffering from heat exhaustion.
It's like a crisp Vermont November.
Apple cider, football weather.
Don't jump in a pile of leaves.
(chuckling): There might be a d*ad dog in there.
You're slurring your speech.
Soon you're gonna get dizzy, you're gonna get cramps.
Why do you care so much, Reagan?
Because you look like a dying man on a hospital show.
Oh, I know why.
Because you have a crush on me.
No.
(laughs) Yeah.
That's... that...
I... You're... you're a human being and I'm worried about... You have a crush on me.
No. That's why you're always thinking about me...
That has nothing to do with that.
... giving me my medicals, checking on me, giving me my medicals...
You said that twice. You are hallucinating.
No, Reagan, I'm "ha-truth-inating."
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna have to smoke you out.
Ooh-hoo! Smoke me out?
Turn 'em all on, great.
I love it hot.
Nick: Great, turn 'em up.
I got the sticks if you got the melons.
Marsh-melons.
Marshmallows.
Sorry.
♪
(imitates whooshing)
(laughing): Hey, Deborah.
Hey, Cece, now that... now that we're...
What?
Now that we're in the cool, have you rethought the audition?
Maybe you'll go now?
I mean, either way I love you, I just...
Um, no.
No, okay.
Mm-mm.
Okay, I still love you though.
(whispering): You leave me with no choice.
(whispering): What are you doing?
Ma'am! I'm gonna ask that you please remove your headphones now!
What?
Do you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?
Why are you talking so loud?
Do you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again?
Winston found his cop voice.
Oh...
Ma'am! Why are you avoiding an audition when you know damn well it's important to you?
Don't do this. Get back in your vehicle, immediately!
Ma'am, please answer the question.
Why are you avoiding an audition?
And do not say that you are not, because I know that you are, so tell me why!
Why?! Why?!
Why?!
Now, damn it, speak!
What if I'm not good enough?
It's my dream job, and what if I can't do it, okay?
What?
Cece, you're the most talented...
Sir, stand down!
Winston, you stand down.
Go play softball against the f*re department or whatever it is you do.
That's not till Wednesday.
Honey, I was terrified.
Don't worry... don't...
My hands are shaking. Block that out.
I'm freaking out. Yeah.
Block that out.
Schmidt: Okay, let's plan a trip.
Something to look forward to.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Mother freckles.
Winston's wild.
Cece: God, that was so scary.
It was so terrible.
It's okay.
(grunting)
Can you just admit that it's hot in here?
There's no way that you are not hot. I'm hot.
Why are you so worried about old Nicky pots and pans?
I don't have a crush on you.
You have a crush on me, it's obvious.
Why would I have a crush on you?
You are the most stubborn, annoying, frustrating person I have ever met in my entire life.
Why don't you tell that to the judge in your pants?
Verdict's in. You're guilty.
Where are you going?!
I'm shutting down your ranch.
Leave my ranch out of it!
Well, then I'm gonna do this, you idiot.
Whoa.
No, don't.
Leave it alone.
Reagan: Stop.
Reagan: No, you don't...
(beeping) (beeping)
What is going on?!
Damn! Damn!
Reagan, please, let...
Look, she's the one...
Wh... No, you're the one.
Schmidt: Now, get down to the basement and fix our power.
But the basement? There are so many rats.
She'll probably try to make out with me.
Please, I would rather make out with a rat.
Gross. Did you hear what she just said?
Stop! Go to the basement and stay there until the power is fixed!
Yes, sir.
(bell dinging)
Now, I have accidentally pressed all of the buttons, but you will stay on the elevator until you get to the basement!
And when you get to that basement... Aw, damn...
How is it even hotter down here Because the heat stays low, you dummy.
It's bad enough that we're down here, I can't explain science to you.
I hope that the Chicago Cubs win the World Series while you're in a coma.
That's one of the meanest things anybody has ever said to me.
We are visitors, let's act like it.
Hello, rats?
Hello?! (grunts)
I come to hurt ya.
Okay, for those who have not been scared off, I actually come in peace.
My name is Nick.
I've been down here a lot.
(high-pitched): Hello, Nicholas.
I'm Jeremiah.
Sorry.
Why would you... ?
It's funny.
Very clever.
You got really scared.
I'm not so scared, but don't ever do that again.
It's also a very good rat voice.
Thank you But it is a terrible rat name.
Jeremiah? That would never be the name of a rat.
It's name is, like, Sushi.
Or "Ma-cushi."
Now, follow me.
I want to leave one set of footprints.
That is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.
♪
Oh, hello, old friend.
Funny seeing you here.
Tick-tock.
Almost audition time.
Hey, Cece.
Huh?
You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?
You didn't mean that, right?
(laughing): Yeah, I did.
Newscasters are amazing.
But so are you.
Come on, Schmidt, okay?
I'm a bartender and a model.
(Southern accent): Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.
(quietly): Yes, do it, baby.
"Vehicle"? What vehicle?
The metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back.
Oh.
Don't explain yourself. Just go with it.
You are a brilliant, amazing woman, who is capable of anything.
Okay, maybe drop the Southern accent.
(New York accent): What, you got mozzarell in your ears?
You're, uh, get out of your own way, lady, huh?
Uh, tr-try, Law & Order... uh, Hargitay.
I've got a past and it affects my job.
And my relationships... I can't really do a Mariska.
What is happening here?
Cece, I know the audition is scary for you.
I would not be doing my job as the man who loves you if I let you walk away from this.
Don't blow it, Cece!
You are not walking away from this opportunity!
Okay...
I'm gonna need less talking out of you and more action, damn it!
(quietly): Wow.
Wait, no, Cece, I'm sorry.
Did I take it too far?
(door opens)
I took it too far, didn't I? Oh, God.
It's fine.
I have been down this road many a-times.
She's gonna come walking back through that door in three, two...
(chuckles)
Look, Schmidt, not for nothing, man, you got so many good characters inside of you.
(chuckles): Oh, my gosh.
Did you already bind the 120s?
Yeah, this should do it.
Do what? (scoffs) Cook you like barbecue chicken?
I traced it back. It's fine.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
It's not safe.
Can you admit that I might actually be right about something for once?
It's your own funeral; you win.
Great.
Don't do it!
Nick!
Fine, let's just say you are right.
Then at least let me do it, okay?
You don't have to do that.
I want to do it.
I mean, I don't, like, want to do it, obviously, but...
(stammers) What if I'm wrong?
If you think this is right, it's probably right.
You've been, you've been right about a lot of stuff today.
Like what? What else was I right about?
Just a lot of stuff. I don't want to talk about what you were actually right about at this moment. Okay, ready?
Uh...
If I get b*rned up and die this way, it would be such an embarrassing way to go.
But what would be nice about it is that I would technically have been right.
Here we go.
Heroes don't wear capes.
No, no, no...

Those sons of bitches did it.

Hey, great!
Really good.
That was really great.

Huge... rat.

(screaming) No! No! No!
This is my nightmare!
(people shouting indistinctly)
It's time.
(grunting)
How did I... ?
Did you carry me out like a firefighter?
No, you woke up right away.
And then you were like, "Ooh, I need some fresh air."
So we came outside, I bought you a muffin and then you passed out again.
Oh, yeah, I remember that muffin.
I feel like you had a pretty bad shock, so let's ask a few questions.
What day of the week is it?
That's not something I typically know.
I would guess Monday.
Okay.
Blackout.
ATM's are down.
Cash is king and batteries is queen.
What? Stop being so whimsical, Winston.
Cece still hasn't called me back.
(sighs)
I think I pushed her too far.
No, Schmidt, you did the right thing, man.
Look, people get mad at police officers because we tell them what they don't want to hear.
Yet, everyone loves police officer...
(horns honking)
(deep voice): Hey, it's a blackout, not the Rapture!
You yield!
All right!
(people shouting)
Hey, hey, hey, sir, sir!
Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Keep it moving!
Come on, right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, ma'am. Right this way, ma'am.
Right that way, ma'am. Sir, go, go, go!
We ain't got all day!
Winston: Sir!
Cece.
Right this way, ma'am. Right that way, ma'am.
Thank God you're here.
Look... I'm-I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, you should be. You really pissed me off.
I wrote something rude on your car.
It was that stupid cop voice.
I shouldn't have pushed you that hard.
No, you should've.
'Cause you were right.
I was chickening out.
So I went.
You did?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's amazing. How did it go?
Real bad. Yeah.
It went real bad?
Okay, well, you know what? about it, baby, I'm sure...
No, no, no, no. They just didn't...
It was, it was legitimately terrible but not because I'm not talented.
I went to the bar first so I was wasted and wearing shorts, which I won't do next time.
(both laugh)
Thank you for pushing me.
We need to do that kind of thing for each other.
Yes, please.
I agree, unless, of course, it's about me using face wash all over my body.
Ah, this again, really?
I don't care that it's expensive.
I know that you don't care.
I'm just gonna keep on doing it.
(music playing)
Oh, ice cream truck! Oh!
Right this way!
Here we go, sir. Here we go, sir.
Here we go, sir. All right, stop!
(music playing)
Ice cream, man, open up.
Where the ice cream at?
Can I buy you some ice cream?
First, uh, I just want to revisit that little moment in the basement where you were like, "Hey, Reagan, you've been right about a lot of stuff today."
Really?
I just want you to specifically tell me what You are out of control. I've been right about.
You're a grown man. I just think you should be able to say it.
(laughs) You dick.
I have a crush on you.
Hmm.
There it is.
I have a crush on you.
Isn't that better?
Now we can just put it behind us, move on, don't have to be weird.
No, I, obviously, I-I know it's not gonna be a problem, Reagan.
I don't have any illusion that you're gonna go for a guy like me.
I am a total mess. I understand that.
I mean, you're-you're beautiful, and-and you're smart, and you're-you're mean, but in a hot way.
And-and you have the-the mind of a electrician, which is so confusingly hot, because that is not, like, a sexy...

Well, that one diner has the best bacon.
Great bacon.
So I don't know.
Ugh, come on, guys. Please, God, we're entering minute 20 of the great brunch debate.
The other diner does have that special fruit cup.
Other diner. Fruit cup. Let's go.
However, when I think about it, huge crowd looking for that special fruit cup.
Smart.
So now we got to think line versus bacon.
Please, I am starving.
Make a decision. Oh, hi.
Do you guys want to join us? We are going for brunch in seven days.
Hybrid meals are for people who are too lazy to wake up for a proper breakfast.
Besides, we're looking for a wedding venue today.
Good luck with these two, because if they get really hungry, then all bets are off.
Curveball... maybe we roast a turkey.
Have either of you ever made a decision in your lives?
I make decisions all the time.
Disrespectful.
What's the last decision that you made?
First of all, you got to make a decision if you gonna make a decision.
You know what I mean?
(whistles, mimics expl*si*n)
Of course we make decisions. How do you think I'm wearing clothes right now?
I laid those out for you, Nick.
But I decided to let you.
This is your whole problem. Imagine how much better your life would be if you could just make a decision.
She's just mad because she had a bunch of dumb brunch ideas, you damn fool. (laughs)
(laughs)
Okay. Uh, well, what about this? I will sleep with one of you tonight if you can just decide who.
Are you... are you serious?
I mean, we're talking about a one-time thing and you can't get weird afterwards, but, yeah, I'm... down for, like, a fun half hour.
And you would be there?
Yes.
You would physically be there?
Yes.
Can it... be nice?
Well, that's on you. Let me know by 9:00.
What if we die before then?
There's not much I can do about that.
Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves. I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, am I right?
No, they don't. To the sausage factory.
What?
That's not what I meant.
Yeah. Let's go.
All right.
Thank you for the opportunity.
Good luck with your decision.
(door closes)
At what cost?
One sexual barracuda to another, I see what you're doing.
You're doing it for the story.
You want to see how deep the abyss goes.
You want to look that monster straight into the eye.
Maybe it's so bad that it's good.
But it's not good. It's b... it's bad.
Cece: Okay, honey, calm down.
She's not actually gonna do it.
No, I'm trying to teach them a lesson.
This isn't an '80s summer camp movie.
I'm not gonna sleep with somebody based on a bet.
I'm just... I was just kind of playing along with the whole thing just in case they were listening at the door.
Something about "summer camp moogie."
"Summer camp moogie."
No, no, no. I got nothing.
This isn't real, right?
It can't be. (laughs)
I mean...
I mean, it can't be.
Why would it be?
But on the off chance that it is, we need to take this extremely seriously.
You're absolutely right. Okay, okay. Well, what do you suggest?
(sputters) We do a gentlemen's debate.
A gentlemen's debate.
We calmly discuss who merits this opportunity and we come to a decision based off respect and politeness.
I agree. So... please proceed, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome, sir.
(chuckling)
Okay.
The gentleman knows that I have a monster crush on Reagan.
But because this is such a powerful argument in my favor, I politely take it off the table.
In that case, the gentleman politely... thanks you.
Hmm. The gentleman was sure that the other gentleman would not be such a jerk and let his friend's dreams come true.
Perhaps I'm not dealing with a gentleman at all.
Perhaps I'm dealing with a dingus.
Did you call me a dingus?
You're acting like a dingus.
How can I be a dingus when you're the damn dingus?
You're the dingus. You're the d...
You're-you're... you are...
Oh. Hey. - Hey.
Looking forward to sex later.
Well, that makesthree of...
That makes two of us.
Well, get ready for the skin circus, you little peanut.
Okay.
Whoa.
I was put in an awkward situation, and I reacted poorly.
Oh, whoa.
Everything rides on this decision.
You know, the venue is the axle of the wedding chariot.
I know that you have dreamed about this day since you were a little boy, but we are paying for this out of our own pocket, okay? So we cannot get carried away.
Okay.
Man: Yeah.

Man: Oh, I see...
Okay, this could work.
(instrument crackling)
(crackling continues)
Yeah... Huh?
(grunts)
Oh, my God. No.
Oh!
Some tea lights and flowers and this place could be nice.
It's like a Mumford & Sons music video, yeah?
Is there hay in here?
We're looking for the vacant warehouse for the wedding venue?
Vacant warehouse?
They're closing us down.
We're all getting fired.
Grab what you can!
Hey, you guys, kind of not cool.
You were supposed to text me before you got here. Okay.
Can everyone just take a seat, please?
Can you just stop t...

Hey, you...
Winston: Me owe you? You ditched me when we were supposed to run away from home together.
I built that raft for nothing!
We could do this all day, but I have actual feelings for her.
I thought you said feelings were off the table.
Well, I'm putting 'em back on the table.
I'm gonna settle this right here, right now.
Do it.

No.
...De La Garza.
Oh.
Huh, so look at me.
Look at me. Let it affect you.

and you Frenched her anyway.

You called dibs... and I screwed up.

It's you.
Oh, yes. Man, that girl better get ready for some kind, attentive lovemaking. Oh.
Hey, uh, have you guys seen my purple sweater?
Uh, no. And, by the way, we've made our decision.
Wow. That was fast. You have until 9:00.
We don't need it.
You'll be having Winston.
That's me. I'm Winston.
Great. Don't eat for two hours before. I'm really looking forward to it.
Bring your A-game, okay? Any previous injuries that I need to know about? Bring something to numb your mouth.
Oh. Look.
The sweater was in my hand the whole time.
You know, this woman requested my A-game.
My A-game. Maybe it's hopeless that I could even please this woman sexually. What am I thinking, Winston?
Just focus on yourself. Concentrate on yourself sexually, Winston.
No, Winston, that is not your way.
I just want to head off any discussion of what your way is.
I'm so sorry. I'm just feeling a little insecure about my body and the way it is connected to my face.
Bishop... (sighs) you have nothing to worry about.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay. What's my best feature?
Instant regret. Instant.
The second I said it, I was like...
If you had to pick.
Fine.
You have very nice...
That's our suspect. He's taking off!
What?
Okay.
(siren wailing)
Okay, I'll let you take point on this one, because I got to protect my duke for later.
Oh, you suck so much.
Has that park always been a pet cemetery or were just crazy people burying a dog there?
Well, I'm not even close to giving up.
Why don't we just pop in here?
Oh, really? We just "happened" upon The Lisbon, Schmidt?
Purely a coincidence that we... made it just on time for the appointment that I made a month ago.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
(classical music playing)
Ah. Mr. Schmidt.
May I offer you a beverage?
Perhaps an organic cucumber vodka spritzer?
Yes.
It is so beautiful. I feel like I'm inside Cate Blanchett.
We get that a lot.
I've got to say, I'm pretty impressed with how quickly you guys came to that decision.
Well, that's 'cause you don't know how mature we are.
You see, Winston had dibs on Cindy De La Garza since the fifth grade, I Frenched her in the eighth grade, so...
So about 20 years ago Winston had a three-year-old dib, he never acted on it, and now you're the bad guy?
(laughs): Oh, Reagan.
First of all, dibs can't be singular...
I mean, if anything, it's kind of a story about how indecisive Winston can be.
Well, no, it's a story about...
But you guys came to a decision... I'm proud of you.
Uh, can I... can I practice my presentation on you?
Sure. But I'm bored already.
Okay.
This stuff's really boring for me.
For everybody, I guess.
Hmm.
Hepatitis C can be a long... arduous experience.
But now discover Zilpoza from Wudai Pharmaceuticals.
FDA approval... pending double-blind study.
If you've had cirrhosis or kidney disease, Zilpoza... may not... be right...
(whispers): for... you.
(laughing)
You think I'm a 13-year-old boy?
I know what you're doing.
What am... what am I doing?
You're trying to lead me on, and I won't have it.
Case closed! You're having Winston!
Great, I'm having Winston.
Uh...
Mm.
(exhales)
It's so juvenile, what you're doing.
A dib is a dib.
Oh, God, if I keep looking at the ceiling, I'm gonna cry.
Damn it, we are getting sucked in... we have to leave immediately.
It's probably not even available.
There's no way, right? I mean...
You're right.
(chuckles) Philip.
Hmm? Quick question.
Look, we realize that you guys book up decades in advance, so please just let us know that you don't have any slots available.
Actually, you're in luck... Shia LaBeouf had to cancel his solitaire tournament, and we have one open slot, in April.
(quiet groan)
In April?
Mm-hmm.
All right, babe, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You need to breathe. We're just gonna enact the plan that we set up for when you see an ankle boot you really, really, really like, right?
What do we do? We walk away...
And if I dream about it in the middle of the night, then it's meant to be.
We're gonna walk away, Philip.
Thank you so much for all your help.
I should let you know, however, there is another interested party.
Benjamin (laughs): What? Schmittyballs?
B... B-Benjamin.
Okay.
Schmidt: You're engaged?
Hmm.
Mazel to you, sir.
Hey, Meems, this is the, uh, fat guy from school we used to make dance for chocolate.
Mimi: Oh.
Schmidt: In all fairness, uh, Benjamin would peg chocolate at my head while I was already dancing.
He what?
Benny-boo, I don't want to lose The Lisbon to these fat people.
The hell?
Don't worry, Schmidtstain can't afford The Lisbon.
Oh.
Unless, of course, they accept gift certificates from fat camp.
Benjamin, I still... I mean... I can...
Do they do that? I'm a different...
We'll have to ask somebody about that.
Okay, that is it!
We... are booking The Lisbon.
We are?
Go!
No.
I've never loved you more, Cece!
What were you gonna say?
What is that in reference to?
It's been silent for 30 minutes.
Earlier, you were gonna tell me what my best feature was, and then we got distracted.
Right. By crime.
I could tell you what yours is.
Oh, my God, please don't.
You have a lovely neck.
Really?
Not my knuckles or, like, the skin behind my ears?
Okay, do me. It's my turn.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, I need this.
Fine.
I will tell you, but then we drop it immediately and forever.
Drop.
You have kind eyes.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I have kind eyes.
I'll take that.
You know, I always thought I had snail eyes.
"Immediately and forever," remember?
I'll turn around.
Turn around.
I-I'll save my kind eyes for last.
Okay.
(phone buzzing)
Hello?
I'm reopening the Reagan decision.
Wait, what?
(quietly): I already took my supplements.
I know. I'm sorry. I'm telling her we've decided, and it was me.
Oh, no, you are not! I hear shaving.
Are you shaving?
No!
I know what that means.
(phone beeps) Hello? Hello, Nick?
(whispers): Damn.
Just go.
You mean it?
Thank you very much, Aly.
I am going to win this sex bet!
We want to get married at The Lisbon.
We want to book The Lisbon right now!
Uh, start by filling these forms out.
It'll be pleasure.
Yeah, no problem.
Cece: What's our routing number?
69364278.
Just gonna give Benjamin a little coffee... oh, I'm so sorry.
Hey, come on, she can't do that.
No, no, she did that. I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
The service is so gorgeous.
Really great.
You do realize we're not gonna decide this on who writes the fastest.
You know, here at The Lisbon, we celebrate grandeur, romance.
Oh, you are Schmidt out of luck, Schmidt.
Our wedding's gonna be sick romantic.
Our wedding's gonna be way romantic, bro.
Quiches so small you got to wear glasses.
Bitch, we're gonna have more white linen than a hospital in the Great w*r.
Yeah, we're gonna have so many fresh cut flowers that you're gonna have a real bee problem up in this bitch.
We're gonna have spanakopita so flaky, you're gonna get crumbs all over your mouth, like, what?
Our tables are gonna be names of cities that we've been to, like, what?
Our wedding is gonna be so... big... that the Giants will come to town and everyone gets a big spoon.
Philip, you-you want romance?
Let me tell you the story about how I knew that Mimi was the one for me.
The story is called "Lovestruck."
Schmidt: There's a title?
It was our fourth date, and we had just seen Toy Story 3 for the second time.
Maybe it's just us, but we love Pixar.
Benjamin: We're nerds.
(Mimi giggles)
I reach for Mimi's hand, and I was struck by lightning.
I mean, literally, I was struck Yeah. Zap. by a bolt of lightning, Philip, and I... I would've been k*lled if Mimi hadn't grounded me.
We met... crying (chuckles) over the same name at the Vietnam Memorial.
George...
Harrison...
Ford.
Wha...?
Who was our grandfather.
Schmidt: What? Making us cousins?
Making us cousins, because there is nothing more romantic than forbidden love.
Between family members? I mean, that's...
You're gonna double down with that?
Yes, I am.
He's writing "cousins" down.
Cece: That's a positive thing.
No, it's not.
Hey. What are you doing, man?
We had a decision.
The decision wasn't valid... your dib on Cindy was expired.
Okay, first of all dibs don't expire.
Also, dibs... not singular.
And how are you still shaving?
I'm doing full body, Winston.
I started from the bottom, now I'm here.
That's gross.
I've been doing sex prep all day.
I did a hundred girl push-ups.
I washed my feet until the water ran clear.
You can clean your feet all damn day... it don't matter, because I'm having sex with Reagan tonight.
The decision's been made.
Well, the decision's been changed... I'm having sex with Reagan.
That's not gonna happen.
It is gonna happen.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
No, don't...
Got it!
What were you going for?
The cologne.
I smell so pretty!
Give me... give me my col...
(grunts) No. No, no, no. No.
(spitting)
Oh, God! Aah!
(grunts) What are you doing!
I don't know, man!
You got frickin' cologne all over me.
I smell fantastic!
Oh, my God.
We got to turn the tables on Reagan, make her decide.
I don't see her going for it, man... the entire point was that we had to make a decision.
Well, then I guess we're gonna have to trick her, and I know how.
We'll up your fee by $10,000.
Ten thousand and one dollar!
Uh, Cece, we don't have $10,000. We barely have the one.
Ten thousand and two dollars!
It's not your turn to bid.
$15,000!
$15,000...
It's not... it's not... it's not worth it.
It's not worth it. Yeah, but it's your dream.
I... I know.
But I already have my dream.
It's marrying you.
It's all yours, Benjamin.
Yes! (giggles)
Benjamin: "I have my dream."
Dumb!
Mimi: They remind me of my stupid grandparents on their 60th anniversary.
(laughs) Old.
(murmuring)
Reagan.
Let me guess. You guys made a final decision?
Please. Sit.
That's probably the first time you've been right all day, but yes, we have made a decision.
Great.
Winston: Here's the deal, Reagan.
It's 2016, you're a lady.
Your decision is important to us.
Yes, we want you to decide which one of us is most attractive to you, and if that person is the same name that's on the piece of paper in this envelope, then sexual relations can commence.
Okay, well, the logic is bulletproof.
I just feel like if I'm gonna be making this decision, I need you guys to pitch yourselves.
For starters, I'm completely hairless, Okay. except for a straggler near one of my nipples, because I got scared while shaving.
In my fantasies, I'm a wild lover.
In real life, my sexual prowess has been described as "fine," "adequate."
"It'll get the job done."
That is both a lot and a little, but either way, a tough act to follow.
Winston, you're up.
Well, that's easy.
I've got kind eyes.
Nick: You don't have kind eyes.
You have snail eyes. Everybody knows that.
I've got kind eyes. Aly told me so.
Who's Aly?
Yeah, she's my partner at work. I complimented her first, told her she had a very nice neck, which she does.
But what I should have said was, "You got a really cool chin," or "You got some dope earlobes."
Honestly, everything about her is great.
And when I'm with her, I never really notice time.
It's probably because she is the best part of my day.
I should... I should have told her one of those things, as opposed to the neck thing, you know.
Then she told me I had kind eyes.
You like Aly.
Yes.
She's my partner.
Nick: Winston!
Come on, it's obvious. You like Aly.
I-I like her. I-I like Aly.
Oh, my goodness!
Why did I never think of that before?
Wow, my mouth is dry.
Anybody else's mouth dry?
What should I do? I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do. What should I do?
Winston, this is Cindy De La Garza all over again.
You need to make a decision.
I got to ask her out.
Good! Go!
Go ahead! Go! Good luck!
Listen, Reagan, I am so sorry, but obviously, we will not be making love tonight.
No. It's not fair.
I'm sorry.
I got to go.
Well, I guess that leaves just old Nick Miller.
Mm. Your room or my room?
Hmm?
Well, both rooms have a lot of interesting possibilities.
Mm-hmm.
That's a heck of a question.
Your, um...
Give me 15 minutes, and I'm gonna come back and tell you which room and why from my opinion, and then, you can give me yours, and we can discuss.
Just give me one second, and, uh, I'll be good to go.
I just need... two minutes tops.
Stay there.
(grunts)
Oh.
Oh! Aw, no!
Oh, that's a lot of blood.
Oh.
Damn.
(sighs)
Well, you're back, and you have an insane look in your eyes, so... congratulations?
No, I didn't do it.
I was, uh... You know, I thought about it.
Oh, I don't need to know.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah...
Would you like to go out after work, grab a drink with me?
Sure.
Sure. (laughs)
All right then. (laughs)
Oh. Uh, can my boyfriend come?
Your boyfriend? Yeah.
Yeah, sure! (clears throat)
How long have you guys been...?
Yeah, it's new.
It's new. It's new. It's...
He's an agent, actually, for... animal actors?
What am I gonna say? No.
He should stay at home and not exist, please.
(laughs) No, I won't say that.
Officer down... to meet your boyfriend.
I realize those were a poor choice of words for a station.
Reagan: Nick!
It's almost 9:00. Are we doing this or what?
What is that?
You look like you're in a Boca Raton street g*ng.
I didn't think you were actually gonna go through with it, and even if you were...
I made a decision.
I wouldn't want it like this.
So I decided to put on my I'm-not-having-sex tonight outfit, 'cause no one's gonna have sex with me in this outfit.
And now I'm gonna go out and have a drink.
Would you like to come?
Wow. Deciding Nick.
Let me change.
Nick: FYI... your I'm-not-having-sex-tonight outfit is leopard print and tight.
I don't know if you know that.
It's animal print, but it's not tight.
These are baggy, fuzzy PJs with a flap on the butt.
Exactly my point. You want to see what's in the envelope?
It's a blank sheet of paper.
You're so wrong.
Does that look like a blank sheet of paper?
Very clever.
Thanks, yeah. I thought of it when I was getting tickets to the World Series of Chili and had to prove that I was human.
Ooh, ooh.
We've got big news, you guys.
Champagne all around.
We're getting married in a...
Both: soon-to-be-abandoned warehouse!
Yeah. Champagne.
Oh, thank you.
And I'll even give you one.
Hey, guys, Aly is on her way to the bar.
(cheering)
With her boyfriend.
Oh, that's the worst.
Well, you know, everyone dies. Maybe he'll die.
I'm sorry, Winston.
Is there anything we can do to cheer you up?
Uh, no.
Anything that would make you feel better?
Anything?
Anything?
Well, if you insist, then.
You asked me what I wanted. This is all want.
All right, let's do it, let's do it. Let's just do it. Let's do it.
All: ♪ Motown ♪
♪ Philly's back again ♪
Now slower.
(slowly): ♪ With a little ♪
♪ East coast fling ♪
Winston: Slower...
Hey. Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
Mmm.
Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
Nick: That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
Disgusting.
You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
(door closes)
Winston: Oh, Reagan. What's up?
Hey. So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
Nick (mouth full): It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy. His name is...
His name is Stan.
Stan. S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
(sighs) That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
(Cece humming a tune)
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep. Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight; and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so...
(laughing): It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
Thanks, but no, thanks.
Nick: There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom! It's...
(door opens and closes)
Are you hiding toilet paper again?
I can't do this.
Did she h*t us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this? No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."
Here's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
You have a sexual to-do list?
Cece, don't ask.
Number one...
I regret it already.
Joan Allen.
Oh! Nick!
She's back in the kitchen! She's back in the kitchen!
Nick, we're making sex.
It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
What?
The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here. I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not? Oh, I forgot that you're a bear in pants.
Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall. She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, d*ad hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan! (laughs)
Ooh, what a coincidence. We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a m*rder!
I kind of prefer to run alone.
You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look. A bubbler.
Oh. Oh.
(slurping loudly)
Oh, that's so good! Mmm.
There's a Band-Aid in there.
Woman: Reagan?
Camilla. Oh, my God. Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."
Well, hello. What have we here?
Back on the stick, I see.
No, no, no.
No. No. I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
You know, we only got you for a month.
I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)
Call you later. I will.
Do that.
Call me, yes. Okay, great.
I'm going to. Okay.
Great.
Can't wait.
What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her. I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn. Let me do you.
Um... I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before. I don't know how.
I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
Wow.
Okay. I will help you break up with her.
Why? 'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No. Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute. What makes you think I've been dumped a lot?
Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good. You're pretty good.
Schmidt: How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits... are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown on the bottom.
I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head. I just didn't get it.
I don't know... I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate. It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?! He thinks that Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
I am a Democrat.
(laughing)
Ah, that's so funny. I love you.
Okay.
So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
(scoffs)
Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay. So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out. Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
It will be difficult.
Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
What? Get out of here.
No, it's true.
She-she told me.
Oh, she told you?
Yeah.
When?
Before.
(scoffs)
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
(bl*ws through lips)
"Reagan wears a wig."
"Told you before."
Yep.
"Because of lady stuff."
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
We failed.
Patience. I know my boy.
But, Schmidt...
I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying. Heard.
What are you doing?
What are you doing is the question. What are you doing?
Were you just smelling my hair?
No. I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too? Neither?
(door opens and closes)
It's a wig.
(yelling): Doesn't make sense!
What?
(chuckles)
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S...
I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either. Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up. Mmm.
Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap, Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...
I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay. So I'm Camilla. Break up with me.
(clears throat)
(scoffs) Camilla...
Yes, baby. I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together, and I just...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
What-what are you doing?
Oh, no. Are you breaking up with me? Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
I don't... I don't hate you. I don't hate you.
Oh, my God, you don't? Oh, my goodness. So you're not breaking up with me.
We're gonna have such a happy life together.
I-I...
I am. I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
Yo, this is mad crazy. I'm pregnant with your child.
Okay.
That isn't possible.
Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah. D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't... Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy. Here.
Here's $80.
Wow. Really?
You're just gonna bail?
Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
I don't want to hurt her.
Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't... know.
I just feel like it's over.
Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."
I have an idea.
Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What? No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
I been thinking...
Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right. How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal. Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure. I'll say so.
They're bald. Somebody hiding something?
Definitely.
Cece: Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.
♪ Ride it with my surfboard ♪
♪ Surfboard, surfboard ♪
♪ Bringin' on that wood, oh, baby, bringin' on that wood! ♪
We be all night.
We be all night.
Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?
'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.
She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.
Her room. That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.
That's why.
Not physically.
Uh, but as a person.
Like, um, it's not sexual. I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend. It's not sexual.
Her room!
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh!
Jackpot.
Ribbons! Oh, these are probably Jess's.
Nick, stop. You should not be in here.
I am learning so much about you, Reagan.
An Ohio State T-shirt.
Cash from Canada. It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange. You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion. An orange only has one layer.
Oh, you poor thing.
Okay, someone has to put everything back exactly like they found it.
Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this. Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
But I smelled it and I saw it.
We couldn't get you out of our room.
Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
Talk to her? Like a normal human being?
Yes, that's exactly what I want you to do.
Yes. Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
She's gonna be home soon.
Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"? "Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
Schmidt: Okay.
It's f... it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
Who has fake I.D.'s?
I'll tell you who.
Con men. Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out. Let me break this down for you.
Okay? She and her bastard son...
Or her nephew.
...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.
Pills. Doctor. Pharmacy. Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
(chuckles)
(door opens)
Reagan: Guys! Winston made me bring home dinner.
It's Reagan.
Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me? Clean up the floor!
Okay, yeah.
She is the one who has to explain herself.
Let her come in here.
You have gone full Nick, Cece.
What does that mean?
She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough. I'm very disappointed with you.
Put this down. I'll-I'll fold it.
I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
Hey, Reagan, come in here!
No, no, Reagan!
Don't come in here!
There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's...
What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
I'm her roommate.
Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great. Then I'm out. Blessings.
Okay, look, um, I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot of work to do emotionally.
Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
I don't have the... 47 times. And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
Getting bailed on.
Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all. Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah. Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it, and that's not a good idea.
Where is she?
How you... how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss. Is that correct?
That's true.
Yes. - Chicago.
So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay. All right, fine.
What about this, though... your son?
He looks just like you.
That is me.
Wait. What?
Oof. Rough haircut. Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
(clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?
Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day. Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about. I mean, I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
Excuse me?
Wait, you went through our rooms?
Oh, no.
How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha... you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved? Why is Cece not involved?
We want to be involved.
Oh, I'm involved.
So's Winston.
What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it. Reagan, how would you like to build a tree house with me?
No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No. I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is: Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
Not apparently. We are.
Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God. Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
Winston: Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
What are you doing here?
Cut the crap.
Why?
You sent him to dump me?
No. (scoffs) To dump you?
No. Why would I do that... Why would you do that?
Nick: What the hell, man?
Cece: That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
(quietly): Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh...
I don't want to... I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay. (clears throat)
The truth is...
...that I'm a criminal.
What?
I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me. I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life... I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster. We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just m*rder people.
My name is Nick. On the streets, they call me, uh...
Sharky.
Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I att*ck from beneath up.
Cece: It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
You're Japanese?
Very much so.
We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
Unnecessary backstory.
Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh... (clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.
Isn't that right, Sharky?
You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.
I am spinning out here, Moyel. You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
Schmidt knows about the tree house?
Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.
Stop it. This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look...
(exhales)
This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no...
Uh, it's right in my room. Right here, in the first door.
Right there.
Okay, thanks.
Winston: Oh, no, no.
Nick: That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
Schmidt: Yeah, it did.
Cece: Good job.
Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
Camilla: Freaking bitch! (crashing)
I hate you! I hate you so much!
Oh.
Yeah, it's the old "I left my sweater" trick.
(Camilla roaring)
Let me tell you something, folks, I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be a huge disaster.
I hate you so much!
But... thank you.
Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you... I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
(Camilla yells)
Anything to help.
It's kind of what we do.
It's how we roll.
(Camilla shrieks)
How do you think she's taking it?
What's with all these ribbons?!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
Camilla: You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
Cece: How about this one?
Are you ready to... soak Mama's beans?
It's working, right?
Okay, shh. I love you.
Yeah, I love you, too. I love you.
Let's not talk.
Okay.
(grunting)
Nick!
What?
You still can't eat in front of Reagan?
This has nothing to do with Reagan. I... I've just gotten used to eating in here. It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
What?

Can I come in? My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
Might as well.

Okay!
Hey.
Hey, what can I get you?
Can I get a beer and, uh, your number?
Actually, I'm...
This woman is engaged.
Her number belongs to God now.
Thank you.
My bad, I didn't see a ring.
I'm wo... I'm working on it.
That's something I'm working on.
Can't just put any ring on the hand of the most perfect woman in the world.
Now shoo.
Back to the mechanical shop or wherever it is you work.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Okay, so you're doing it again.
I'm doing what?
Ever since we got engaged, you've been acting insanely jealous.
Look, all bartenders get h*t on.
It's just part of the job.
Even Nick has groupies.
Are you free tonight?
I am, yeah.
Me, too!
(laughing): Oh, well, hey, well, I really hope you find something to do.
Winston: Nick is playing hard to get.
What was wrong with her?
I just wasn't feeling it.
What's "it"?
(scoffs) It's obvious.
It's, you know, it's...
(slurring): magic.
What?
Hmm?
Little bit of the magic thing, little bit of the...
"Man stick"?
I'm not saying "man stick."
It's what I heard.
I'm saying "magic."
Oh.
I don't know, I just... I want magic.
Is that so bad?
I want the music to swell.
I want the wind to blow.
I-I want the clouds to part.
Yeah.
Love! Magic!
Something exciting!
Why are you yelling?
Because I am embarrassed!
Don't be embarrassed, man, I want magic, too.
I want her to have a metal bra, and then I got a sword in my hand, and guess what, we both wearing skirts.
And we're riding on flying horses.
That's more like dork magic.
Okay, I don't want to upset you guys, but if you keep looking for magic, you're gonna be alone forever.
Did you just say you don't mean to upset us and then tell us we're gonna end up alone?
I actually don't care if I upset you.
Yeah, 'cause that's really upsetting.
You know, I got to... I got to say, I'm with Aly on this one, she's making sense, which is why she always plays "smart cop" when we play "Smart Cop/Dumb Cop."
Not a game we play.
I'm super worried you think we do, terrified.
I feel like we're playing it right now.
Great "dumb cop," great "smart cop."
You two need to get realistic.
You're not getting any younger, Nick.
Wrong.

How are you?
Oh, my God!
I'm so happy to see you.

Yeah.

But why do I feel so nervous?
You know, I'll tell you why you're nervous, my friend: it's because you're human.
Because you're...
Where the hell is my cherry?
If you are so jealous that you want everyone else to know that Cece is engaged, hey, here's an idea... why don't you get her a ring?
Because I'm afraid that whatever ring I get her isn't gonna be good enough.
Are you worried that the ring won't be good enough or that you won't be good enough?
Aren't you smart?
Yeah, well, of course I am... I'm in sales.
That's so funny. I'm in marketing.
I don't care.
Look.
Cece is definitely too good for you.
I know.
No, but seriously.
Like, she's way too good for you.
No, I know that.
Like, you should have never had a sh*t.
It doesn't make any sense.
No, trust me.
I said, like, I-I've known this the whole time.
I understand quantum physics more than I understand how you ended up with Cece.
Don't you understand that this is the problem, and I don't understand where I got to where I am right now?
You're right, I'm sorry.
And I'm all turned around.
I'm sorry, let me try and fix it.
You have two choices.
You can either spend the rest of your life terrified that somebody's gonna swoop in and steal Cece away or you can just love her, and thank the universe that she loves you back for some reason.
I know what I have to do.
Come on, we got to go find Cece.
You got to go find Cece.
You're in this now, too, baby.
You're responsible for my marriage.
Don't you ever call me "baby" again.
You want to make this about you, Reagan?
Your car, I'm driving.
My car, I'm driving.
Your car, I'm driving.
My car, I'm driving.
Your car, you're driving.
Exactly.
I said the wrong thing.
Jen just agreed to go out with me any time, any day, anywhere. How do you feel?
Totally fine, bordering on no feeling at all.
Ah, yes, the sweet spot.
She seems really angry. We... we should probably go.
Go!
Okay, I thought you were giving me a hug.
Oh, hey, Schmidt.
Be careful, okay?
There's a guy over there that brought me flowers.
I might realize that I'm in love with him and run away.
Does he come in here often?
An unfortunate start.
Look, I'm sorry for not being open with you.
The truth is-is I still can't believe that you're gonna marry me.
You spent the summer of 2003 at the MTV Beach House.
I spent that same summer watching Felicity on VHS and recording a fake radio show where I reviewed snacks.
I love you.
And I know you love me.
And so... (gasps) I give you my trust.
You've always had it.
And I don't feel the need to show the world that I own you by putting some gaudy gem on your hand.
I love you.
Ha-ha!
But you are getting me a real ring.
You're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.
We can go tomorrow.
We'll pick it out together. (laughs)
I did that.
Hey, nice job.
Thank you.
Let me get you a drink.
(groans)
Hold on, why don't you take it easy, smush pain, I got it.
♪ I'd like to rest my heavy head ♪
♪ Tonight on a bed ♪
♪ Of California stars ♪
♪ I'd like to lay my weary bones... ♪
(music stops)
♪ I'd love to feel your hand touching mine ♪
♪ Tell me why ♪
♪ I must keep working on ♪
♪ Yes, I'd give my life ♪
♪ To lay my head tonight on a bed... ♪
That is a perfect old-fashioned.
I know.
(chuckles)
Magic.
Magic! That was magic.
Okay, you guys saw magic.
I watched a hot girl pour herself a drink and then leave without paying.
Wait, she left?
She's a robber.
Nick has a crush on a robber.
How did she leave so fast?
She's amazing.
Guys, we got to go get her now.
Let's go.
Cece, let's go!
Ah, son of a...
Cece: Schmidt, I'm coming!
Schmidt: Let's get her! Come on! Let's go!
Uh, you coming?
Oh, I would.
But I have to stay here and eat pretzels.
Okay, I'll call you with an update.
No.
I'll text you with an update.
Don't.
Uh, ma'am, we're surprising her because we want her to move in with us.
See, earlier I said, "Get out!"
And she did. (Nick, Cece, Winston clamoring)
Which was an embarrassing mistake by me.
I don't speak English.
Oh, where are you from?
Um, outside of Connecticut.
Nick: This is a good idea.
Great idea.
This is a great idea.
I'm very excited. (shushing)
(music playing over headphones)
All: We want you to move in with us!
9.9 miles...
This just got creepy.
Why did we do this?
I personally did it because I thought the idea was cinematic.
Schmidt: How loud is her music?
Cece: We just have to get out of here quickly and quietly... we can, we can go out the window.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're not leaving without her. I got this.
Oh, no, no, no. What are you doing?
No, Nick.
I got it.
Nick, don't.
What are you doing?
I got it. Shh.
All: Nick.
(faint music playing)
Get off me!
Aw!
Ooh! Nick?
(Nick groaning)
What are you doing here?!
Thank you for the swift kick to the face.
Perhaps you want to live in our place.
(sighs) Genuinely didn't rhyme on purpose.
I think what he's trying to say is, we want you to come live with us.
Yeah. That's right.
I'm okay here.
I actually worked it out so that I get to pick out a lobster to eat at the end of every week.
It's a sick deal.
You know what's a sick deal?
Friendship. (all groan)
That's an unacceptable segue way.
I actually like being a loner.
It means fewer people break into my hotel room.
Okay, well, if you're such a loner, then why did you help me with Cece?
I don't know.
You could've left when I kicked you out.
You could've left when you caught me beasting that hunk of cheese.
That was disgusting.
But you stayed.
Now I'm not leaving.
And Cece's not leaving and Nick...
Well, Nick physically can't leave.
Winston's not leaving.
Hey, I'm Winston, by the way.
None of us are leaving until you agree to move in with us.
This is actually the kindest, creepiest thing that a group of people I've only known for four hours has ever done for me.
Ah, screw it.
I'm gonna move in!
Hey! Yes!
Okay, you're gonna hug, we're gonna hug? Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
It's happening.
Nick: I can't see what's going on, after being kicked in the head.
But I'm picturing a very happy scene.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, no!
(both shouting)
Help me, Reagan!
I don't know how to turn it off!
Oh, my... (both screaming)
The handle... it's too tight!
Reagan: Let's try it together.
Cece: It's so wet. I can't, I can't get a grip on it!
No, is this, is this hot?
Hmm. Yeah, that's hot.
Aah, yeah, that's hot!
Oh, God, it's too wet and slippery!
No, Reagan, just if you put your...
I'm gonna use my teeth!
Cece: Yeah!
Okay.
(sighs)
Why are you putting spoons in the laundry hamper?
I'm hiding our nice stuff.
See, my cousin Bobby and Carol are coming in town, and they're gonna ask me for money, so I'm...
I'm trying my hardest to look poor.
You are poor.
Technically, yes, but I'm also the richest Miller in the history of our family.
I mean, I own part of a bar, I have a savings account.
I don't fully understand how to use it, but I do have it.
Nick, you're doing great; you really been stepping it up lately. Calm down.
Thanks. The other day...
The other day, I was at a restaurant, and they asked if I wanted avocado, and... and I said, "Yeah."
And they said, "It's extra," and I go, "Shh. I know it's extra, but... but I want it."
Uh, Winston, you ready to go?
Born ready!
You know, believe it or not, you guys, I have never been wedding dress shopping before, so I didn't really know what to pack.
Are those whistles?
Yeah. These are whistles.
Oh, I even got a pocket fan so I can blow wind in your face, and your hair could be all like this.
Pocket fan.
Cece, I'm begging you, just cancel the appointment and reschedule it for when Jess comes back.
There is a six-month waiting list.
Do you not want us to get married in June?
Oh, no, I want to get married in August, so I can walk down the aisle covered in flies.
You're so concerned about these flies.
Please, go to the appointment.
Look, relax.
All right? Nick is the best man, Jess is the maid of honor, and myself personally, this is where I cut loose.
This is where you unleash the beast, all right?
Speaking of which, uh, Cece, did you bring your strapless bra, or should I get the booby tape? Booby tape.
Cece: Uh, no, Winston, this is just a ride.
It is just a ride, okay?
Hey, guys, C-Cece, my cousins are almost coming!
Cece, hide your jewelry! Winston, hide your jewelry!
All the jewelry!
Nick, this is insane.
Just tell your family that you can't give them any money.
Set some boundaries.
You're right.
Time for me to put my foot down.
Put it down.
I'm gonna say no.
Yes.
I'm gonna set boundaries.
No money for them.
(knocking)
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, how you doing?
I thought I smelled fish!
(chuckles): Oh, yeah, you smelled fish.
Look at you, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.
What, are you working out now, huh?
Yeah.
Tough guy. - Ow!
You doing yoga? You doing yoga, huh?
Yeah, I do... I've done, yeah. I don't do yoga.
Bobby: Oh! Look at this.
Exposed brick, dude? Really? Oh, come on.
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't build this.
You don't want to throw some carpet down over the hardwood?
Yeah, what's wrong with wallpaper?
I love wallpaper. I'd use...
Don't forget about who you are, man. Look, he's getting weird.
Yeah.
(bad Boston accent): Welcome to Los Angeles. Maybe we take a... a-a-a, you know, a "cah" down to the "hahbah" and check out The "Mahtian" on the big... on the big screen with Matt Damon in "Mahs."
Whose "cah" we taking?
(whispers): Stop, Schmidt.
Hey, we got you a little gift, yeah?
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah.
Oh, I left it outside in the hall.
Well, go get it, you moron.
Bobby: You're a moron, you moron.
I'm not the one who left it in the hallway.
Why didn't you bring it in if you saw it?
Carol: Because I didn't see it until now.
Yeah, 'cause you're a maniac, and you're controlling me all the time.
Oh, my God, I love you so much!
I love you, too, Peaches.
You're the best!
(sighs)
Regular Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, these two.
This is how it starts. There's three stages to a Miller asking for money: okay, it's compliments, it's ply with food, and then it's go in for the k*ll.
Schmidt: Be strong.
I'm trying to be strong.
Carol: Seems like there's a space theme. You guys like space?
Outer space? Yes.
Yeah.
Ah, you didn't have to do this.
I got it at the airport.
Yeah. Hey.
Schmidt: There it is.
It's popcorn.
Oh!
Yeah. Comes all fancy-like in its own trash can.
That's too much. That's too nice.
No, come on.
I love this kind of popcorn.
You're totally hooked up, brother.
'Cause you can mix and match.
That's right.
Easy. Nick's not hungry.
Oh, that's right.
Is he your life coach?
Thank you for the offer, but...
Nick, eat the popcorn.
He just ate.
I just ate. - Just one piece.
Nick, it's popcorn.
Do it. Do it. - I don't want it.
It's good for you. It's corn!
You're trying to give me popcorn so that I give you money!
It's not gonna happen! I'm not giving you money!
I'm setting boundaries!
Oh, Nicky, we don't want your money.
You don't?
No!
No, no.
We want your sperm.
What?
Yeah, we're trying to start a family, and Bob's army's down.
I need your troops to storm my beaches.
S-So no money?
No.
Just sperm?
Yep.
Don't tell anybody, all right?
Guys, this is excellent. I got a lot of that.
If I had a dollar for every sperm, my room would be covered in dollar bills.
Nick, a word, please. A word.
Carol: Right? Right?
Nick: Yeah. Yeah.
A word.
Yeah. Thanks for the popcorn, too.
One minute.
What's that guy, like, his manager?
Doesn't quite feel like the one, and it doesn't really feel like it's me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it is you.
It is beautiful.
It has an attachment for a leash.
No judgments.
Wink, wink, right? (laughs)
But it does.
Do you mind if I just take one minute to think about it?
Pass.
Pass. Pass. Pass.
Cece: Winston, I just asked you to drop me off.
Sir, what is your role here?
I am her friend.
My job is to protect her, so, please, cut the caca, and bring us some dresses with an A-line cut.
I may or may not have done an extensive amount of research on wedding dresses.
I never thought that I would say this, but I am really glad that you're here.
So you're gonna take his word over my word?
(whistle bl*ws)

Nick: Schmidt, this is great. They just want my sperm.
What about setting boundaries?
They're not just reaching into your wallet this time, Nick.
They're reaching into your skin wallet.
That's your scrotum.
I got it.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to veto this.
Yeah, well, you have no standing to veto.
It's my sperm.
You're my best friend in the whole entire world.
We've been through a lot together, so I just do feel like... your sperm are partly my sperm.
Mi leche es su leche.
No! No!
Nick, you've been doing so well lately.
Thank you.
Right on track with the plan.
My... What plan? What are you talking about?
I-I may have your entire life planned out on my computer.
I made a spreadsheet and everything.
I worked on it this morning.
You-You've got to be kidding me.
I don't... It's not...
"Nick's Life Plan"?
What is that?!
I'm just trying to keep you on track, Nick.
Look, we've always done everything together, and I'm just worried that we're gonna drift apart.
You know, I'm gonna get married and have kids, and you're gonna be wandering around the grocery store, holding a bottle of Scotch and an ear of corn.
Okay, you know what?
You know what I have to say to you, Schmidt? Boundaries.
You know, you and me.
Boundaries.
All right, let's do this.
We're having a baby!
Yes. - Yeah.
Carol: Oh, my God, my boobs are gonna get huge! (laughs)
Unbelievable!
They're gonna be like, "Get out of my way.
Here come my boobs."
Bobby and Carol: Yankees suck! Yankees suck! Yankees suck!
This really means a lot to me, man.
I'm sorry I couldn't do it myself.
Yeah, you know what I think it was?
One time, I got stung in the penis five different times by five different bees five days in a row.
What were you doing that your naked penis was exposed to bumblebees?
Why is he here?
You know, even though I don't approve of this, I would never, ever leave you in your time of need.
Schmidt, I don't want you here.
I told him I didn't want him here.
I can't be any more clear on that.
I botched it!
Botched it good! Three strikes, and you're out!
How do you botch it?
You do not have my blessing.
I don't need your blessing.
I don't want it. I don't care.
I don't even want you here.
Nurse: Mr. Miller, we're ready for you.
Thank you so much.
Here I go.
Nicky, give 'em hell, huh?
Yeah.
Get me a winner.
All right? You got it.
Carol: All right. - All right.
Go get 'em, Nicky.
We believe in you. Come on, make a smart one.
Here we go!
Bobby: Yeah!
Hey, Schmidt, can I have a...
So you do need my blessing!
I don't need you! Just please come back in here with me.
Thank you.
Never seen two guys so close like that, you know.
My dad and his... and his friend Joe were close like that.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you got in my head.
You got in my head.
Why'd you have to tell me about the plan, Schmidt?
Now I need to know what happens.
Why am I not supposed to have a baby this way?
As I saw it, your first child was to be born between you and a small Italian woman.
Like a Maria?
Yes, like a Maria.
Okay.
She makes meatballs and soup, and does laundry in a wooden bucket.
Yeah, she does.
You guys have a child.
It's a boy. I'm incredibly involved.
I give him the other half of a walkie-talkie just in case he ever has a question in the middle of the night.
(imitates static) Yes, I'm here.
He hides his broccoli in a planter during dinner.
I wink. I look the other way.
You mean e-broccoli.
What?
'Cause it's the future.
How far in the future are you planning on having a child?
Well, if we're talking about me meeting a woman, falling in love and having a kid?
A very, very, very, very long time.
So many "verys."
And let's face the facts.
My love life is a disaster.
Schmidt, this might be my only chance of having a kid.
Don't say that.
I'm saying it.
And if I can't have a kid with a woman, then maybe I'll have one with my cousin.
Horrifying wording for what actually is, well, a beautiful sentiment.
I-I want to do this.
I want to experience this.
You know, and I know I won't be able to raise him, and... and that's disappointing, but...
I'll still see the little guy at parties and such.
Say hi. He'll say hi.
Give him some fireworks to pop off, or... or e-fireworks.
Man, I'm just...
I'm getting excited just thinking about this.
Look, it's not how I originally planned it, but it's still another Nick Miller in the world, and I'll take that any way I can get it.
You have my blessing.
Well, it's embarrassing to admit, but... thanks, man, I kind of needed it.
Yeah, absolutely.
(laughs)
You should get out of here, man. I'm gonna go masturbate.
Okay.
(groaning)
We... really got after it there.
I am so happy I could help.
Like, I don't want to be... greedy about it, 'cause I know I've already put on the most perfect dress once today, and I should wait...
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I really want to put it on again.
You should put it on again.
I know!
Okay, I'm going to go try it on.
Okay, try it on again.
Okay.
Cece: Oh, no!
Oh, no.
What did we do?
What is this?
Oh, my God!
How drunk were we?
No.
No. Okay.
You know what, no, no, no, no.
This is, you know what, this is, this is good.
Everything's all right.
I mean, look, you got mirrors.
You know, no one's ever done that before.
I like it, you know. I like the...
Again, I can't talk enough about the mirrors.
Why is there a spot for batteries?
So the glass can light up.
We were really excited about that feature.
Yeah. You look like a prost*tute for wizards.
I look like a bullfighter in space.
I cannot get married in this dress.
Okay, so what do you need me to do?
Nothing. I don't need your help.
Okay. 'Cause I'm just...
I'm gonna do it by myself.
Well...
Yeah, well, no, I...
You washed?
Yeah, of course I washed.
Hey, why the... why the long faces?
Shouldn't we be celebrating here, guys?
Listen, we, uh, we talked to the doctor and, uh, turns out we can't afford the procedure.
Are you kidding me?
So I just masturbated for nothing?
Schmidt: You-you guys flew across the country.
You didn't think about any of this beforehand?
We did little to no research.
But we still want to have a family, you know.
Yeah.
We already fell in love with the little bastard.
Anyway, there is one other option we could explore.
What is it? Anything.
Nick...
I want you to have sex with my wife.
What?
Carol: Yeah, we don't just need your reindeer, we need Santa.
Schmidt: What? What?
Yeah, come down the chimney.
Feet first.
White Christmas.
Bring a sackful of gifts.
This is nuts. I can't do this.
This might be your only chance to have a kid.
Yeah, but then I have to have sex with my cousin.
I don't want to have... I don't want to have sex with my cousin.
It's not your cousin. It's your cousin's wife.
That's like letting a dog drink water out of your mouth.
You know, it's not great, but it's legal.
The point I'm trying to make is, is I think I'd like another Nick Miller in the world.
All right.
Can you imagine?
(chuckles)
Come on, man, what do you say?
(sighs)
Schmidt: I think the best thing to do here is to just look at this like a medical procedure.
Why is this guy in this conversation here?
Bobby, it's a losing battle. Just move past it.
And, Carol, look, I don't want this to feel, I-I don't know, romantic.
I don't want you getting confused.
There's a zero percent chance of that happening.
Yeah.
If you're suggesting that I can't be romantic, then you're out of your mind.
Schmidt: Yeah, excuse me, Nick is very romantic, okay?
He does romantic things for me all the time.
Schmidt, what are you talking about?
Just the other week, you were very romantic to me.
When I fell down in the parking lot and you picked me up?
(talking indistinctly)
(grunts)
Get up, dude!
How was that romantic?!
It was beautiful and it was kind.
You know, romance doesn't always have to be sexual, you idiot.
You're the idiot!
Don't. Don't.
Honestly, you want to do this right now?
Give me one sh*t at that big head, I'm gonna knock you out. (chuckles)
Dominated you physically. Admit it.
Yeah, defense.
Can we put something over the windows?
I want it to be pitch black in here, so I can't see...
I don't like the way you look at my body when you say that, Carol.
Well...
Schmidt: Okay, we got to keep it positive.
I agree.
I think what Nick is trying to say Uh-huh.
Is that he'd like to be completely naked.
Where are you getting this from?!
Objection, Your Honor! Strongly!
'Cause I will be wearing clothes!
Overruled. Yeah.
Overruled.
Yeah, stand down.
But I'll-I'll tell ya, I'm not wearing a condom! End of discussion.
(laughs)
Guys... such a clearly great joke.
Because obviously I can't wear, you know...
Oh.
We got to loosen the vibe a little.
Can we do something about this smell?
Oh, yeah.
(sniffs) It is a little rank, yeah.
There is an odor.
Yeah.
Well, I lost a glass of milk.
You lost a glass of milk? Was it full?
Yeah, it was to the top.
I could barely carry it.
Oh, that's outrageous!
Oh, God.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd just like to bring things down for a second here.
Bob, Carol, um, I originally bought this for Nick, but since he may never have someone to give it to, I'd like for you guys to have it.
Mm-mm.
No, dude, no.
We're Pats fan. We hate the Bears.
You don't like the onesie?
Pats are number onesie.
Where did we land on me being in the room?
Get out, Schmidt!
Get the hell out of here!
Look, I-I know that you have a "no return" policy, but you have to take this dress back, okay?
I look like a rich person in The Hunger Games.
Yeah, I know. (chuckles)
I was gonna stop you from buying it, but I didn't, so we're done here.
Wrong!
See, you may be done with her, but you're not done with the law.
Winston Bishop, LAPD.
You're a cop? The guy who was spinning around singing Patti LaBelle songs yesterday?
(high-pitched): ♪ I tidied up my point of view ♪
♪ I got a new attitude.
And you must be the one who was serving champagne without a liquor license.
We don't charge for it.
It's legal.
Uh, not if it's being served to a-a minor.
Oh.
Yeah. Oh, that's right.
I'm 17 years old. I'm a kid.
You're a 17-year-old police officer?
I'm a cop prodigy.
You see, my school is the streets.
But my other school is school.
'Cause-'cause I go to school.
Like a school-school, for learning.
You are so stupid.
No return policy is more important than the love that brings us here today, so...
This means a lot to her, so please help her out.
Well, that didn't work.
Look, Cece, I'm-I'm no good at this.
I'm no help. I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna take a backseat to the wedding.
No. Look... what you did in there made me realize how much you... really care about me.
I know that you're already one of Schmidt's groomsmen, um, but I was hoping you would maybe also consider being one of my bridesmaids.
You want me to be a bridesmaid?
If you don't want to, I...
Do you know who you're talking to?
Yes?
You're talking to Winnie the Bish!
Yeah.
I would love to be your bridesmaid!
Yes?
Yes!
Yes?
Yes!
Oh...
Girl, you are under arrest for taking my breath away!
(laughs)
What's with this parachute top?
It's good for movement, hard to stain.
I thought it was appropriate.
Okay. I don't know what you think we're about to do, but I'm keeping this very simple.
I want to keep it simple.
Uh-huh. Great.
Should we... should we just make love now, then?
"Make love"?
What, are we riding horses around on a beach topless?
No, thank you.
Just tip me over and pour me out!
Tip you over and pour you out?
Yeah. It's that children's rhyme that's also very sexual.
It is not sexual at all.
It is in this case.
Carol, I'm g... I'm gonna need you to be a little bit nicer to me, please.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I can't p...
Listen, I can't perform sexually if I don't feel a-at least a little desired.
Okay.
Could you give me any sort of a compliment? Anything.
We'll go and then we'll just... That will get me started.
I'll say something nice about you then and we can get into it.
(groans)
Just one compliment.
Nothing on the front. Can you turn around?
No. Keep turning.
No.
Stop. Ah!
Okay, I won't... Okay.
Please.
Um...
First thing that pops in your head.
(sighs)
Oh, Nicky, you're such a sexy boy.
(groans)
It felt crazy coming out of my mouth. Right?
Just some... just something simple.
Oh, my God.
Just take your pants off and get in bed.
Okay, yeah. All right!
Okay?
(breathing deeply)
Come on!
(sportscast playing over TV)
Any plans to go to the beach while you're in Los Angeles?
Carol: Bob! He's freaking out!
Oh.
Nick?
I'm not freaking out. I'm fine. Just my heart's b*ating really fast.
I feel a bit dizzy.
Carol: Are you freaking kidding me?
Just need one sec.
This is ridiculous!
All I did was take my shoes off.
Stand up and deliver!
What happened? What happened?
Is it over? Did you like it?
No! Look at him.
I just need one minute. I just need one minute.
Everything's cool! Deal's on. I just need one minute.
Get ahold of yourself, man!
Hey, I'm ovulating for two more hours. I need to get plowed!
You're dressed like you're gonna run a marathon!
Take off your windbreaker!
Schmidt, tell them to stop yelling at me!
No! You compose yourself and you make a miracle, or I will squeeze one out of you like a bottle of mustard!
What?!
Take your pants off!
There's not even a belt or a button!
Just pull 'em down!
Yeah, let's go with the miracle already!
Come on, man!
(all shouting)
No! Stop! Stop!
Just take your pants off!
Five minutes, and it's done.
I don't like this! I don't like this!
Take your pants off!
Do it! Do it, Nick!
Come on, man! Do it!
Take it out and do it!
Boundaries! I said I need boundaries!
Get out of my way!
I need boundaries!
Unbelievable.
Wow. So typical.
(sighs)
Oh, look at that.
There's the glass of milk.
Really is filled to the brim. It's like an infinity pool.
Wow, how the hell did he carry that thing?
Bobby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible.
No, no, no, no. It was a bad call.
Yeah, I guess it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.
No. I...
I just can't stomach my kid coming from a Bears fan, that's all.
There's nothing wrong with being a Bears fan.
That's all I'm gonna say to that.
There kind of is.
No, it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.
That's what's weird.
We're gonna ask Cousin Terry.
He's got no arm past his elbow, but it was an accident; it's not genetic.
It's a good call. He's very good-looking.
Uh, excuse me. So we're not having a baby?
Well, this is... this is just great.
If you can't tell, I am being sarcastic.
What's with that guy?
(sighs) He was really fat as a kid.
Now I get it.
Ah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
We need to have a talk about today.
I know. Boundaries.
No.
It's...
I want you to have something.
What's this for?
I want you to save that and give it back to me when I have my own kid.
What do you mean, you're gonna have your own kid?
When I have my own kid. Don't make a big deal of it.
I just... I don't... I don't hate your plan.
I kind of like it.
Things have been going pretty good for me lately, and I-I would like to meet my own Maria.
With-a the meatballs.
With-a the red sauce.
(laughs): With-a the red sauce.
I want to see that plan you got for me.
Well, come on, man.
It's a rough draft, but you should check it out.
What do we got here, chief?
"Nick has a boy. He calls him Gio."
We die on the same day in 2098?
You m*rder me and then k*ll yourself.
There's not a chance I make it to 2098.
Not a chance.
I don't want to see the 2050s.
Oddly enough, you won't.
See? I freeze you from 2050 to 2064.
That's why you're the genius. That's why you're the genius.
Thank you.
(chuckles)
Can you see her?
Jess?
Hey. Hey, guys. I pulled some strings.
I got her a note that says we're here.
You are amazing. I don't know why every wedding doesn't have a bridesman.
Ooh, I'm-a get so naked at that bachelorette party!
That's one reason.
(all cheering)
Cece and Nick: Jess!
Okay, Nick, the bag, the bag, the bag, the bag. Okay. Okay.
I got it, I got it. I got the bag. What do you mean, the bag?
Oh, come on! Just one peek!
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay. We good?
Yeah, we're good.
Okay.
(exhales)
Hey. Hey, hey, guys. She's writing something.
Wait for it. Oh...
What? What's happening?
Don't worry. Nothing.
I think she's writing something else.
Okay. All right. That's something.
What's going on?!
Nice.
_ - NICK: We miss you, too!
Cece: Aw, we miss you, too!
All right, I can't take it anymore!
Cece: No!
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, Jess can fix it.
Jess can fix it.
Schmidt? Schmidt?
Cece: Just... No, no.
Cover up. It's not gonna look like this.
I got him. I got him.
You got him? Okay.
Winston, I got him. It's fine.
See? Everything's fine!
This isn't romantic?
Nick: Come back soon!
Winston: I love you!
Opening statements today in the trial of celebrity chef Susanna Gabey, accused of k*lling her husband.
The special tonight: cold-blooded m*rder.
The jury is expected to be sequestered four weeks.
Ooh, look, that's her. (laughs)
Anchorman: In this high profile case, initial courtroom reports note an annoyingly inquisitive jury.
In otter news, an otter was born at the zoo today.
Oh!
Oh, dip.
I can't believe Jess is gonna be sequestered. for so long.
Who am I supposed to go to for lady advice now?
I mean, I'm having a real crisis with KC.
Nick: It's not a crisis.
She posted a photo of another dude; it's no big deal.
Yeah, but when I asked her about it, she said, "He's a work friend, Winston. Slow down."
I'm like, "Slow down? We've been dating for four months already. I've seen one of your breasts."
What was the situation where you only saw one of her breasts?
We were playing dinosaur.
Look, I just need Jess.
Winston, it's gonna be okay, because I can help.
I told Jess that I was gonna take care of her boys while she was away.
What, you don't think I can be supportive?
(phone chimes)
No...
Todd is in town.
Ploons?
Are you kidding me?
Went to college with this guy.
He's the worst guy on Planet Earth.
(dance music playing)
His grandfather invented the springs that go inside pens.
He's got, like, a billion dollars.
Once he paid apl.de.ap from The Black Eyed Peas to hang out with him, just so he could look cool.
How much are you guys gettin' paid for this?
Bunch of marijuana.
And these carrots.
(phone chimes)
Ugh.
I just got a text from him.
"Nick the Dick"... hate that...
"it's Hot Daddy T"... hate that...
"in La-La Land."... hate that...
"Excited to talk bachelor party with you. Vegass?"
He spelled "Vegas" with two S's.
He spelled it with two?
That's ass. That's Veg-ass.
You see what he did?
You see what he did?
It's so like Ploons to assume he's coming to the bachelors party.
He said Vegas?
You can't invite him, Schmidt.
On the other hand, you know, a bachelor party does cost a lot of money.
I'm your best man.
I got this bachelors party under control, buddy.
First of all, you're saying "bachelors party," which is wrong.
Okay, so where we going?
Where are we going?
Yeah.
For the party?
For the party, yeah.
We don't have to go anywhere.
You want to go somewhere, right?
Uh...
Nick: We're going someplace.
Someplace that is so much better than what Ploons could do.
Well, he'd go to Vegas, which... which sounds awesome.
We're going to Tokyo!
I mean, look at you. You're obsessed with Japanese culture, you wear the kimono, right?
I'm gonna take you where Ploons can never take you.
I'm taking you to Tokyo.
(choked up): This... this is pimp.
This is so pimp.
(crying): I just really need to know, um...
(clears throat)
I was gonna say, how are we paying for all of this?
Doesn't matter.
How does anybody pay for anything?
Winston: No, no, seriously, how are we paying for this?
Boom, boom, boom...
(imitates playing guitar)
Who cares?
Both: We're going to Tokyo!
(humming Super Mario Bros. underground levels music)
Is there a three-prong outlet in here somewhere?
(vocalizing)
God, I love echoes in bathrooms.
It's so good.
Hey, there's a stranger in the bathroom.
That's just Brandon.
Who the hell is Brandon?
Brandon's how we're paying for Tokyo, Schmidt.
You see, I put a thing online.
I'm renting out Jess's room while she's gone.
Oh...
I'm gonna rent out all the rooms.
Are you insane?
I don't think so, no.
Do you have any idea the amount of bodily fluids that people let loose onacation?
Brandon's a really good guy.
He's just here to finish his novel.
I appreciate the effort, I do, but we don't need to go to... we don't need to go to Tokyo.
Not for this. I'm not willing to turn our home into a public pool.
One: I understand your concern and I'll make note of it.
You're not even typing.
Two: I already bought the tickets and they're nonrefundable.
We need to come up with $9,000.
You don't need Jess's bowl of advice, Winston, all right?
I really do, CeCe.
I mean, look. She's cheating on me.
KC's cheating on me.
Hmm.
The same thing happened with Daisy.
Everything's all good, then all of a sudden, she's hiding a basketball player in the shower and I own a cat!
I'm in a cycle.
I'm in a bad woman cycle.
She posts a picture with a hot guy, you post a picture with a hot girl.
That-that's great. That's perfect advice, CeCe.
I know. Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
If only I knew a hot girl.
Hmm.
Ah...
Trust me, it'll work.
I've done the math, and if we rent out every room for a month, we'll have enough money, we won't need Todd.
The hospitality industry is fast-paced and it's detail-oriented.
And you have the focus of a coked-up Italian on a summer day.
I'm very focused.
You're not even looking at me right now.
I thought I saw something shiny.
Um...
But no, it was nothing.
How do you drive your car and not h*t people?
I have never been more focused in my...
It was a spoon.
I saw the... it was just a spoon.
Nick, let's just call Todd.
Let's bite the b*llet...
No, Schmidt, we don't need his money. Look at me.
(sighs) Okay...
Schmidty, I'm your best man.
And I may not be a rich man.
The only thing my parents invented was a wand to push the buttons on the microwave from the table, so you don't have to get up.
You mean like a stick?
My point is, it's my job to give you the bachelors party of your dreams.
And I intend on doing that.
Why don't you close your eyes for me?
What do you see when you see your dream bachelors party?
Sushi.
(chuckles) A lot of it.
Sake.
Honor.
And no Todd, right?
Look around. Is Todd there?
'Cause we don't need him.
We can do this.
I want you to look at me and tell me you believe we can do this.
Do you believe, Schmidty?
Do you believe?
Schmidty? Do you believe?
I believe...!
Do you believe?
I believe!
Yeah!
I'm gonna eat sushi off my own ass!
Why you using tongs?
We don't use tongs at home.
Don't forget to write your reviews and it'd be nice if you mentioned Nick.
So you're just full-bl*wn running a hotel now?
Man: All right, let's go.
It's a boutique hotel, yes.
We are offering a premiere experience in a competitive marketplace.
Okay? And the reviews are everything.
So grab a vacuum...
I'm gonna go take my 15.
It's not time for a break. You just started working.
It takes a staff to run...
There's no work ethic there... how do you work...?
(phone ringing)
Look at that.
KC took the bait.
I gotta take my 15.
Uh, hello? What it do, Jacques?
Everybody's taking their 15.
Got no staff.
Kumiko, how are you?
Hey, Kumiko.
Kumiko, you're from Japan, yes?
Well, you know, Nick and I are going to Japan. Any tips?
Yes?
Cleaning.
She's talking about the shower.
Oh!
Schmidt: Yes.
Let me help you with that shower.
Okay, you just... stay there for a second, cowboy.
Please.
We're running a business here.
We're running a hotel.
No sex with the guests.
You gotta focus, here.
Hey, you know this: I'm a businessman first.
Yes.
I'm a sex guy second.
Okay?
Stay focused, man.
No sex, no Todd.
No Todd.
Tokyo!
Tokyo.
♪ ♪
Oh. Thought you were Nick.
Well, uh, KC saw the picture.
Oh, great, you're welcome.
And she instantly broke up with me.
(softly): Oh.
Um...
I'm sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
(loud continuous sob)
(sob winds down)
(sob resumes)
This is your fault.
I need Jess.
No, you know what, no, you don't need, you don't need Jess.
'Cause I'm here, and I've got this.
So what can I do that's Jess-like?
You want some, you want some tea?
You want, like, cupcakes or a cute song?
I need Jess.
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna do the tea thing.
How about I do the tea thing for you, and then I'll, it'll soothe you, okay?
So, how do I, how do you make tea?
How do you make tea?!
I'll fig... I'll figure it out. I'll just get some water and I'll ta...
Yeah.
You know, it's...
Water and leaves!
Water and leaves!
Water and leaves.
So, this is hot, and this is cold.
Yes. (chuckles)
Wet down there.
Wet down there.
Oh, I don't need to know that, Kumiko.
That is, that is not my business.
Wet down there!
Oh, you mean down there! Yeah...
Yes!
That's really...
(groans)
Yes, that's, yeah, that's actually, yeah. Let me get in the drain.
Sorry about that glass.
(chuckles)
I was in the zone writing, and I just...
It's just a glass, right?
Yeah.
As a reminder, there's some plastic disposable cups, literally, right there, so there's no need to rummage through the cabinets with your travelers' hands.
Okay.
Okay.
But how's the novel coming?
Oh, I mean, I'm stuck on a love scene.
Ain't that always the case?
Couldn't imagine.
Listen to this.
What?
"As his electric car powered down, the first thing he saw was..."
No, look at me.
Look at me.
Do I have to?
Yeah.
"...first thing he saw was her virgin breasts glowing in the Alabama moonlight. She said, 'Which one do you want to see? The left or the right?' And I said, 'Both.' She said, 'No, pick one.' So I said, 'Left.' She finally showed him, and it was as big as a Cadillac. She grabbed him by the potatoes and led him up the stairs. So many stairs. Left, right, left, right, left, right.
He grabbed the bannister and then let go."
Oh, that's erotic stuff.
Oh, thank you.
You're very welcome.
That's very sexy stuff you're writing.
Thanks.
The sexiest, really.
Where the hell have you been?
"The parakeet was still in the room, but it turned out to be a welcome addition to the games at hand."
Lose that one?
I don't even get that one. I didn't get that one.
Let go of it. I have no emotional connection.
You're cracking; take your 15.
I'm not cracking.
Oh!
Nuts.
You weak-handed moron!
Hey!
Who also is our cherished guest here.
It's just the weight of it.
The liquid and the balance of it... I'm so sorry.
I'll help clean it up.
No, please, let me clean it up.
You keep writing.
(clicks tongue)
I think you're cracking.
You need to take your 15.
I don't need a 15; I'm gonna take a 15 more of work.
You need a 15; take a 15.
Pull it together.
I will not take a 15 ever again in my whole life.
I'm so sorry about this. Take a 15.
"She took a 15 on my face."
Focus.
Focus!
Nick: Sorry about the little misunderstanding there, all right?
(chuckles)
This oolong tea?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, Jess never gives me caffeine.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?
You know, this breakup has got me going crazy, Cece.
So you just need to calm down, okay?
I'm gonna need you to nurture me.
I'm gonna need you to nurture me.
Okay, all right, I can do that part. Here we go.
So, um, maybe this breakup isn't such a bad thing.
Mm-hmm.
Now you can stop wasting your life and find someone more realistic.
Yeah, someone who's, like, in your league.
What?
Because you don't want to die alone, so you kind of have to settle and lower your standards and find someone that's just, like, in your lane.
What...?
If you stay in your lane, you'll be happy, 'cause you won't be alone.
Right?
What are you saying?
Someone a little older, dumpier.
(crying): You are so bad at this.
For crying out loud.
Who do we give our laundry to?
The ad said it was included.
I suppose, I suppose me, uh, I guess.
Here you go.
Oh, dear Lord.
Where do the entertainment types tend to hang out?
Crystal is a performer.
We'd love to get her in front of the right set of eyes.
This is all underpants.
Showtime!
Mm... No, oh, no, no.
Crystal!
Schmidt: Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, honey, no acting.
I feel that you're gonna start a monologue of some sort, and I really don't want to hear it. I have no tolerance.
Please, I'm begging you.
(clears throat)
Is that your moment before? Please don't do that.
You don't know what out of order is, What the hell?
Mr. Trask!
If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place!
Pacino, Scent of a Woman.
I got the referen...
Wait a minute.
Is that my cashmere window pane blazer?
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.
Do you only do Pacino?
(kisses)
You knock him down.
Why don't you try knockin' me down now?
Rocky V?
No, no, in the ring.
Tommy g*n only fights in the ring.
Of all the Rockys?
Baby, let's do the cop one. Do Heat.
Don't do Heat. I'm... Oh, God.
'Cause she's got a great ass!
Nickolo.
What up, my man?
You got a weird vibe right now, bud.
I called Todd.
W-W... You just say, "Hi, what's up?
No.
Don't come to the bachelor party."
No, I made plans with him.
I'm gonna invite him and ask him to pay.
What?! You...
I'm sorry!
♪ I hear the blues a-callin' ♪
♪ Tossed salad and scrambled eggs ♪
Is she listening to Frasier reruns?
I'm in the middle of a fight with you.
There's this one episode, right?
Where Niles, he's making an origami flower, and Frasier comes in and asks...
Well, I'm sorry, actually, it's Daphne that comes in and asks...
Why'd you invite Todd!
Is that what Daphne asks?
'Cause if I'm Daphne, that's what I'm asking.
He sucks. I could've done it!
Then what does, uh, Frasier say?
You would never be Frasier in this scenario.
Who would I be?
Obviously the dad, the lazy piece of dump that sits on the chair.
And you just broke my heart.
(Kumiko giggles)
Cece: Well, the McQuaids sure left a mess.
Winston: Nick, I would just like to say that you had a vision for this hotel.
I'd also like to say that I may die alone.
It could happen.
Yeah.
Be nice if you surprised us.
I'll try.
Okay, look, Nick, I'm sorry that I called Todd.
You can suck Todd's gas till you're blue in the face, but I won't.
Not now, not ever.
I'll pay my own way to Tokyo, 'cause he hotel's still open, so...
Kumiko seems happy.
You could get some money back from her.
Yeah.
I ca... I'm not gonna charge her; I can't charge her.
What?
Why wouldn't you charge her?
Why can't you charge Kumiko?
To be honest, because we had a sexual encounter.
There we go.
Shame, shame.
Schmidt: I knew it, Nick!
You weren't in the bathroom fixing the shower.
You were showing her the business center.
Okay, in my defense, it wasn't in the shower.
It was in the hallway for a few moments.
Don't refer to it as a hallway. Yuck.
I literally meant the hallway.
And it was vibrant, if that's a word you could use in this situation, 'cause that's what it was; it was like...
Just admit it, Nick, you screwed up.
I did not screw up!
Well, you certainly can't charge her now.
Yes, I can.
Sure I can.
Hey, Kumiko.
Can I have a minute of your time?
(grunts)
(sighs deeply) I had a...
I enjoyed our special time today.
I haven't taken my pants off in front of a woman in quite some time.
I'm sorry that the pretzel fell out.
That was unexpected.
I honestly don't know how long it was in my underpants, and that was disturbing to me.
Thank you for not overreacting to it.
I'm here to talk about money.
American currency.
Our special time was not included, financially, in the room rate.
'Cause I'm running a business.
And I can't be soft here.
I understand.
I give you money.
Thank you for being so cool! That's what... Yes.
You are prost*tute.
Working boy.
No, no.
I want sex.
You want sex.
But need money.
prost*tute.
Hotel owner.
Sorry, Winston, I mean, this is all my fault.
No, no, no, no. No, Cece, you're fine.
You were right. You really were.
I mean, KC and I were, we weren't going anywhere.
Let's be honest.
I just want to find somebody, Cece; I really do.
So bad it hurts.
From my head to my turd pipe.
That's... sweet.
I got so much love to give, Cece.
I really do, so why am I always on the phone, getting dumped, crying my eyes out like an idiot?
Well, there must be something that you can do.
Well, you know, if Jess were here, she would tell me to: (imitating Jess) "Just believe in yourself, Winston, and, like, be positive."
Well, forget what Jess would say and forget what I would say.
What do you think would really break the cycle?
I just want, for once in my life, for someone to cry over me.
Right, okay, explore that.
Somebody to just cry because of...
That's a great idea, Cece!
It is?
Yes!
This is what I'm gonna do.
We're gonna make KC cry over me.
Oh, no, no, that's not, that's not where I thought you were going...
We're gonna make a girl cry today!
Couldn't take the money?
Thought you were a prost*tute?
(wry laugh)
It's time for Todd.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
You ever taken gloves off before?
We could've paid for Tokyo, but a business venture went south and ultimately, it was my fault because the company was my baby.
I can't believe you guys have never been to Tokyo.
I've been there 28 times!
Where do you guys get your sneakers?
28 times?
Yes.
And you idiots couldn't even figure out how to get there once?
Ha! You know what you deserve for that, Nick?
What?
You deserve a one-nut slap, my friend.
You're not slapping one of my nuts, Todd.
Oh, yes, I am.
I'm an adult man.
Tokyo?
Get that leg up, come on.
All right.
Get that nut!
This is for you, best man. We're going to Tokyo.
Yeah, get it up there. Here we go.
Ooh...
Okay, no!
S-Stop it!
What!?
Get your hand out of here!
Oh!
You're not slapping anybody's nuts.
Boo!
Schmidt: We don't need your money, Todd.
I'm gonna love my bachelor party, no matter what.
You're my best man. We're gonna do this.
Yeah, we can do this.
Do it anywhere we want to do it.
That's right.
It doesn't matter.
I do, however, still owe $9,000.
Wow. You guys are good friends.
Yep.
Yeah.
I don't have any friends.
No one likes me.
Ooh, why would you say that, Todd?
I have a terrible personality.
True.
(sobs quietly)
You're fake crying, aren't you?
No I'm not! I'm...
Yeah, all right, you guys caught me.
(choking)
I see it in your mouth.
Look, there she is.
Hey, Winston, I am not doing this, all right?
It is the worst idea that I have ever heard.
Uh, remember when you said, "I'm Cece. I'm super supportive"?
Now's your time to shine.
Yes, it isn't like a blank check, though.
This idea does not deserve to be supported, because it's insane.
Yeah, that's what I need, Cece!
I need insane!
Look, Cece, it's no big deal, but I need this more than I've needed anything in my entire life.
(groaning): I don't want to...
Cece: KC, um... I really... wish I didn't have to be the one to tell you this, but Winston is d*ad.
Wait, what?
Yeah, uh...
Oh, my God!
Uh, yeah, he...
Oh, my God!
You okay, babe?
No!
Oh, the...?
So you were...?
Well, then, um, KC, you should know that Winston's last words, right before the truck...
Oh. h*t him... were, um, "This is all KC's fault. And I wouldn't be d*ad if it wasn't for her."

Hah! (KC screams)
It's me and I'm alive!
He's alive!
Scared this dude.

Cece: Hmm...
Winston: Yeah.
What? What is going on?
Thank you for this, Cece. I needed this.
Yeah, you're welcome.
This means a lot.
Okay, but... Winston, I need you, I need you to go.
Hey, guy from the picture...
Mm-hmm if that's your real name... y'all look good together.

Cece: (chuckles) Bye.
Wait, who...?
I-I-I...
Oh, my God, that was so messed up.
You've changed my life, Cece.
Uh-huh.
The cycle is broken!
It's a whole new day.
From now on, the woman I'm in a relationship with is gonna be crying over me!
That shouldn't be the goal, though.
You know that, right?
I want some ice cream.
Never tell anyone we did this.
Can we get some ice cream?
Schmidt: Well, whose stuff is all this? Is Jess back?
Oh... (laughs)

Huh! Jess!

Is this cute?
Mmm? Polka dots?
Or... don't go anywhere.

Hmm...
I think that will look nice with your face and everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a good one.
That's nice.
Nick: You look pretty today.
Brandon: Thank you.
Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.
Please, I need you.
No, Nick.
It's a right and a privilege.
In South Africa, they don't even have juries.
They have a-a judge and two assessors.
God, I would have bullied you as a kid.
Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.
Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?
Yeah, I would.
I've turned in some memorable performances in the past.
But it's just one day... you'll be fine without me.
Now that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.
Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.
Ever since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.
When I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.
Not the same thing.
They're just boobs.
I promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.
She doesn't even live here.
She never signed our loft agreement.
She doesn't even know all the rules.
(laughing): Hi. Look at you.
You look so cute.
(chuckling): Thank you.
Cece: Love this top.
Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?
I know.
I've heard it four times this week.
So I take a hot glass out of the dishwasher, I pour cold water into it, then the customer picks up the glass, and the bottom falls off.
Oh, that's crazy.
For real?
Nick: He looks down, and he goes, like, (Italian accent): "Oh, my pants are wet."

I know, he-he needs to shape that story.
I don't know how you live with him.
He is the most obnoxious...

Hi. Didn't mean to startle.
Just wanted to know if you wanted some snacks during the movie.
I've just made a fresh pot of coffee.
We're Flip and Nancy.
Fred's parents.
Mm.
Oh. (laughs)
Fred lives with his parents.
Now I see where he gets his looks.
And his house. (laughs)
Guys, seriously.
I'm not... I'm not hungry.
You can't watch the movie on an empty stomach.
Hey, cool your jets until you have some of our coffee.
Beans are from Portland.
Oh, that's funny. (laughs) I'm from Portland.
Do you know my last book signing was at Powell's Books?
Oh, no way.
You're-you're a writer?
Well, I'm just a fool with a few stories.
Oh, you're just being modest.
And you are being lovely.
Oh!
(giggling)
You guys are so sweet together.
Flip: That's because we're still on our honeymoon.
35 wonderful years of marriage.
Feels like two to me.
Oh.
Nancy: Feels like one.
Flip: Like we just met.
Schmidt: Nick, what are we doing here?
Yeah. (laughter)
(clearing their throats)
Each-each of you know me.
Yeah.
If you don't, my name is Nicholas Miller.
I'm an American from Chicago.
I'm your new boss, so, you'll do what I say.
When the cave people went to the cave bar, and they asked for a drink on the rocks, they actually meant it. (laughs)
Now that we're all laughing...
It says, "Wait for laughs."
I...
Anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Please. Anything.
Your mother.
(laughter)
Your mother. I love it.
Thank you for breaking the ice.
I know!
(laughter)
I must look so stupid.
"Hey, get over here. I got a meeting."
What an idiot, huh?
It was that bad, huh?
No, Birdman was bad.
This... this was a disaster.
I'm here to help you, okay? Look, I have over nearly ten years of experience in the corporate world.
What's "over nearly ten"?
"Nearly ten" would be eight or nine years.
I have... I have over nine years.
That's different, yeah.
Got you a tie. Corporate 101.
Dress better than your employees.
Reminds them that they're inferior.
I'd wear a tie, but only on my butt, like it were a tail.
A tail tie.
Furguson, you have a knot!
Is that salt water in here?
You been hanging down at the wharf again?
Guess what? I took a chance with that guy Fred, and I'm in love.
That's incredible.
With his parents, but I'm in love!
Furguson, clear my schedule.
I need a word with your sister.
When Nancy was in Zimbabwe building clean water systems, Flip dropped everything to go over there and be with her, and they put Fred in Tribal School.
You seem like you're on cocaine.
Yeah, right. Flip and Nancy and I hate drugs.
Okay, yeah, great. What do you like about Fred?
Well, I didn't really get any time with him, 'cause Flip and Nancy wanted to watch the sunset.
Hey, do not talk to me like I'm some bastard who doesn't enjoy a good sunset.
But if you really want to be in a relationship...
Then I have to get to know Fred. Ha! You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna just cr*ck him open like a cold beer.
You know what's a good date?
Hmm?
Errands and a smoothie.
Okay, everyone, listen up.
Here are your new uniforms.
Oh, you got to be kidding.
Cece: Aah.
Save your groans for Birdman!
From now on, we will measure drinks.
Oh, man.
And we have a new one-napkin policy.
Just one napkin?
Questions at the end, please.
Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure?"
Nine times out of ten, they'll just back off and say "Thanks."
Now please go try on your new polos.
(all groaning)
Can I have a word with you?
Hey, Schmidt, everything you just said makes me want to give you a wedgie in front of the others.
You need to rule with an iron fist. No mercy.
You're not suggesting Cobra Kai rules?
I'm not doing it! They're my friends!
Your friends are gonna lose their jobs if this bar goes under.
Ooh! I never thought I would say this, but, give me the tie.
Now we're talking.
No mercy.
A corporate leader is born.
Don't-don't put it around your head.
Well, hello to you.
Hi. - Hi!
Fred'll be right down. You know, Nan and I are just packing up some books and paints for a park day!
A park day?!
Yes, it's from when we used to live in Paris.
You should come!
Well, look, um, I would love to, uh, but, um, I have to, uh, spend a little one-on-one time with, uh, this one.
When can chill with my parents.
Okay.
Yes!
Great!
Here's some paint.
Coffee?
I feel like I'm a car rental agent.
Yeah, well, you look like a prince.
Now, go. Go be a boss.
Hey, Cece.
Um, we measure our drinks now.
Am I right?
So, uh, do as I say.
(laughs) Of course. Use the thing.
Sorry, but, just, you know, it's important.
You know, with the... consist...
Is this the exact thing that you wanted to have happen?
I wouldn't want to get anything on my new uniform.
That's, like, six sh*ts.
So you have to charge...
That was some sass. You're at a real crossroads, so, you know, this is a big moment for you.
There is no fear in this dojo!
Nick: Hey, Javier?
Where's-where's your shirt?
Oh, it's so crazy, Nick.
Someone broke into my house last night and stole that ugly shirt.

I don't believe that.
Oh, it's boxy on me, dude.

Hey, no mother jokes.
Javier, do not slide that right now, okay?
I mean it. Do not...
You're fired.

Wha-What?
You changed, man.
That is some Jeffrey Tambor stuff, dude.
Javier, wait.
I-It's... Look, I wouldn't get...
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You just fired Javier?
You are out of control, Miller.
I'm not gonna take it anymore, and you guys shouldn't, either.
So let's show management exactly what we think of their policies. Let's walk!
I'm sorry, bae, you're gonna have to keep it separate.
Totally get it. Love you, bae.
All right. Let's go.
That was bad.
But can we just take a moment to appreciate Cece?
I mean, the effect that she has on people... it's really incredible.
I can't believe... she's marrying me.
I mean... like, what?
Oh, boy, Furguson, this knot is getting worse.

Jess: Hey, Winston.
This is Nancy and Flip and, um...
Hi! and, uh, we just went to the park, and we had a great park day, and we're gonna have Nice to see you. some, uh, wine before dinner.
Oh.
And it's gonna be awesome.
Oh, you should join us.
Yeah, come on!
Jess: You should join us.
A little sip.
You should.
Jess: Oh, yeah, for sure.
Definitely join us.
Join us.
Jess, a moment?
Jess, what the hell are you doing?
They're just the most amazing people I've ever met.
What happened to the one-on-one with Fred?
He's just so quiet... I can't get a read on him.
Jess... if you want a comfy, old relationship, you got to start somewhere.
All right? Go spend five minutes alone with him, now.
Go get some cheese for the wine.
Chevre is always nice.
But I wouldn't dare tell you how to buy cheese.
You're being so assertive right now... it's almost attractive.

I don't think that it's Furgy's knot that's bothering you.
Ooh.
I think that the knot that's bothering you is right there.

Uh, wow, I, um...
I don't know where I stand with my girl, and I can't talk to her, because I am ashamed.

Yeah, that's what I said.
Ashamed... of being beautiful? Of being a man?
Of being passionate?
Hah! Then I'm ashamed, too.
I say to you... let her in.

On the count of three? Oh.
Let her in.
No counting.

Okay, just go.
Fred: What a wonderful cheese store.
They had so many options.
That's good, 'cause I love cheese.
All kinds of cheese. Orange cheese, pizza cheese... I love all parts of pizzas, especially the dough.
Once I asked for a ball of dough, and they gave it to me and I took it to a park and ate it.

No!

So Fred's not shy, he just sucks.
When I asked him what his favorite hobby was, he said, "Towels."
I've got to break up with that human pile of saltine dust.
I love Flip! I mean, Flip taught me how to be vulnerable with KC, you know?
Yeah.
Nancy ear-candled me.
I can hear for miles.
Their relationship's just such an inspiration, and I want to be around it, but what can we do?
We ditch Fred. Forget about that dude.
We establish our own relationships with Flip and Nancy.
Boom! Make future plans with just them.
"Future plans" is redundant, but other than that, I am on board!
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna need some alone time with Flip and Nancy.
Can you stall Fred?

Of course I can stall Fred.
I would do anything. I love Flip and Nancy.

I hear you! I'm getting to you! Stop yelling at me!
Shut up!
I don't understand what Cece's doing here.
She led the walk-out. If she's gonna be here, can she at least help us?
I am not gonna scab.
Sorry, bae, I cannot scab, but I'm here for you as your fiancé.
You are my rock right now. Do you need anything?
No, I'm good, babe. Okay, just let me know if you do. We are screwed!
Hey! Shut up! I'm trying my hardest!
I shouldn't have fired Javier.
I got to apologize. This is all my fault.
Obviously, this is your fault... everybody knows that... but a boss never apologizes; it shows weakness.
I feel like if Javier came back, the rest of the staff would come back.
That's a great idea.
I just said that.
Such a great idea.
Well, then give me one, because I said it first.
If you're giving it for that idea, if it's about that idea, then I deserve one.
But I don't want one.
And I felt left out.

Shut up!
Well, I wonder what's taking them.
Probably just the traff. You know, the old 'ic.

Those stairs may have broken my body, but they did not break my spirit.
And with that, I rise.
Honey, you're not... You just need to... Yeah, relax. Okay.
You definitely can't go to this party.
(sighs) I got to go and tell him.
I got to go tell him before she gets there.
I'll call Nick, and I'll have him stall her.
Okay.
I don't think I can. You have no idea how anxious this woman is to get to the party.
No, no, no, I told you, we're not there yet.
You got to stay plugged in.
You're such a pill.
Well, just take her to the mall, get her some soft serve.
Be sure to save your receipts. I'll reimburse you from the party fund.
Got to go.
Mrs. Parikh, can you keep a secret?
I'm going to k*ll this soft serve nonsense.
(whimpers) You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna play laser tag! (screaming)
(shouting in Hindi) What are you doing?!
We're gonna play laser tag!
It's a fun American game! It's a fun game!
Both: Groomsmen! Yeah. (whoops)
Mmm.
Ah. Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.
Now, who are you? I'm Groomsman Number Two.
(chuckles) Big Schmidt, Schmidt's cousin.
I'm Robby, Groomsman Number Four.
I am the ex-boyfriend of the bride, and a weirdly close friend of the groom.
I'm Number Five, J. Cronkite Valley-Forge.
CFO of Associated Strategies, LLC.
I'm 62 years of age, was recently widowed, and I believe earnestly that if we can all work together this wedding season, we will get more boom-boom than a TNT factory.
Yeah! (men laughing)
Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time.
I have a brief statement from G3, who could not make it here tonight.
It says, "Dear Jess, I can't fly in for every damn party.
"I will see you at... (imitates Coach): the wedding."
If you know Coach, that's exactly how he...
"Wedding."
Yeah, yeah.
And then he always goes, "Coach."
(laughs)
Now, me, myself, I am Winston Bishop.
Officer Winston Bishop?
The Winston Bishop? The Carport Hero?
I knew it was you. I saw you on TV, man.
Officer, you make me want to be a better man.
I'm gonna stop, uh, peeing in my ex-wife's mailbox.
Winston: No, seriously, everybody, calm down.
Act normal around me.
I'm a fun guy. I do pranks.
Uh, Cece's last wedding? The badger that fell down and almost k*lled a bunch of people... that was me!
(chuckles)
I'm Prank Sinatra, baby!
Old Brown Eyes.
Ain't no prank like a badger prank, because a badger prank got badgers, and it's dangerous as hell!
Ms. Parikh.
Who are you?
Oh. My goodness. Of course.
I must be completely unrecognizable to you from the countless photos you must have seen.
In honor of your visit, I stood the humble recipient of a professional shampoo.
So you're the man who's marrying my daughter?
Sure am.
No wonder she didn't tell me that she was engaged.
Oh.
Oh, no, then.
I'm assuming she was afraid I would disapprove.
But now that you've met me...
I disapprove.
Strong disapprove.
Let's take a moment to applaud your daughter's instincts.
No, no, no. Look, Schmidt. Mom.
I'm sorry. I can explain everything.
Presenting...
Cece's mom! (Schmidt groans)
Except for that.
I'm her mom.
You're her mom?
That's my mom.
Then who are you?!
Not her mom.
That's her mom!
A dumb little boy you are!
(phone ringing)
Yeah. Hello.
So, does Cece's mom love Schmidt, or what?
Which Cece's mom? The real one or the one I may have kidnapped?
Th-The real one?
(elevator bell dings)
Glen: Anything for Officer Bishop!
The Carport Hero!
Thanks, Glen. Sorry to army crawl into your home like that.
We come from a country of 400 million men.
Let's say half of them are no good.
Another half, very ugly.
That's still 100 million eligible men.
Sure, ten percent are gay.
Puts us at 90 million men.
Ms. Parikh, I love Cece.
Cut it in half again just for fun.
45 million men.
Cece, when were you gonna tell her?
I'm sorry.
On our wedding day when we were standing beneath our custom hybrid mandap-chuppah?
(crying): I'm so sorry. I just... I wanted the moment to be right.
I'm sorry.
(tires screech)
We meet again.
(shouting): Hello! Is anyone here?!
(horn honks fanfare)
Jess?
Winston! Oh, thank God!
I need your help.
Hey, Jess, let me ask you something.
Uh, I'm a fun guy, right? I mean, I have a way about me.
Winston, look at me, look around.
Does your thing seem important now?
You're the Carport Hero. Now I need your help.
No more Carport Hero!
Tonight, I'm Prank Sinatra.
No. No! You didn't play a prank...
You are the worst prankster in the world!
Every prank you do turns out either too big...
What is it?
Did you register me as a sex offender? (snickers) or too small.
How'd this blueberry get in here?
(mumbles): I don't...
(laughs)
(whoops)
You should have saw your face!
He did not see that coming.
Just like no one's gonna see what's coming tonight.
Nothing should be coming tonight.
I'm sorry, Jess.
The fuse has already been lit.
The lion has spotted the gazelle.
The doo-doo is already mid-flight to the fan.
The silly hounds have been released.
I repeat: the silly hounds have been released.
What did you d... You know what, never mind.
Just take me to Cece and Schmidt, please.
I did a prank. I did a... Oh.
(Winston grunting)
(grunting continues)
I hope the scooter fits in the elevator.
There's an elevator?
(speaking Hindi)
I'm trying to find out where to return you.
(speaking Hindi)
You have pepper spray?
Why didn't you use that on me?
(speaking Hindi angrily)
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Well, Cece's mom hates me.
Like Jay Z, I have 99 problems.
But unlike Jay Z, I have zero caveats.
I know, and I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry I screwed up my easy job.
(speaking Hindi angrily)
And stop being so mean to me, or I swear to God I'm gonna fall in love with you!
(speaking Hindi angrily)
Where you going? Come back.
(sighs)
Let me make it up to you.
I know that I said I wanted the easy job.
But screw that.
I'm the best man, Schmidty.
I want the hard jobs.
I can handle it.
So what do we got? What do we need?
We're past hard at this point.
We're well into impossible.
It's an unfixable situa...
(horn honks fanfare)
Schmidt, I did not just drive 15 miles on a gout throne to watch you give up.
Especially not...
♪ In the Year... of Us. ♪
Look at yourself.
Look around us.
Maybe this isn't our year.
I have a plan.
And whatever it is, I'm in. I got this guy's back.
Don't think we actually need...
I know, but I'm in, is what I'm saying.
That... I mean...
♪ Whatever it is, I want in. ♪
Okay, whatever.
I want in.
Schmidt, how important is this to you?
Have I made that clear?
That I want to be, like, a third.
You can be in. You're in.
You're in.
Thanks.
That's all I wanted her to say.
Are you willing to do whatever it takes?
Of course.
I also didn't love the tone that, like, "I'm in, but who cares that I'm in?"
Jess (over speakers): Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention please?
Hello.
I'm Jessica Day.
I'm the maid of honor, but when I fell down the stairs, I wished I was made of rubber.
(laughs)
(man coughing quietly)
Uh...
This one goes out to the secret romantic in the audience.
Just a little reminder that love...
(chuckles) conquers all.
And without further ado, MaHotMoves Gandhi.
Follow me, follow me.
Follow me!
(upbeat Indian music playing)
(upbeat Indian music continues)
Think they're all really friends?
You know, I mean, when the dancing day is done?
(crowd cheering)
(upbeat Indian music continues)
(crowd laughing, cheering)
(upbeat Indian music continues)
(music ends, crowd cheering)
(whoops)
(Jess laughs)
Hey.
That was great.
Fantastic.
Wonderful.
Jess: Where'd she go?
Jess: Mrs. Parikh? Please, wait.
Stop. Look. (sighs)
It was my idea.
I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.
You really think a dance is all it takes?
Cece: Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.
Or what I imagined.
I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.
None of us did.
Quiet, Chair.
But I love him.
He makes me so happy, and I'm gonna marry him.
I will not give my blessing.
Cece, Schmidt...
(groaning): Oh, God.
Crunch. Ah...
sh**t me.
(sighs)
You have my blessing.
You have my blessing, too.
Mine, too.
Oh, come on, Not-Cece's mom.
That would've been awesome.
It was a natural three.
You got to finish.
We'll get her on board.
I promise.
Oh, she's gonna get hers.
No, no, Winston, no.
What did you do? No pranks.
Such bad timing.
Hey, Mrs. Parikh.
Check your shoe.
(Winston snickers)
Tickle foot! (laughs)
I put a feather in your shoe!
(laughing)
Too small, dude.
Way too small.
I've revised my vision.
Honey, without my mom's help, I don't think we can afford to parachute the rabbi in.
Well, that's why I've pared it down to only the things that matter.
That's great.
We can throw a wedding on a budget.
This is our year.
We can do anything.
Now, who's gonna take me to the john?
Not it!
Really?
You're the only girl here.
I can't. It hurts my back.
Who keeps giving her juice?
You're in a senility scooter; use a diaper!

(laughs quietly)
That's a good tickle.
(laughs): Oh.
Easy, Winnie.
There he is.
Mr. New York. Mr. Broadway.
Happy last day.
I made you this.
Aw.
It's a bunch of pictures of you.
Well, I had to take the necessary precautions, because the last time you left, you forgot who I was.
You called me Jebecca.
Well, thank you so much, Jess. I really like it.
Cool.
Yeah.
Well, that's a kick in the shins.
Look, nothing personal, but, you know, I've moved a lot, so I have this system that I use.
Duffel bag full of essentials only.
And... one Jess cube.
You can't get rid of me.
Look, Jess, when I move, I make a clean break, okay?
I'm not going to get all sentimental.
And you promised you wouldn't make a big deal.
No, you're right, you're right. I promised you I wouldn't.
You did.
But... what about everyone else?
Showtime!
h*t it, Schmidt!
Huh?
Oh. ("New York, New York" plays)
Nick, where's your Donald Trump wig?
It's here.
Jess: Ugh.
This was not my vision.
I specifically said "dazzle."
You said "razzle-dazzle," and we said, "We don't want to do that."
Yeah, we told you this is not what he would want.
This isn't how men say good-bye.
(imitating Don Pardo): Live from New York, it's Coach's good-bye!
♪ Start spreading the news... ♪
Yeah, show's over.
We ain't doing this?
♪ I'm leaving today ♪
♪ I want to... ♪
Coach: The system works.
Remember, essentials only.
It's not just for packing; it's a way of life.
You want to move forward, you got to get rid of the past.
That means throw out all your junk...
Right...
Emotional junk, actual junk.
Got to make a clean break.
Clean break. That's right.
You're bl*wing my mind right now, Coach.
Doesn't even mean anything.
Or does it mean everything?
Jess: I cannot believe you're all buying into Coach's crazy system.
You guys have fun with your clean break.
I'm gonna go to my room, and I guess I'll have to cancel the horse and carriage that I hired to take you to the airport.
May and I are driving.
Jess: You are now.
You guys sure you're up for this?
I am ready for this. I'm single again.
I'm a new man. I'm leaving the past behind.
Nick: I want to get rid of my stuff, but all my stuff is really, really good, and I just can't get rid of it.
It's not, and you have to.
Everything you own is trash.
You're basically a hoarder.
Not true.
Everything has meaning.
Everything is connected to something else.
You need to be hard on yourself, okay?
Now, take this box and fill it up.
Okay...
Think I can do it?
Absolutely.
Okay. I'm gonna get hard and fix myself.
What?
That's not... No.
That's... I didn't... No.
Oh, here we go.
The Regis Philbin crepe pan.
Come on, Coach. You can't give this away.
Remember February 2014?
Or, as we like to call it, Crepe History Month.
Crepe History Month.
Winston: It was a hot winter's night.
We were drunk, but our judgment was on point.
Regis philbin (over tv): You hear that sizzle?
Let that sizzle speak!
Those pancakes are paper-thin.
There's only three left, so act fast.
This crepe pan... is a knockout!
Coach, we got to act fast.
We got to act fast.
We got to act fast!
They're so thin!
(both yelling)
You got to take the Rege, at least for the memories.
The Rege, man.
The Rege!
You know, I can't get rid of the Rege.
Can't get rid of the...
Psych!
I'm getting rid of the Rege.
Memories are nonessential, all right?
That's what makes the system work.
I found an ant farm full of candy wrappers.
Is this essential?
Like, really, what do you think?
Hmm? I need you to get harder, Nick.
Can you get harder for me?
What?
Do you need me to get hard with you?
I feel like you're not... meaning to say what you're saying.
Talking about cleaning up.
Schmidt, I think you forgot about this box.
Oh, oh, that's cool. Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
Oh... you got a Cece box.
So what? It's not like everybody hasn't seen your Phylicia Rashad box.
No, you hav... You have?
Birthday card...
Don't... please don't go in the Cece box. Don't do... a crude drawing of... you and Cece and your mixed-race child.
Yes, I painted that.
Ooh, five dollars! Come to daddy.
This five dollars belongs in the box.
It's from the night that I first met Cece.
Looks like it's finally just the two of us, huh?
Oh, God, you're about to say something stupid, aren't you?
Yeah.
Girl...
And then I said something stupid, and Cece made me put money in the douche bag jar.
What'd you say? You say you can flex your butt cheeks like pecs?
I bet you were all like, "You're making my dong go crazy!"
Winston: I bet he said something chauvinistic...
(laughs) ...that comes from insecurity but ultimately leads to something endearing.
You know, it doesn't matter what I said.
Nonessential, right?
Exactly.
So, good-bye, Cece.
May some poor street urchin with a perfect 34-D enjoy the sports bra that you left in my car.
Winston: We got to tell Schmidt that Cece is in love with him.
Right now, he is out there throwing away all of his Cece mementos, acting like he's just going to move on.
Jess, I cannot watch this when I know what I know.
I know.
We got to tell him.
I promised her I wouldn't get involved.
I always meddle. I've learned my lesson.
She's trying to get Schmidt out of her system, and we have to support her, even if it means letting her climb a mountain with no prior knowledge or experience.
Yeah, but does she know that Schmidt and Fawn broke up?
Is she getting our voice mails?
I don't know. She hasn't called me back.
Maybe there's no reception on the top of Mount Shasta.
(snaps fingers) We try again.
Hey, Cece, it's Je...
Hey, yo, Ceec, what up, fam?
It's your girl Winston, aka Winnie the Bish, aka-ak-aka Brown Lightning.
Schmidt dropped Fawn like a bad habit, okay, so ain't nobody riding g*n.
So you better get on while the getting is good.
You got it?
I hate that you're so good at this.
I was so nervous.
Look at all this crap.
Look at this.
"Associated Strategies."
"Ass Strat." What a joke.
More like "Butt Strat." This place is total butt.
Hey, Jess, it's our sex mug.
What?
What?
Oh... nothing.
It's just a mug that Nick and I used for sex.
Oh, gross. Like, in it?
Ew! What?
No. No, we used it when we were dating.
It was hard to find times to be intimate with everyone around, so we needed to come up with a code.
Just a way to let each other know we were aroused without arousing suspicion.
That's wordplay.
It's also a free writing lesson.
Jess: When one of us left the mug on the entryway table...
"Ass" out meant it was time to...
Make love...
Bone.
Yeah, make love.
We're getting rid of this thing... especially since you guys aren't using it anymore, right?
Nick and jess: Right.
Wrong.
I, Winston L'Andre Bishop, saw that very mug on this very hallway table just last week...
"Ass" very out.
Ooh...!
Jess: Winston, that mug hasn't seen any action in over a year.
You're off your rocker.
If I were off my rocker, would I take a weekly selfie with my cat?
Oh, Winston.
You see, just last week, I took this selfie with...
(chuckling): Wait, not that one.
(Winston laughing)
That's crazy. Not that one. I forgot I had this one.
This selfie, in front of that table.
Sex mug. Question is, who put the mug out?
All right, let's not play the "who put the mug out" game.
We should be focusing on Coach.
I saw you checking out Jess's butt last week.
No.
Yes, she was wearing the "look at me" skirt.
All right, well, let's not try to...
My money's on Jess.
Wait.
She hasn't had sex since Ryan, and desperate times call for Nick Miller.
Is the "look at me" skirt the green one?
Hey. Do not change the subject.
You are implicating yourself by changing the subject like that.
Hey!
I put the mug out.
Okay? And, actually, nothing happened, and I regret nothing.
Now, I'm going to my room, and I'm considering throwing out my sunglasses.
So long, old friend.
(sighs)
Just doesn't feel right.
(chuckles): Welcome back, old friend.
(knocks) Hey.
Got a second?
Jess, we don't have to talk about it.
Obviously, I was the one who put the mug out, so I wanted to thank you for covering for me.
No problem.
Obviously, we're broken up, and it was... a moment of weakness.
I didn't even know you put it out; I didn't see it.
Oh!
No harm, no foul.
Well...
We didn't bone.
No bone, no phone home.
Great. So we're cool.
I'm cool if you're cool.
Fanterstic.
I'm going to knit a scarf for Coach.
I'm sure he'll love it.
Okay, bye.
Thanks for the chat.
Sayonara.
Hey, Nick, uh, do you want to know why I put the mug out?
We're cool!
We're cool.
Go knit that scarf.
Right.
(door closes)
(whispers): Okay.
No, no, no! Cece!
I want it back! I want it back!
Pop, pop, little bubble!
Let that sizzle speak.
It's time to flip. Care to do the honors?
Ah, sure, man. That'd be cool.
Rude.
Winston, you're not gonna trick me into taking the stupid pan.
It stays behind... that's the system!
Clean break.
You know what, fine, Coach, don't take it with you.
Leave everything behind.
Try not to remember anyone.
We are nonessential.
Message received.
Nah, Coach, I don't think so.
Because this crepe belongs in the belly of someone with a heart.
(sighs)
Damn it!
Ouch!
(groans)
Why are you so secure?
You're filled with things that nobody wants!
Oh. Thank God.
Hey, how are you?
I dropped something in the bin, and I need it back.
You Jewish?
I just need a bo... I just need a box.
I just can't part with you.
Okay, I'll tell you what happened.
You knit fast.
Winston had fallen asleep polishing his candelabra.
I had just opened a bottle of pink wine, and then you showed up.
Nick: Oh, hey.
Just working out.
Got to sweep the temple.
♪ ♪
(groaning, growling)
Damn...
So, see, it wasn't my fault.
In your defense, I've been working on my body, doing my burpees, and it shows.
(knees crackling)
(knees crackle)
(winded): I'm not gonna do that again.
Nick...
Warrior pose!
Nick, is there anything that I do that makes you think about putting the mug out?
No, I-I can't think of anything.
Right.
It's just not the way that this old brain works.
Clean break.
Great. Clean break. I agree.
Jess, hold on. Hey, hey... H-How is that...?
Jess, wait!
Yeah, I'm stuck.
Well, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.
How do I know this is your box?
Do you have any identification, "Cece"?
Cece's my ex-girlfriend; it's a box of her things.
But I can tell you everything that's in there.
There's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.
Why would you have her brassiere?
Well, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.
She never asked for it back?
Okay, um, Wally, look, it's a box of memories.
Memories that I'm not ready to let go of yet.
Maybe if I could talk to Cece...
Can't talk to Cece; Cece's on top of a mountain.
Look, I know this is unusual, but I need that box back, Wally.
I need it back more than anything else I've ever needed in my life.
Please.
Does she know she's on the mountain, or is she being held there against her will?
Damn it, Wally, give me the box!
No! No!
No! No!
(whistle bl*wing)
Wally!
Stop bl*wing the whistle!
You're sexually safe!
Coach, is that a bigger bag?
My old bag broke, so I got a wheelie.
Same system.
Still only essentials.
(pan clangs)
Is there a pan in there?
Nah. Nah, that's not a pan.
That was just, uh, the sound of two track pants hitting together.
You know, the buttons be like... ting... ti...
But, um... (clears throat)
Yeah, since I got this new suitcase, I might as well take a few more things.
Just to fill up space. Know what I mean?
Just to fill up space.
Like, uh... take these glass grapes.
Just to fill up space.
Not that I want them.
Of course not.
And this blanket.
For cushioning.
(moans)
That smells nice, huh?
For cushioning, dude.
These mystery novels.
Take these.
Not 'cause they're Jess's, just because...
I'm an avid reader now.
Stop smiling at me, man.
I'm taking Nick's workout jams.
'Cause, uh... that one time I trained him, (voice breaking): saw a lot of results.
(voice breaking): I remember. He was so fat.
And I'm taking this remote.
Because you always h*t the info button by mistake.
No, no, it's not by mistake, Coach.
(sobbing softly)
I like to know more about the cast and crew.
Remote's gonna miss this TV so much.
Our TV is gonna miss that remote.
(sobs)
(sniffs)
Smells like all our fingers.
(both sobbing)
(wailing)
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
Do you really think I haven't thought about putting this mug out?
Oh, I don't know, Nick. You said it.
What's past is past. Clean break.
Think about my living conditions for the past year.
I live across the hall from my beautiful ex-girlfriend.
And your living conditions... you live across the hall from your beautiful ex-boyfriend.
Two true beauties.
So you have thought about it.
I'm a man.
I am a human man.
Interesting.
You're the one who's always getting out of that shower in that little towel, Jess.
Or you're wearing your glitter or your pantyhose.
They're driving me crazy! Okay?
I know how hard it is to get those pantyhose up, and I just... I just sometimes want to rip 'em down.
Just admit it, Miller!
You're thinking about putting the mug down right now!
No.
Admit that you want me to be thinking about it.
I don't want you to think about it, so stop thinking about it.
Well stop talking about it and then I'll stop thinking about it.
So, you are thinking about it?
Look, Jess!
I'm not not... thinking about it.
(door opens)
Hey, guys. Want to know what happened to me today?
Jess and nick: We're kind of in the middle of something...
Fine, I'll tell you.
I spent $500 to get back a five dollar bill.
Go ahead, call me a fool.
You won't be the first person to call me that today.
You're a fool!
I need to move on.
I'm never gonna get Cece back.
And I know it's my fault that I lost her.
Nick: You lost her twice.
You had her...
I know I lost her twice.
Why would you have to...?
Then you got her, then you blew it.
Then you got her...
Who are you clarifying this for?
Are you sure you know how Cece feels about you?
Yeah, I mean, she said a thousand times that she only wants to be friends with me.
Schmidt...
Jess, Cece doesn't love me and she never will.
So I think it's time to let go.
Nick, I want you to have this five dollars.
What?
Go buy yourself something special, like a burrito.
I love burritos.
Oh, I have to tell you something, Schmidt!
I... (groans)
But I can't tell you.
(groans) So, I'll...
I'll tell you. Loophole!
Nick...
Cece's in love with Schmidt.
What?
(sighs) Yeah.
For real?
Well...
Also, Winston promised...
Why are we talking about Winston?!
Winston...
Cece loves me! Nick, we did it!
I got to go!
Can't wait for Cece to get back from her trip.
I'm going after her. Coach... (sighs)
I used to wish that you were uglier.
I don't wish that anymore.
I only wish you the best.
Hey, you're the handsome one in the loft now.
Big responsibility, but I think you're ready.
All right, you guys, I'm off.
Off to climb a mountain.
I'll see you in autumn.
Winter at the latest.
Good luck, Schmidt.
Yeah.
You go get her!
Okay.
Coach: Find that girl.
Winston: See you, Schmidt!
Jess: Bye!
Cece!
Cece.
Hey, um... so, I was, I was on the top of this mountain, and I finally got cell reception and there were, like, 20 voice mails from...
Are you in love with me?
Because I'm in love with you.
Deeply.
But I assumed that you would never because I've...
I've messed this up so many times.
And you've made it very clear that you just want to be friends with me and I value that friendship so much.
So if I'm ruining it by doing any of this, please, please stop me!
Schmidt.
I'm in...
I'm in love with you.
(quietly cheering)
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of stupid how much I'm in love with you.
You should've seen how fast I came down that mountain.
I mean, a lot of it was falling.
Luckily, the ground just stopped me, but...
You remember this?
Looks like it's finally just the two of us, huh?
Oh, God, you're about to say something stupid, aren't you?
Yeah.
Girl, I'm-a marry you.
Jar.
I know this might seem crazy, uh, and... probably a little bit impulsive, but it's not.
Not for me.
I've known since the minute that I met you.
(gasps) Oh, my God.
Cecelia Parikh...
Oh, God, you're gonna say something stupid, aren't you?
Girl, will you marry me?
(all gasping, screaming, laughing)
Would you please shut up?! I can't hear the answer!
Oh. Shh. Yeah.
Yes!
(all cheering)
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
We're getting married!
(all cheering)
(chattering happily) We did it!
Go say bye.
Uh...
I love you guys and, uh...
I'm gonna miss you.
Especially you, Jebecca.
Aw.
(all laugh)
All right, man.
All right! Aw.
We're gonna miss you.
Bye, buddy.
Good-bye, Coach.
See you, man.
See you, Coach!
Save the date! Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Don't ever change, Coach.
See you at the wedding!
He's gonna change.
Nick: Later!
Jess: Bye!
Winston: See you, buddy!
Schmidt: See you!
Adios.

Clean break?

Cece and Schmidt are in my room.
Oh, sure. (crying nearby)
Oh, Cece's crying.
Aw.
Aw.
(high-pitched crying)
I can't believe this is happening.
It's everything that I've ever wanted.
Okay, I know. Me, too.
But... we can't have sex if you keep crying.
I'm gonna stop.
Great.
I'm gonna stop.
Great!

(speaking indistinctly)
(whispering): Coach and May are fighting. We don't want to disturb them.
They're not fighting.
I know how to read body language. Look.
Her arms are crossed in a position of dominance, and he's playing his forehead like a piano.
Winston: Will you clowns focus?
My waffle is in the toaster, and if I wait too long after it pops, it'll get hard.
Look, I know about relationships.
Winston can vouch for me.
That girl, KC, just texted him,
"What's up?"
That riddler.
So I had him text back an empty bubble.
Is he thinking about her? Or is a baby playing with the phone?
She don't know, but she want to know.
There she is. There she is.
Oh.
Jess: Hey.
Morning.
Hello. - How do?
Hey. Oh, someone left a waffle in the toaster.
Bye, guys.
Man, this waffle had better be hot or I am going Durst on y'all.
Hey...
Coach.
Why...
Jess, are you talking like that?
She thinks you and May are fighting.
No, we're not fighting.
(chuckles)
We did break up, though.
(gasps) Oh, my God, I knew it.
I mean, I'm so sorry. What happened?
May accepted a job in New York as a section musician for the Met.
Oh, has Alan taken a liking to her? Oh, bravo.
Good for... You know, I've always been a fan of his.
When he conducted, uh, Das Rheingold with the Royal Stockholm Orchestra, it was magnificent.
Jar or slap?
I don't have any cash on me.
Good slap.
Jess: Are you okay?
Do you want to talk about it?
No, I'm good. Yeah. I'll miss her, but... we're still friends. We're cool.
I'm cool.
Cool.
Nick: All right.
He is not good.
Winston, get back here! We need to powwow about May and Coach!
Winnie's gonna need a minute.
What are you reading? What is...
One Woman's Journey Up Inside Herself?
It's really inspiring. I actually want to be the woman in this book.
"Finding inner strength in a time of crises."
Cece, are you in crises?
I'm fine. Cece's fine.
How are you? How's Fawn holding up?
If you must know, my paramour Councilwoman Fawn Moscato has been so strong since the incident.
(indistinct chatter)
You know, reporters are calling it Panty-Gate.
There's pictures of her naked lady-bottom all over the Internet. Sid, put the phone away.
You picked it up right when I said "naked lady-bottom."
Please. You guys are good, then?
You know, 'cause the last time we spoke, you said you were feeling a little, you know, used.
Well, not anymore. We're a team now.
Fawn and Schmidt.
Fawmidt.
Vomit?
No, Fawmidt.
You're saying the word "vomit."
No, I don't hear that, but okay.
Fawn's holding a press conference later today, and I don't mean to toot my own shofar, but I'll be standing there right by her side.
So this scandal is actually bringing you two closer together.
Team Fawmidt has never been stronger.
I heard it there.
Wow, that sounds exactly like "vomit."
That's a problem.
Mm-hmm.
"Roughly the same length as The Pearl."
How is that a pull quote?
And that... is how babies get made.
It's gross, right?
How does the sperm find the egg?
Propelled by its tail, the sperm travels up the canal until it reaches the egg.
Now, for us, it's only a couple of inches, but for Mr. Sperm there it's miles away.
Miles and miles and miles away.
(sighs) It's almost like... why would the egg want to be so far away from the sperm?
You know? Like, didn't the egg and the sperm have a great time together?
And then you're just gonna pack your bags and leave and go to New York?
To play music with some other sperm.
You're just-just gonna leave? You're gonna leave your sperm and go play music with other sperms?
And I'm cool with that! I'm cool with that!
You know, I got eggs. I have eggs on deck!
This sperm got swag. All those other sperms ain't got swag like me. Can any other sperm sport this much green and still look dope? No!
That ain't tight! This is tight!
This is tight!
(crying): I just want you to come back, and I... (sniffles)
I guess I chose the wrong day to observe Health.
Coach (crying): I miss her!
May.
Listen, thanks for standing next to me up there, Ponyboy.
I hope this show of remorse will keep these reporters off my back.
Oh, I know it will. And then, you know what, once this is over, maybe we get out of here for a little bit. Lay low, - Oh.
Rent a cabin in the woods, Yeah.
Read some poetry, have horizontal sex.
Okay, two of those three things sound like fun. Now, here's your statement in case you're asked any questions.
Oh, a st...
I'm not gonna need a statement. I'm a seasoned improviser.
Hey, guys. We're the Belly Laughs.
So, I need a location.
Boy: How 'bout fat camp?
(laughter)
That's adorable. But just, please, read what I wrote.
I will. But I'm not gonna do it until I get out there.
You're gonna want me in the moment for this.
Okay.
(reporters clamoring)
Good afternoon.
Um, before I answer any of your questions, my partner would like to read a statement.
Honey.
I am a sick man.
On Saturday last, Councilwoman Moscato was caught not wearing underpants because I...
I asked her not to wear them.
Why?
Because it turns me on.
What I did was wrong. I'm so sorry, Fawn.
I'm sorry, Los Angeles.
And I'm sorry to the man upstairs, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Dress shirts on a Monday?
You know how it is.
Coach breaks up with a lady, we take him out, and he gets loaded.
Yeah, I know how it usually goes when Coach breaks up with a girl, but May is different.
Sometimes she comes over and they don't even have sex.
I don't get that.
Trust me, I am right about this, just like I was right about them fighting.
I'm on, like, a streak here. I might just be... an expert in love. Like a... you know, like a love doctor, if you will.
I will not. You are the least qualified person to call themselves a doctor of love.
Exhibit "A": you dated me.
I rest my case. (chuckles)
Court is adjourned.
Guilty as charged.
(laughs)
Put... I would stop that.
Case... rested. Listen, I got to say I agree with Nick on this one, Jess.
I mean, it's been a whole day, and KC still hasn't texted me.
Well, that's just proof that the bubble is working.
Look, you guys, Coach needs to talk to May.
Trust me. He is in pain.
I'm happy and I'm healthy and I'm ready to party!
(laughs) Let's get drunk! (laughing)
(whoops) You're wrong.
Coach. (chuckles) (Coach grunts)
Do you want to talk about what happened today or...
Talk about what?
No. (chuckles)
(Nick and Winston laugh) Hey, um, actually, can you do me a favor?
May's gonna be recording later.
She's gonna stop by and pick up her rubber circle.
May has a diaphragm?
No, it's the thing that you put on the floor to s*ab the cello.
Condom.
No.
No, it's the thing you put on the floor to make sure the cello stays put.
Cello s*ab.
Oh, yeah. Cello s*ab.
Oh. Well, wouldn't you like to be here when she comes by?
No, that's gonna be hella weird. I want to party!
(laughs) Yeah!
(indistinct cheering)
I'm gonna do this and gonna do this, this, this, this, this.
(sighs)
What was that speech?
I'm sorry, okay? I told you to read the statement beforehand and then you told me that terrifying story about doing improv at a fat person's camp.
I didn't know that the statement was gonna blame me for Panty-Gate.
And by the way, for your information, the Belly Laughs did not "do" improv. We reinvented it.
I know you must be embarrassed, but... you saved me.
Yeah, well, people think I'm a sicko now.
One of your aides spit at me.
Was it Shallon? Yeah, that's a lisp, but still, he's fired. Look, if you want to leave, I completely understand.
But the truth is...
I can't do this without you.
Well, now Ponyboy is feeling very conflicted.
Just one last photo op.
You and I having a lovely evening.
Show the press everything's back to normal.
And then I promise it'll just all be about us.
Could we do horizontal sex?
Yes.
With foreplay?
It's a deal-b... It's a deal-breaker. It's a - Uh... Yeah.
Deal-breaker. Okay.
Fine, yes, fine, yes.
Oh, God.
No, please. Oh...
Oh, God.
(knocking) May.
Cece!
So Coach a May broke up?
Long story short, they shouldn't have broken up and I am the only person that sees this. I realize I'm kind of an expert in love.
A love doctor if you will.
Where are your crackers?
A-Above the fridge.
Cece, did they raise your tuition again?
Why are you so hungry?
I've decided I'm going to climb Mount Shasta.
By yourself?
I'm leaving for three weeks. I want to like the woman in the book, I want to go on a climbing trip and find myself.
Okay, um... Ceec, are you sure you're ready for a climbing trip?
Jess, I just... I can't sit here and watch Schmidt with Fawn.
And I don't think they're breaking up any time soon, so...
Cece, they're never gonna last. He doesn't really love her.
Did he tell you that?
No, but... as a doctor of love, I sense these things.
(knocking)
The Love Doctor just knows.
May.
Hi.
Uh, I'm here for my endpin anchor.
Yeah.
Ah, thank you.
Very sorry to hear about the breakup. Are you okay?
Um, yeah. Yeah.
I'm here to talk if you ever need to. In hard times, it's nice to have a friend, May.
Thanks... Jess.
Right?
Yes.
Well, uh...
I'm in the middle of a recording session.
I got to get back to the studio, so... see ya.
Bye.
Yeah, Jess, she looks real broken up about it.
(knocking)
I... I'm a mess.
I know!
(crying)
(whispers): The doctor is in.
Wait, what?
Nothing. Cry it out.
Mmm! Ah.
Wow.
I have never seen Coach go this hard after a breakup, man.
You sure he's okay?
It's good, it's good, it's good.
You treat an outside wound with rubbing alcohol, you treat an inside wound with drinking alcohol.
That's science.
I feel that, man.
It is time to turn things up.
Sidney...
Do what you do! (chuckles)
("Black Velvet" by Alannah Myles begins playing)
Aw... (short chuckle)
This is my jam.
Y: We've only been dating for a few months. I just thought that... that breaking up was, like, the smart thing to do, you know?
I know you're upset, sweetie, but I... I can't understand anything you're saying with the crackers.
Do you love him?
I think I do.
Well, then, maybe moving to New York doesn't mean you have to break up.
(muffled): So you think that I should... that I should ask Coach to move with me?
Okay, how about we put down the crackers?
I think she wants Coach to move to New York with her.
Oh! Yes, yes!
I mean...
Yeah? You-You... You think that he would say yeah?
Yeah. Definitely. He's crazy about you. He had a meltdown today in health class.
Now, the kids did learn that sex is emotionally complicated, so it was a good class, but trust me...
What Jess is trying to say here is that if you... if you really know how you feel about someone, you need to act now.
Wow. (laughs) Am I really doing this?
Yeah, but not before we clean your face,
'cause it's caked in snot.
Winston: Ooh, yeah, Coach!
Who you think he's gonna hook up with?
It's a tough Monday crowd. It...
It's nearly impossible to say, but I'm gonna go with the white bodysuit and, uh, the leopard print leggings.
She looks smart to me.
Winston: No way. No way. money's on the one with the wedding ring whose husband is clearly over there in the corner spying on her.
Yeah, he's not happy about that.
Oh, oh, ooh! Dora the Explorer just entered the scene (laughs)
You're tiny. I like it.
Nick: There she g... Oh! For the kiss!
Oh!
The winner, the winner.
Oh. May's here. Coach.
(grunting, growling)
(both whistling, grunting)
May here, she here.
Wh-Wha... Uh, May, wh-what are... what are you doing here?
No, come on.
No, no... ♪ In a flash ♪
♪ He is gone ♪
♪ It happened so soon... ♪
In case you were wondering, she, uh, she did get her little rubber holder thing.
Coach, um, I wanted to apologize.
Not now, honey.
He needs some time, honey.
I brought over a beer.
We'll take that beer.
Give us that beer, honey.
Sorry.
I'm not a freaking love doctor.
I'm Dr. E.D. Ote.
(chuckles) Dr. Idiot.
Yeah, I get it. I just never understood the whole love doctor thing, anyway.
I guess I was just hoping that with all the mistakes I've made, at least I could help you guys find love.
That I didn't go through all that for no reason.
Yeah, but no one has the answers, you know?
It's love, it makes no sense. It's messy.
There's no such thing as a love doctor.
You know what, Cece?
Go on your trip. Go get over Schmidt.
Don't listen to me.
I'm gonna climb that mountain.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
But I'm not gonna do it for Schmidt, I'm gonna do it for me.
Good. Go.
I love you, girl.
Love you, too.
Hey, don't smile. Don't smile. Look sadder that you're buying underpants. Underpants make you very, very sad.
Oh, I hate being here so much.
These underpants make me so uncomfortable.
That's perfect. There's that fat boy improv training.
Now, next, I'm going to ask for something with a little more coverage. You're gonna flip out, say you can't take it anymore, and leave the store. Then tomorrow we enter you into some kind of rehab facility.
When you get out we'll announce that we're getting married.
Married? What? I don't...
Shh. Yes. Shh. Yes, yes. Okay, so what I say is we build on this momentum, okay?
And we get married. I know it's not the most romantic idea in the world, but we'd be happy.
And then, we play our cards right, you and I are living in the mayor's mansion by 2020.
Fawn. Fawn.
No.
No? Oh, n-no to some of it?
No to all of it. We can't get married. I barely even know you.
You... You know me.
The real you, Fawn.
This is the real me.
I'm a politician, not in The vag*na Monologues.
I mean, what do you want?
I can get you anything you want.
You'll be rich, I'll be powerful.
I'm realizing... just now that it's not what I want.
I don't want any of that.
I want to be in love.
I want to be... I want to be crazy in love.
Okay, well, certainly don't quote Beyoncé and then pretend like you just thought of it.
Uh, uh, I want to be drunk in love.
But that's also a Beyoncé lyric.
Come on, Fawn.
You're not really in love with me.
I'm not really in love with-with you.
We just look great together buying underpants.
Are you breaking up with me?
I guess I kind of am.
Well, um...
I don't want this to come out the wrong way, but... does this mean I lose your vote?
(chuckles)
Never.
(camera shutters clicking)
(shouting): I just can't stand to be in here any longer!
Surrounded... by these underpants!
Red ones and yellow ones and blue ones and pink ones!
And this woman with her brassiere/teddy.
Underpants everywhere! They're driving me nuts!
I feel like I got underpants all over my body!
Schmidt out. This is ridiculous.
Enough is enough. Get out of here, paparazzi.
No, leave me... Get-get out of my way, sir.
I just want to say something.
No.
And then I'll leave.
Look, I'll never get involved in your personal life ever again.
Okay? Because I have no idea what I'm talking about.
And I know that now.
You could just... you could just troll for basic bitches at the juice bar, and I will say, mm, nothing.
Okay? So, look, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.
I do love her.
I'm crazy about her.
Yes! I was right!
(laughs) Love Doctor! I'm back.
Really? I thought it was just a regular break-up.
But in all fairness, I hadn't thought about it that hard.
I mean, what do I do, man?
You know, it's like she's going to New York.
Yup.
I can't go to New York with her. That's crazy.
You know? I like my sun on the right and my ocean on the left.
It's a rule of mine.
Plus, I'd have to leave you guys.
Can't leave you guys, I mean, I finally have a home.
All right, flash forward to the future.
40, 50 years.
You're married. Kids, grandkids.
Mm-hmm.
I'm long d*ad.
Naturally.
Of course.
And you look over to the woman sitting next to you.
And she's gray.
She's old.
She has that, like, grandma smell.
You have a grandpa smell, but you got...
Grandmas always smell like... like right when you open a cupboard.
Yeah, she has that smell, but...
Mm-hmm.
You love her.
Be honest with yourself.
Is that fat old lady sitting beside you...
Mm...
Honestly, right now, in my head, I'm just picturing, like, a beanbag chair with a wig on it.
Okay. We have gone too much into the description.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Is that May?
I think so.
Well, that's big.
Let's go get her.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
Let's go get May. - Yeah.
Hey, Jess, she texted me back! The blank bubble worked!
Guys?
Have you seen my white friends?
In 40 years, when we're old and Do it.
A mess of fat, loose skin hanging, I have boobs, and you've got hair on your face...
Holding my rock sack while I'm sitting on the toilet so it doesn't fall in the water.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, as you get older, your testicles lengthen.
(scoffs) No, what I'm saying is I love you.
Oh.
And that I would be a fool if I let you leave to New York without even fighting for us.
Ernie...
I love you, too, but I... I can't stay here.
I don't want you to stay here.
Um... look, I know we haven't been dating that long, and, um, this might seem crazy, but I was won...
Will you move to New York with me?
Yes! That! That's what I...
Yes?!
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do, yeah.
(screeches) Right. So, we're moving to New York?
We're moving to New York.
We're moving to New York.
Jersey City.
What?
Jersey City!
Jersey... I don't...
Nick: Well, this is all you, Jess.
Come on. This is all you.
I mean it. If Coach were hanging out with me, we'd be b*ating up a priest right now. (laughs)
You had a lot to do with this, too.
No, really. All that stuff about "Who do you see yourself next to?"
That's-that's really good.
Do you do that?
Who-who do you see yourself next to?
Winston mostly.
Ah. Yeah, me, too, actually.
(both laugh)
I just see a really old Winston.
(laughter)
Eating handfuls of birdseed out of the bag.
(both chuckle) He gets really into birds.
Hey!
Play some music! Play some music!
(playing upbeat, romantic classical music)
I'm sorry about Fawn.
Yeah. Sorry buddy.
Yeah, you guys were good together.
She was fine.
Okay, that's enough. I know you guys didn't like her.
Hated her guts.
So much...
Wait. What are we watching right now?
That girl just *** her boobs out Nick, why are you watching smut?
It was right there in the DVD player. I don't wanna get up and get it.
***
Who leaves p*rn on the DVD player.
I don't think we'll use it ***. Might as well just leave it in.
I'm sleeping on the couch. Fergusson and I are fighting.
***
It's a good story. Let's just watch and sees what happen.
What are you smiling at?
Nothing.
For crying out loud.
***
Jess. I have to see how the story ends.
There isn't any plot.
***
Okay, Schmidt, you ready for your feedback for the week?
Yes. Uh, let me just pull up my performance grid.
First off, thanks for keeping sex quick.
You were like a dog with an ice cream cone, and I loved it, but screaming "that's how Schmidty do" was not ideal.
Even though that's how Sch-Schmidty did?
Well, Schmidty did, and he did it good, but mommy doesn't want to hear how Schmidty's doing.
Note... note taken.
Okay. Great. Good.
Note taken.
I feel like I'm watching a p*rn set in an HR department.
You know, Fawn is teaching me how to be the most effective and successful man and lover I possibly can be.
Really? I thought you were fine before.
When you two were together? Which time?
The... the first time or the third time?
Because... 'cause you two were very off-and-on.
In a... in a very confusing way.
(laughs) I've had sex with him so many times.
We have a fun thing together, don't we?
Super fun, yeah. I really enjoy it.
What is her... what is it, Cecil?
What is your name?
You'll learn it. Don't worry.
Fawn's helping me see that I haven't reached my full potential yet.
Well, obviously, none of you have.
No, I have. I'm a cop.
And, as of yesterday, my mom no longer buys my plane tickets, so... (clicks tongue)
You need a ten-year plan.
Are you in a relationship that's headed towards marriage?
I am not currently, but I did go on a date with somebody named Charles last month.
She was a woman, but she was named after her uncle.
Well, Winston has no game.
Dude took a girl to a cement plant.
To see how rocks were made.
That's not where rocks are made.
And she loved it, then she abruptly moved away.
(groans)
Work sucked, my friends.
(nasally voice): Hear ye, hear ye.
Milady.
I dub you Sir Winston of the Roll of Egg.
(nasally): Ah, yes. Yes.
Who are you in this story?
I'm the jester.
I'm not gonna eat here anymore.
You'd think that the school board would want to give kids computers, but no, they just want to get reelected so they can keep dressing like Realtors from the 1980s.
Solid municipal burn, Jessica.
Fawn... Councilwoman.
Councilwoman... do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?
Oh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.
I'll put a word in with Yowtz.
Martha Yowtz?
Yeah.
The lioness of Los Angeles education?
Yes.
The straw that stirs the school board's drink?
That's right.
That is a woman I'd like to get to know.
Is there any way I could come with you to this event?
Ah, you know, it's really a networking thing.
Well, that's perfect, 'cause I'd love to network her.
With her. It's "with..."
You network with her.
Yeah, it's "network with her," and you don't really strike me as the "networking" type.
You're more of a "follow a butterfly around for a day" kind of gal.
Oh, sister, I'm a middle-school vice principal.
You think I got this job without knowing how to network?
Most likely. Yes.
I got an office with a door, bub.
Pencil me in. I'll yak with Yowtz.
The press will be there, and I could use a photo with an educator, so... okay.
Oh, great.
Oh. Hey.
Do you still need me for the photo op?
I will need you there, actually.
I'm trying to become more accessible on social media.
Speaking of which, is there some way you can make your skin look less white in photos?
People are saying that you're haunting me.
I can do that. Absolutely. 100%.
Let me just make a note.
Wonderful.
And, Jess, the event tomorrow is at a golf course.
Do you golf?
Does a bear eat with his hands? (chuckles)
I don't know.
I'll be there.
Great.
So I say to her, "Water? I barely even know you."
Stop talking to me like we're in the middle of a conversation.
We just sat down.
All right.
I hate when you do that.
Okay.
Winston.
That is a beautiful girl right there. Wow.
Just say something to her.
Yeah, just say something to her.
Shawty, what that thang do?
No.
What was that?
Winston: Dude, I think it's a nervous tic that stems from my lack of self-confidence.
We got to help. I can't watch this.
Excuse me, miss? Hi.
Coach, stop.
Um, this is my buddy, Winston.
Um... I don't know what he's doing with his mouth.
That's not his normal smile at all.
I'm gonna fix that. If I could just...
Both sides... even it out.
Better.
I think he likes you.
Oh, yeah?
Just go talk to her. You got it.
I don't...
Okay, okay, I'm going.
You got it. You got it. - He's coming.
He's excited to talk to you. Hey... My friends.
(laughter)
Hello.
I'm Winston Bishop.
Winston Bishop. KC.
KC! Just be like, "Yo, KC, where JoJo at?"
In rehab, probably.
He's... he was on drugs.
Yeah.
Winston: Sorry. Um...
I don't know what to say right now.
Uh, kind of bl*wing this, huh?
Uh...
Um, I think you're very beautiful, KC, and I would like to see you again soon... like, later today for lunch?
I'd love to.
Really?
Here.
Oh.
I'm gonna put in my number... or come with me to this thing in the park I'm going to now and we can grab something after.
You know, I saw Nick Nolte in the park once.
And I was like, "Yo, Nick Nolte, what you doing in the park?"
And he was just like, "I'm just hanging out."
Yeah, so I thought that was notable.
I'm going to a rally to protest the police.
Do you want to come?
Or we could just do lunch.
Let's do lunch.
Okay.
Yeah. Nice to... nice to meet you, KC.
Cece: Fawn is none of my business, and Schmidt seems to really like her, so whatever happens, I'm just not getting involved.
Then why are you on your way to hang out with him?
What are you doing?
He said to come over.
He said it was an emergency.
What if he does something sexy?
That's like Gollum hanging out with the One Ring.
It'll be fine.
Ooh. Hey, Cece, I'm glad you're here.
I need you to put bronzer all over my body.
None of the guys are here, and they also refused to do it.
Um, all over. I know you're giving me a look, but, really, like, all over.
All the cracks, the crevices.
The engine, the caboose, everything.
Oh, okay.
Gripped it and ripped it.
You da man.
No, say, "Fawn is the man."
Fawn's the man. Fawn's the man.
Oh, hey, there's Yowtz.
Woman's got more connections than a flight from Burbank to Sri Lanka.
Well, then, it's a good thing I bought the airport neck pillow in the gift shop, because... (chuckles)
You know what that means.
I got this.
Okay.
How the hell are you?
Jessica Day.
I need 20 computers for my school.
Just met you, but noted.
You're up.
Thanks.
What? Oh.
You walk towards the...
Whoops.
Oh, dear Lord.
Why are we putting this on your body?
Aren't you going to be wearing a shirt?
Well, you know, Fawn wants me to be prepared for all scenarios.
What if somebody gives birth out there and I have to swaddle the baby in my polo?
(wry chuckle) Yeah...
I've never been under this kind of scrutiny before.
I'm having my teeth shaved by a 25th of an inch.
Fawn thinks that I have the teeth of an immigrant.
She says every time she looks at me, all she can see is Fievel Mouskewitz singing "There Are No Cats in America."
Those little... those little mice Jews.
I mean, what do you think, Cece?
You... you like Fawn, right?
Yeah, I mean, as-as long as you're happy.
There you go.
What the hell?
What?
Why am I sparkly?
Sparkly?!
You bought the bronzer with glitter in it.
Cece, please, you gotta help me, Ce...
Fawn's gonna k*ll me!
Okay, just don't get too pressive. You'll crease!
So stupid! I feel like I'm trying to get into an 18-and-under club in Tucson!
So, yeah, at the rally, the was this kid I know from the youth center who was arrested last week because he "fit a description."
I mean, he's 14... he doesn't even fit into his jeans.
(uncomfortable laughter)
Yeah.
Anyways... enough about me. Let's, uh, talk about you.
What do you do?
What do I do?
Um... okay.
Well... what do I do?
Um...
Okay, the truth is...
Hey, man.
You know them?
Oh, not personally, no.
Hey, what's up, Bishop?
Oh, yeah, I do know them.
We went to school together.
See you at work, bud.
More importantly... we work together.
You're a cop?
Me? (laughs)
A cop? No!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't...
No, no, no. Get that out of your head.
Uh, what I do is I'm a... male stripper.
A stripper?
That's why they were wearing the uniforms.
Yeah, I see where you... why you would think that. No.
A surprising amount of day work for a stripper.
You know, we just go in there, we do our routine while they eat their lunch salads.
Wow. (laughs)
You just pray nobody orders soup.
Lost a lot of good men to soup.
(short laugh) It's hard to gauge temperature when you're just... dipping and running.
You'd be surprised what you could replace a ladle with.
Nice day.
Beautiful.
What happened to the top of my hat?
You take it?
(laughs) A little, uh... little visor humor.
Give me back my hat!
I'm kidding. (chuckles)
I wasn't gonna h*t you.
I'm just joshing.
Just Joshua, Joshua, joshing...
Do you ladies want to join my network?
Uh, you ladies can just go ahead and play through.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you later.
Uh, so, how-how do you feel that the networking is going?
Pretty good.
I would call it, like, a solid B.
It's a cruise ship disaster.
Look, Jess, if you want those computers, we have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it.
Shake my hand.
Gross.
What is your name?
Jess?
You have the confidence of a child that was raised in a basement.
Say it with pride, and include your job title like it's the second half of your name.
Like this... Fawn Moscato, City Council.
Jessica Day, Vice Principal!
How the heck are you?
Dawn: Lighten it up with a quick joke whenever possible.
Nice shoes.
Look like you chopped off Big Bird's feet, you m*rder. (laughs)
Fawn: And try not to make jokes about m*rder
Sesame Street puppets if you can.
Jess: Good note.
Fawn:  Now, tell me...
Are you wearing underwear?
Oh, yeah. Big-time.
Lose them. I never wear underwear in networking scenarios.
Gives you a secret; an edge.
Besides, I firmly believe that power emanates from the vag*na.
So, why block it?
It's not the only thing that emanates.
What does that mean?
(quietly): Other stuff.
So I said, "Tammy, are we playing golf, or are we making sand castles?"
(laughter)
Tammy is the worst.
She told my kid to shut up once. I nearly punched her.
I don't want to start talking business while we still have a whole tournament to play, but...
I'd love to connect about your ideas in the clubhouse.
Let's meet up there when we're all done.
Great. I'll see you in there, Marty.
May I call you Marty?
Oh, I'd prefer it.
(laughs)
The clubhouse?
That is where you close the deal.
You are in, my friend.
Now, let's finish up this game.
No problem.
Write a six and let's go. They should start putting GPS in golf b*lls, am I right?
We already got lapped by Sue Kim from the Korean Women's League, and she's 100.
Jess, she is literally 100 years old.
And I'm... I'll tell you what...
Not a young 100.
Martha doesn't strike me as the type of person who gives computers to cheaters.
You really don't understand how networking works.
The computers are just the thing you talk about when you're really talking about how to help each other become more powerful.
Just like the money for this golf thing... it doesn't go to charity. It just pays for the event where we network.
Isn't that cool?
Yay, America.
Were the computers ever really on the table?
You're still talking about the computers?
Okay. Uh, no. No. No money for computers.
I should've never listened to you. I also should have never removed my underwear, because now it's drafty and I feel vulnerable to wildlife.
Are your underwear sticking out of your pocket?
Are those boys' underwear?
They're unisex. None of your business.
Look, will you forget the ball? Or none of these women are ever going to invite you to play golf again.
Well, I don't want to play golf with these women again.
I don't want any part of this.
If I can't have the computers, I will... I will stay here and I will play a clean game of golf.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Fawn, I need to go find my ball.
Like an honest person.
Okay.
Oh, look... it's a baby bird.
No, it's a d*ad baby bird.
I need to move on before I get emotional.
Can't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.
With everything that's been going on, I just...
I feel like she wouldn't respect me.
You want to know what I think?
No, Nick, I don't.
This is something you can't understand.
Because I'm not black?
Uh...
What, because I don't work for NASA, I can't fix a rocket ship?
If you don't work at NASA, they're not gonna just let you walk off the street and fix a rocket ship.
You're missing my point.
Besides, you lost your right to talk to me about race during the O.J. trial.
Is in the white Bronco...
Why does it have to be a "white" Bronco?
Why not just a Bronco?
I can talk to you about this.
I mean, we grew up together.
We went to the same schools, we watched the same shows, we listened to the same records.
Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and bitch chew like this. (grunts, laughs)
Hercules.
Was that your Eddie Murphy?
That's Eddie Murphy.
That was so bad, it wasn't even offensive.
I said "Hercules," and everyone associates that with Eddie Murphy.
Whenever you do your impressions, it makes me super uncomfortable.
Fine. You know what? You want to do this?
You and me are gonna get weird about race?
Do your Seinfeld.
Come... Nick, that's not...
Do your Seinfeld.
What's the deal with bananas?
I mean, they got orange juice, you got apple juice, where's the banana juice?
(laughs): I never thought of that.
Ah, boy.
'Cause you got orange juice, you...
I love you, but you're white, I'm black.
I understand where she's coming from.
When I was a kid, we used to run from the police.
Even if we did nothing wrong, it was just out of habit.
Why haven't you ever told me?
Coach: 'Cause you'll never get it.
How long have you been standing there?
Uh, right around, "Your mama got a mouth on the back of her neck, and the bitch chew like this."
Now, that's Eddie!
I don't see the difference.
(laughs): Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!
He's doing the laugh!
That's what I was doing.
(imitating Eddie Murphy's laugh)
Stop, Nick.
I honestly don't see the difference.
As the only other black man in this loft, I feel like I should weigh in.
This issue really hits home with me, and I feel like I have a lot of thoughts and ideas that I need to get off my chest.
Thank you, Coach.
But I'm hungry.
Man.
I skipped breakfast, and lunch is gonna be dumb as hell.
♪ Race talk snacks ♪
♪ Race talk snacks, gotta get me ♪
♪ Some race talk snacks ♪
♪ Gonna be super uncomfortable! ♪
So, KC...
Shh...
I just feel like...
Can't-can't weigh in.
I know, but I...
Can't weigh in.
I do have something I want to say that's not a race...
Shh, don't.
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
I'm a good guy; that's all that matters.
That's what I was gonna say.
I want to make this... No, no, no.
Shut it down, Nick.
Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and she chews like this.
Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.
So the good news is you can't see the glitter anymore. Great.
Well, what's the bad news?
You look like, um... can't exactly put my finger on it.
I look like the d*ad body the police pull out of a lake.
That's how you describe it; you look d*ad.
I don't want to look like a d*ad boy.
I want to look like a living boy.
Why are you calling yourself a boy?
Because I'm freaking out!
(phone vibrating) Freaking...
Freaking out. Oh, no.
It's-it's Fawn.
(sighs)
Hey, Faw... hey, Fawn.
What the Jewish God did you do?
In an attempt to look less ghost-like, I put on some bronzer, but the bronzer had glitter in it, and now...
You look like a wood carving of yourself.
The press is here.
And single women have proven to be less appealing to voters.
Fix it and get here now.
I am Fawn Moscato, and I will not miss a photo opportunity!
Faw... Oh.
Fawn?
How about a fake beard?
Get some double-sided tape, we can shave Winston's cat...
Okay, you know what, enough.
I cannot just stand here and watch Fawn treat you like she's your pageant mom.
She needs to accept you exactly how you are, or you need to find somebody that will.
'Cause I think you are fine as is.
Damn it.
You know what, you're right. I'm gonna go talk to her.
Can you drive though? I want to fix my makeup in the car.
For me, not for her.
I don't want to scare anybody. Ugh.
I think I'm drunk from my face fumes.
I've never seen so many strokes taken on a single hole in all of my life.
This has got to be some kind of record.
Do you care to comment?
Hey!
Not bad! Look at her go!
The hole's behind you.
Thanks, Marty.
172!
Par was five.
I know, Marty.
You're the worst golfer I've ever seen.
Look, I don't care if I look stupid.
I didn't come here to climb the ladder.
The only reason why I came here was to get computers for my students.
And that's the only reason why I came: for the school.
I respect that.
I'll get you those computers.
Really?!
Yes, I will.
In 2018, when the district is fiscally solvent.
I'll... take that as a victory.
I support Vice Principal Day.
It is education that will bring water back to this city and will rebuild the middle class...
Don't let me back down.
Don't worry, I will not.
You look... so crazy right now.
You look like a doll boy.
A doll man.
I'm a d... I'm a doll man.
A doll man who's about to get his dignity back.
Let's b*at China!
I'm Fawn Moscato! (chuckles)
Oh!
(crowd cheers) Oh.
(laughs): I can't believe it.
Now, this ball is a symbol...
(crowd gasps)
(laughter) of the unity...
Man: Wow!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn.
What? What's going on?
You're not wearing any, uh...
Each one's like a snowflake.
What do you mean there's a meme?
It speaks?
Well, what does it say?
Oh, well, that is just crass.
Yes, I know I wanted a more accessible Web pr...
Will you stop laughing, Lou?
You're a father!
You're my father!
(gasps)
Oh, no, no, it's... it's carpet cleaner.
You know, I thought I'd take it right down to the base.
I'll probably have to regrow some skin, but it's all right.
It's okay, Schmidt.
Look, I understand if you want to break up with me.
I'm a laughingstock, and you shouldn't be associated with my brand.
Which is tainted.
An unfortunate choice of words.
So, what was it you wanted to say to me?
Fawn, I don't want to break up with you.
I like you just the way that you are.
No offense, but you're terrifying to look at, and you smell like a chemical f*re.
Taint that the truth?
Yeah.
Did you see what I did there?
I just...'Cause you did it, then I...
It was too... too soon. It's too soon.
I wanted you to feel good about when you said it though.
Okay.
KC?
So... um... this is the real me.
I'm proud of what I do, I really am.
I work with a lot of great people, and I want to be one of them.
Plus, if there are ever Ghostbusters, I know they're gonna recruit from law enforcement first.
I know you're mad at me.
I just came to say that.
I'm not mad that you're a cop.
I'm mad that you lied.
Well, tell you what, uh, is there any way I could take you out again and, you know, uh, be so honest with you that it scares the hell out of you?
I don't know.
That uniform is kind of distracting, isn't it?
Maybe you should... take it off.
(laughs)
You lied and said you were a stripper; it seems like the fair thing to do.
(dance music playing)
Just in front of all these people?
In front of your colleagues? (man whoops)
Oh, okay. I hear some "whoos!"
(whoops)
You ain't got no Ginuwine or nothing?
Seriously though, I'm...
I'm... I really am a police officer.
I can't really be here stripping for you...
It's a clip-on ladies.
And it's on the ground.
Here we go. Uh-huh, I want y'all to get y'all ones ready.
I wear my underwear two sizes too big.
This is a... This is a thing. This is a thing I gotta do in order to get my belt off.
Ugh! Can you believe this guy?
Pete is over an hour late for our brunch date.
Pete? Who's Pete?
Oh, it's this dude who goes to my gym.
Thought Jess could use a man with a little muscle for a change, so I set 'em up.
Not gonna marry him, but I'm having fun.
(chuckles) Knock, knock. Who's there?
Orange. Hang on a second, Orange.
I'm gonna send a sext to Pete, which I did.
My first one ever. Want to see? It's super hot.
I don't want to, uh...
Okay, that's just a picture of you in a bra over a T-shirt Holding a sign that says "Property of Pete."
Not a sext.
I'm wearing a bra!
No, that's like a glorified selfie.
You can see the bra.
Nope.
(scoffs) I bet he saw this, and he was like, (in low voice): "Oh, delicious."
You want him to say that?
I have to agree, (phone blipping) because the true nature of eroticism is what is not shown.
Coach: I never get sexts.
What are you taking?
Just some, uh... motion sickness pill.
It's a mild sedative.
My mom just landed.
That's unrelated.
Oh, my God, your mom's here?!
I'm so excited to meet her.
You probably won't; she's busy.
But maybe, hopefully, I doubt it.
I can't believe I've never met her.
You know, we get together and we laugh and...
(sighs) she tells me all the ways that I could be better at things, and then I do them, but not right.
Oh, it's fun.
We have, we have fun.
You know, I wish I had fun with my partner.
Wow, every time I ask Aly to hang out, she's always like, "Nah."
Nick: Hey, Schmidty, vamos.
I want to show you a surprise investment opportunity.
Surprise, Nick? I'm telling you right now, if it is a boat, I'm gonna be so psyched!
I literally jut got new boat shoes.
Jess: (sputters) Standing here like a damn jabroni.
He hasn't even answered any of my texts.
He hasn't?
You don't think he's...
(gasping) He is bl*wing you off!
He best not be!
Hell no!
You guys are getting riled up, huh?
We are gonna march right over there, and we all right gonna find out what's happening!
Let's go.
(door closes) (groans)
Turns out that Pete had a very good excuse for not showing up.
He d*ed.
What?
Winston: ♪ Just got out of the shower ♪
♪ Guess who cleaned everything? ♪
♪ Guess who got in deep? ♪
What?
A motorcycle accident? I didn't even know Pete rode one.
He didn't. Apparently, he was thinking about getting one, and he slipped and fell on the showroom floor.
Buffed floors... beautiful, but at what cost?
The first guy I sext dies.
I should go to the memorial, right?
Jess, don't make this about yourself, all right?
You went on two dates with the guy.
I was one of the last people to text him.
On Earth.
Cece: Look, you didn't even have sex with him, okay? You're fine.
So if I'd slept with him, I'd go.
Or if you'd gone skiing together.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
What are these rules?
Coach: Just don't go.
'Cause if you go, then I'm gonna feel weird about not going, and I ain't going.
Yeah, just come and have a mani-pedi with me.
I'm going; it's the right thing to do.
Oh, so if I don't go, I'm a bad person now?
Cece.
Mm-hmm.
I'm surprised. I thought you, of all people, would want to accompany your best friend to the funeral of a guy she texted, but...
I guess... not.
♪ Ta-da! ♪
What do you mean?
What is ta-da? We drove here together and parked before you covered my eyes.
What is the surprise investment, Nick?
The bar.
Mike's selling us ten percent.
I really need the cash.
I got swindled by a young gay roller skater.
A rink twink.
I know what a rink twink is, Mike.
Hey, 20 thou and we are part owners, okay?
I've done my research.
There's a consistent revenue and no startup costs.
You're really serious about this, huh?
I really want this, man.
Good. I want this, too.
Good.
Where are we gonna get 20 grand from?
Well, we got the ten grand we made on the Swuit.
Maybe do we have any rich friends we can borrow money from?
Well, let's think about it. There's the middle school vice principal, there's the cop, the gym teacher.
Let's not forget about the community college student.
Whew, lot of options.
Yeah.
It's tough, it's frustrating.
Yeah, huh... damn it.
Schimdty just had an idea. I know that face.
Give it to me, give it to me.
What are you thinking, big cat?
What are you thinking, big cat?
I just...
(grunts) Think, now, if we own it, don't be kicking it.
Just... Yeah, oh.
Aah!
Ouch.
Okay.
Hey, pal, uh, what's happening?
My mom still owes me my bar miztvah money.
I mean, we can ask her, but, you know, she's...
Pushy, overbearing, controlling.
So, what?
Oh, she's a typical Jewish mom?
It's anti-Semitic when you say it like that.
So-so what, she likes to get involved?
That's great, you know.
I don't feel very comfortable when I'm around her.
Well, boo-hoo, she thinks you want to have sex with her.
Try learning about the birds and the bees from her using a doughnut and a banana. By the way, neither one of which are used for what you think they are.
How could that be?
Hey, want to grab a bite later?
You know it, partner. (laughs)
Hey, Aly, uh, want to grab a beer after work?
Ooh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
(groaning)
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba.
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.
Ooh.
(humming)
(grunting)
(clicking tongue)
Uh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
No.
Oh, come on.
Not work related, not interested, Bishop.
We're professionals, not friends.
Oh God, here we go. Showtime.
Mama!
No!
I was meeting my little boy, not this handsome movie star.
What are you doing with these?
Why would you hide your hazels?
(laughs) Hi, sweetheart.
Oh!
Hey, Louise, it's really good to see you.
I bet it is; tape it down, Miller.
Tape it?
Here, look at your baby brother.
How handsome is Reggie?
(kisses) Give him a kiss.
Kiss your brother. Give him a kiss.
Give him a kiss; he loves it. Kiss him, kiss him.
Okay, give him a scratch. He loves a scratch.
He loves a scratch.
Can I get an alcohol?
So, how's Susan?
Susan's my-my mom's work friend who she lives with.
Susan cuts her own firewood.
Susan's my girlfriend.
That's what I said, your work friend.
She's good. We just got a new mattress.
So work's been more comfortable.
(chuckling)
What?
What-what now?
Is it my sweater? Is it too dark?
It might be. Here.
You got, you got me a sweater?
Mm-hmm. Now that's nice.
That's nice. Try it on.
I'm trying, I'm put-putting it on right now.
It goes over your head.
He's putting a sweater on a sweater?
Get over it. Get over it.
That's nice, very nice.
Thank you so much. I love this so much.
Schmidt, isn't there something you want to ask your mother about?
Schmidt: Well, I did... I did want to ask you about...
Your voice is wavering.
Here, have some chocolate.
No, Mom, I'm okay. Thank you.
Have it.
Here, have it, have it, have it.
I'll just have one.
Have it, have it.
Have it, have it.
There you go. I do love it. Hmm!
So, I... What I was thinking about was... uh... my bar mitzvah money.
Can I have it?
Oh, my God! Of course you can! Yes.
Oh, that was... yeah, so easy.
As soon as you write your thank-you notes.
You didn't forget, did you?
He never did his thank-you cards.
Schmidt: Mom, I just thought that you know, that was so long ago...
Well, you know.
If I just gave you the money, what kind of lesson would that be?
You finish your cards, you get the money.
That's fair, isn't it?
You didn't finish your thank-you cards?
There's a hat in the bag, too. Try it on.
Put it on.
That's very nice.
Take it off, you're in a restaurant.
Sure about this? It's not too late to bail.
We're going.
It's the right thing to do.
Look, we'll be in and out of there in five minutes.
It'll be so packed, no one will notice.
(whispering): The right thing to do.
Is it?
And uh... Pete said...
"If you gotta puke, Duffy, just puke."
Almost time to tell the story about your close friend Pete.
I'm just gonna tell the truth.
We went on a few dates. That's it.
I'm Val, Pete's girlfriend.
(sobs) I'm sorry.
Would you mind going?
How did you know Pete?
(clears throat quietly)
Um, from work.
We worked together.
You're a sports agent, too?
Wow...
Yep.
Okay, we got a lot of thank-you cards to write and not a lot of time.
Let's get into it. I'll start, okay?
Let's go, here we go.
"To whom it may concern..."
To... to whom it may concern?
I'm on a vibe.
Nick, these need to have personal details.
My mom is gonna check them.
All right, then get me the guest list.
Where have you imagined that I've been holding onto the guest list for all these years?
Just carrying it around in my wallet? This is impossible.
This is gonna take some serious detective work.
(chuckles)
It's a good thing I can call backup.
Hey.
You said this was a work thing.
It is a work thing.
It's a... work-style thing.
You see, we need your skills to solve a cold case.

Aly: Hey, you want your bar mitzvah money? Tell me her name.
I don't remember.
I don't believe you!
Just relax. Relax. Here, Schmidt.
Sip that.
Want to hear the music again?
(hip-hop music playing)
All right, there we go.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, you're 13 years old, everybody's feeling it...

What was her name?!
Sharon Rosenberg!
Okay. 257 Sea Cove Drive, 11021.
Okay. "Dear Mrs. Rosenberg...
Thank you for the check."
I need a personal detail!
Personal detail!
She had a pool.
"Cannonball!
Love, Schmidt."
Winston: Cannonball!
Okay, Schmidt. All right, Schmidt.
Who's this guy?
Schmidt: I don't know, Winston.
It's too far away, I can't tell.
Uh... enhance, enhance, enhance...
Okay, too far, too far.
Dehance, dehance.
Scott Rubenstein!
Scott Rubenstein.
My mom's CPA.
Scott Rubenstein... deceased.
Yes!
Yes!
Love the d*ad ones.
You know, Pete wasn't just a sports agent.
He understood sports.
Like, he knew the rules, all of them: offsides, unnecessary bumping, what happens if you h*t a bird with the ball you throw...
Excuse-excuse me.
Can I, uh, borrow her for a second?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
What's up?
Uh... what the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to save that poor girl's feelings.
If she knew the truth, it would shatter her.
I am going to the nail salon, okay?
Bye.
Cece... - I'm out.
Hey, wait! Guys, wait.
No, stop... guys.
The only sport I know is Ricky Ball, and I'm pretty sure my friend Ricky made that up.
No. Lying about who you are is not the right thing to do.
I am going.
Coach...
(whimpering) Is this, uh... is this Pete's thing? He was my agent.
Of course he was.
Who else would represent NFL star J.J. Watt?
Uh, Pete was my best friend and, uh...
God, it's good to see you.
Louise: Wouldn't the couch be better over there? All that light?
Or do you like to live like a radish, underground?
So we worked really hard on the... on the cards.
Let's see what we got.
Okay.
But you know what would be better?
Connie's into gardening.
You should mention that.
And if you really want your card to pop, you can use a nice fountain pen on silver stationery.
And you should sign your full name, not just Schmidt.
I mean, you have a lovely first name.
Great! I'll just make all those changes, Mom!
(door slams) Okay.
You're not getting me into your pants, you little jackhammer.
Oh, I don't want you in my pants, Louise.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
So then Pete says to...
Allen Iverson.
"...you want to keep sportsing on the... "
Grizzlies.
Jess: "...but if you want me to show you the money, then... You gotta finish your career off with the '76ers!"
(chuckles) And it was classic Pete.
It's so nice to remember work as more than just a thing that kept Pete on the phone all the time.
You're very welcome.
Oh, Val, you should have Pete's phone.
All those memories and photos...
It's in the garage with all his stuff.
I'll give it to you before you go.
Val: Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, we gotta find that phone before Val sees the sext.
Yes, it is the right thing to do.
Like I've said all along. I got a good thing going with J.J. and I'm not gonna let you ruin it.
That's the funeral spirit.
What are you guys doing in here?
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for Pete's phone.
So are we! Did you sext him, too?
No. I fired Pete over text, so I didn't want to crush his family.
That's why I'm at the memorial.
Not because it was the right thing to do?
No. No. I mean, we never even went skiing.
Who makes up these rules?
Now...
What are you guys doing out here?
Um...
Singing.
S... What?
We like to sing.
Together. About...
Sports.
Food.
Sports foods.
Val: That's fun.
It's...
Would you guys...
Would it be putting you on the spot if I asked you to do one?
I think that wouldn't be appropriate.

That work-style thing was pretty fun.
Let's parlay that into a beer.
My buddy has a bar he works at, down the street.
It's carpeted, so...
Bishop, what don't you get?
No.
(SUV door opens, shuts)
(engine starts)
Are you okay?
Oh, hey, man. Thanks.
Yeah, I don't know, man. It's just...

Hey, bud.
Hard candy?
Is it butterscotch?
No, 'cause we're friggin' strangers.
(laughs): "Is it butterscotch?"
So, you freaked out a little back there, didn't you?
Not to use some Popsicle psychology...
"Popsicle psychology"?
Yeah, it's pop psychology for short.
'Cause, you know, you eat the Popsicle and you love it so much and then you're stuck holding the-the stick?
You get it. you get it.
Not really, but...
I think you have some pent-up resentment towards your mom.
She's trying to control you!
She treats you like a little baby who can't do anything for himself.
That's why I never wrote the cards in the first place.
Go tell that to your mom!
She'll understand.
I don't understand.
The couch looks good here though, doesn't it?
It opens up the whole room.
Louise, I think what your boy is trying to say is...
Shut it, Nick.
Honey, why do you hang out with him?
You know Nancy Borkow? Her son just moved to L.A.
He wrote a movie script for the movies.
I can connect you. You need better friends!
Enough, Mom!
You don't get to choose my friends!
You don't get to choose anything!
Because this is my life!

And we don't need any of your money.
Whoa, we're all being very emotional.
Let's just slow everything...
I'm moving the couch back!
Gosh!
Did you nail that thing down?
That's... You move that all by yourself?
I'm an adult man, Mom.
And Nick is my best friend in the whole wide world.
And we're gonna buy a small portion of that bar without any of your help.

(screams) Aah!
Shucks!
Sorry!
I thought I saw Pete's ghost!
It was a paint can. (laughs)
(all chuckle) Are you sure about...?
Ugh! We gotta find this phone.
And get the hell out of here.
Okay, it's ringing.
Can anybody hear it?
(cell phone ringing) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
There's another box.
What the hell...? "Property of Pete"?
He made my sext his called I.D.?
This is a sext?
JJ fired him over text!
After the day I had, I needed this.
Me, too.
What happened?
I know you were talking to yourself.
Now you're talking to a stranger.
Get over it.
Is that a crime in California? What happened?
I got dragged to a random dude's funeral.
Who dragged you? My friend. She always thinks she knows what's best.
Who's your friend... me? (both laugh)
No.
I got accused of that today by my son.
He's tired of me babying him.
But he's my baby, so what am I supposed to do?
Maybe you have to let go a little.
This is why strangers talk.
You're a genius.
Want to see a picture of my son? He's handsome.
Nah. I'm kind of in love with my ex, so...
All right, you can't date him anyway.
You're not Jewish, so over my d*ad body and all that.
(laughs)
(laughs)
Today was not a win for me.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't even know what that means.
Well, you made today about yourself.
Mm.
Not to use popcorn psychology, but it's human nature.
You know? Soon as I saw JJ walk in, I was, like, "JJ Watt, be my best friend."
(both chuckle)
(sighs)
I got to do something.
Should I tell Aly off? Uh... put in for a new partner?
What's the right thing to do here?
I can say with 100% certainty I have no idea.
Look at you. I'm proud of you.
I learned from the best.
That's awesome.
What a wonderful moment we're having today!
You know what? I'll figure it out myself.
Thank you.
This is from that sixth grader over there.
(quietly): Hmm?
Aly, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to explain. Look...
I hung out a lot with my last partner.
And we got close and...
You sh*t him?
What?
He d*ed?
No.
Oh, my goodness... is he...?
Did he survive?
What are you talking about?
How did you partner die?
He didn't die!
So, what's your point?
He just fell in love with me!
Oh... oh! Oh!
Yeah.
Ooh...
And it messed everything up.
And I just don't want that to happen again.
Damn, you're conceited!
Don't nobody want your babies.
I know that now!
I mean, you brought me to your loft and showed me a bar mitzvah video.
Friends?
Cool, cool.
Just, uh... don't go falling in love with me.
'Cause I'm lovable as hell.
Okay.
I think I'll be okay.
All right.
Another!
(whoops)
Oh, my.
Michael... we'd like to buy your share of the bar.
And although we don't have the full $20,000 at the present...
You don't have the money? No.
But we're the right guys.
No, the right guys would have the money.
Or Kieran Culkin's mouth.
How about Owen Wilson's nose?
(groans)
Mom?
Oh, my God!
Schmidt, is this your mom?
Hi. I've heard so much about you.
How's Long Island?
Any cute Schmidt stories?
I need less from you.
Okay.
I met a Mexican woman at the nail salon... who made me realize...
I need to let go.
You're a man.
And you deserve your bar mitzvah money.
Thanks, Mom.
Mike, we want to buy your ten percent of the bar.
This bar?!
There's a dying catfish laying on the sidewalk out front!
This would be a hilarious time for me to back out... but okay.
Yes! We're part owners!
Both (chanting): We're part owners!
How great this moment?
I just think you'd be more of a success socially if you let people come to you.
You know what's fun?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we're best friends.
(groans)
Jess: Nick, can you believe it?
You're a bar owner.
I'm so proud of you.
None of this would've happened without Schmidt standing up to his mom.
It was so scary.
I can't believe I missed her.
We still can use the other 90% of the bar, right?
Yeah You know, that's not how it works.
It's just this is my favorite section. I wanted to...
It's a financial share.
To Schmidt's mom. I do want to have sex with her.
(Shouting) Nick.
Nick: Your hair looks so different.
Well, get used to it, boys.
'Cause we're single, we're sophisticated.
And we just went to a place to get blow-outs.
What's a blow-out?
You know how it's possible to make your own hair look amazing?
Uh, I do not.
Yeah, you know whose hair I admire?
Jesus. Man, dude's hair get overlooked because of all the miracles and stuff.
So, there's a place that just bl*ws out your hair?
Well, they wash it first.
So, essentially they create a problem, and then charge you to fix it.
Here's a, a business idea I just thought of.
Why don't I break the heels off your shoe, and then charge you to glue them back on?
Or, uh, take your sore back and adjust it.
Which would, uh, just make me a chiropractor.
You ladies need to be very careful.
Blow-out can give a woman too much confidence.
Make them take on things that they can't handle.
Hillary Clinton.
Oh, hey, Ken. You can just put the beer behind the bar.
Oh, actually I was coming over here to talk to the pretty ladies.
(both laugh)
Nice hair.
(both laugh)
(laughs) Hey, Jess.
Hey, Cece.
Bear Claw, hello.
I'd offer you my hand, but it's quite wet.
Still standing close to people.
My building has cable Internet now.
Did you get even prettier?
(laughs): What?
No.
What? No.
What... no.
You and Cece should come to a party at our place tonight.
I live with Ken.
Ken played football in college.
Do a football thing, Ken!
I'm kidding, Ken.
Nobody wants to see that garbage.
Anyway, gonna be some cool people there.
We know twin architects.
Yeah, they're... brothers.
Ken, what did we talk about?!
Huh?
Some people understand things that don't come quite naturally to your brain!
Stupid dum-dum.
Stay out of this. You guys want to come?
Um, could you excuse us for a second?
Yeah.
You played that all wrong, you stupid idiot.
Cece, I know these guys are weird, but parties have cute guys who aren't Schmidt.
What did Charisma say while he was washing our hair?
He said he was worried about Taylor Swift living in New York all alone.
Well, yeah, we all are, but he also said that we need to embrace our freedom.
We're single. We can do whatever we want!
The only thing stopping us is us.
And Charisma made us promise not to waste these blow-outs.
Our hair does look so good right now.
Let's do this! Let's go to this party!
Let's see where this journey takes us!
(birds chirping)
Good morning.
Hi.
Do you want to hear a funny story?
This green pillow over here, I always use it in between my legs like a... like a second person.
But it found its proper home underneath your head today.
(both laugh)
Man: Hey, hey... mamma Mia!
He slipped in the sauce. Bookmark this one.
Coach, get in here! We're watching videos of Italians falling down.
Oh, he's on a jog with May. You know, I think he might've met his match with that one.
Rumor has it they haven't even kissed yet.
What was all that noise in their room if they haven't kissed yet?
That's weird.
Stop listening by everybody's rooms for sex sounds, Winston. (laughs)
Listen, if I'm not getting it, Hey! Hey!
I want to make sure everybody else is getting it.
Winston, I mean it, man.
Good morning!
I, uh, I believe you all know May.
Hi.
If you'd like to exchange pleasantries, please do so now, as she as on her way out.
Why are you talking like you're high and I'm your dad?
Sorry I can't stay. I'm performing at a benefit today.
Oh. I'm playing Bach's "Cello Suite No. 1," and all I have left to learn is the cadenza movement, so it's...
Well, at least it's not the saraband.
Oh! Oh, my God! (laughing)
Right? I get this.
That's crazy.
Hey, you guys should come.
Yeah, it's at an art gallery.
Yeah, yeah. I-I think I speak for everyone when I say absolutmont.
(laughter)
Something about Italians on their asses, man.
Both (gasp): Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have stickers on your neck. (groans)
Ow!
"The man, the legend"?
Wouldn't that mean he has no penis at all?
Look, I had no choice, okay?
He's sleeping on my shirt.
We need to go! Walk of shame!
Let's make a move...
Wait, a minute. Why do women have to have a label for going home in the morning when for men it's just... going home.
Why don't we just call ourselves what we are?
Two respectable women... rushing to their car.
Great.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
The sun! Hellfire!
Where's the car? Where's my car?
No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No! No! No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!
What are we gonna do?
My phone's d*ad.
My phone is d*ad, too.
I have no cash. Now, what are we gonna do?
Are we gonna walk?
My feet are wrecked, okay?
And carrying shoes?
That's legit walk of shame.
Please stop saying "walk of shame."
Also "legit."
Not crazy about that word, either.
If that South African runner who k*lled his girlfriend can run with no legs, we can walk in heels.
Cece: Excuse you!
Those little bitches throwing us shade? Hey!
Keep it moving! (both laugh)
This is a middle school vice principal and can give both of you detention.
Jess: Hey, would one of you let us use your phone in exchange for...
Cece?
What? Mm-hmm.
Cheese and a condom?
It's for emergencies.
Do you think Nick and Winston should come to May's thing?
No.
I mean, I'm so freaked out that they're gonna embarrass me.
I'm barely holding my own with May's friends as it is.
It's always Neo-romanticism with that guy... like Rihm, Rochberg, Zwilich.
You know what song I find Neo-romantic?
(humming Johnny Pearson's "Heavy Action")
It's Monday Night Football?
Uh...
Why is it, like, weird right now?
It's a good thing that I'm coming with you.
I know a ton about classical music.
I played the ghost of Rachmaninoff in a loosely based high school production of Shine.
Now, do you think I'm crazy for, like, thinking like that?
Like, what do you think about Nick and Winston coming?
You know, I brought Nick to a work dinner once.
(whoops) That was fun!
Now, that place was fancy.
(groans)
(grunts)
Vest without a shirt?
I mean, it's a clean look.
It's just not for that occasion. You-you don't think we should tell them not to come, though, right?
I think we can tell them whatever we want.
Oh, hey, hey. And then... so, that's, it's his side.
Hey, Nick!
(sputters)
What's up, man?
Nick, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up!
Male voice: The voice mailbox for...
Nick: Penis Wilson.
Male voice: is full. Good-bye.
And there it is.
All the numbers I know by heart.
That's more than me.
Learn from us.
Also, never open a line of credit for your boyfriend no matter how talented of an artist he is.
Uh, we are walking.
We're walking.
Cece: All right.
This is a legit walk of shame.
Oh, yeah. (car horn honks)
Rough start, ladies!
It was the blow-out.
It was the blow-out.
It's gonna be okay. Come on, let's go.
Oh, my God, they look so comfy.
Okay, you got it, okay? You got it.
Just give it a good... (grunts)
Oh, God, I need those sneakers.
Ooh!
So close, so close.
You got it on this one, you got it, you got it.
Yeah.
(screams)
No! No!
Let's follow that train.
Jess: Look at it, just sitting there, so full and so watery.
If we steal that water, are we criminals?
If we cross this fence, are we crossing a line that we can never...?
Shut up, we are going in.
Winston: Makes sense.
Ugh, I can't believe we have to go to that stupid music thing.
I just found these two-for-one coupons to the water park.
Wow.
They reopened the wave pool because it's been two years to the day since that guy d*ed.
R.I.P. Mike Beakman.
Schmidt: All right, you know what?
I'll... I'll take one for the team.
You guys go to the water park, and I'll go with Coach.
Coach: Really?
My eyes react poorly to children's urine anyway.
Don't ask me how I know that.
Sweet.
You guys are gonna have so much fun without us.
Yeah, come on, Coach.
Man...
Let's go put on our most scrotum-crushing trousers.
Thanks a lot, guys.
(chuckles)
Those lousy serpents.
They don't want us to come.
Damn lousy serpents.
(hissing)
They must think we're stupid.
I don't want to go...
Mm-hmm.
But I don't like the idea of not going because they don't want us to go, rather than not going because we don't want to go.
That's right, 'cause if we don't go, then who gonna go when we don't want to, 'cause we go.
Right? Rewind.
Come on, I'm being very clear here.
Where are we going and why?
We're going everywhere for both reasons.
(hissing)
How do you do it so smooth?
(hisses) Just... (hisses) ...exhale.
(stuttering hiss)
(smooth hiss)
(stuttering hiss)
I just can't do it. I don't even care about it.
Just gonna...
Oh, that's heavy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's just knock it over. Push it ov... push it.
Push, push...
Go.
Oh! Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back.
We're trapped.
Now what? Wait until the kid's party's over?
Kids unwrap presents so slowly.
I know. Kids are so slow.
I think this is rock bottom.
Cece...
I have to tell you something embarrassing.
What?
I didn't sleep with Bear Claw last night.
I did something even worse.

(giggles weakly) All right.
Confession.
I did not sleep with Ken, either.
Yeah, we started hooking up and then I called him... Schmidt.
That's okay. It happens.
Twice.
Whatever.
Four times.
Okay, that's bad.
I know, I felt so bad afterwards, I straightened up his room.
I am a grown woman that is in love with her ex-boyfriend that has a girlfriend.
And I've been stealing my neighbor's Wi-Fi.
I mean, what have I become?
This day is about to turn around.
Wait.
Coach.
What?
Just-just put it in your pocket.
No, dude. It had pork belly on it.
Just put it in your pocket. Do it.
I used to play the violin.
Then I became a real musician.
(laughs)
Because your instrument's bigger, right?
(chuckles)
Cello knowledge.
Yeah.
(whispering): The cello is bigger.
Nice.
(Nick and Winston laughing)
The hell are they doing here?
I don't know.
They're drinking at a normal pace.
There's nothing stuck to them.
Exactly.
The hell are they up to?
You are a genius.
Sweet, sweet city water.
Okay. You know how today's been kind of like a-a crappy day?
Mm-hmm.
Well, how would you feel if that hose belonged to your ex-boyfriend?
Jess?
Genzlinger!
Hey! Uh...
Blast from the past!
How's that ass?
That ass is good.
I don't know if that's an expression, but...
How the heck are you?
Good. How... Oop.
Heh. Don't know why I did that.
Did it again. I don't know why.
Why you guys dressed up all nice? Huh?
Talking all polite and stuff. What-What's going on?
Oh, we're just here for the culture and, uh, the spectacle of it all.
Really?
And to make you look like a stupid piece of crap for thinking we'd be an embarrassment to you.
I'm patting you down.
Hey.
I'm an American citizen.
I request a female if you're gonna do that.
Stop it. Stop.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Ah, ah.
Get your paws off of me.
I feel something!
I feel something!
Show some class, Coach.
Nick: Get your paws off of me!
Ow!
Toothpick in my leg! (descending notes)
Oh, dip.
Ernie!
Please apologize to Frondi.
The flautist.
Uh...

Oh.
Sorry, Frondi.
I should go.
We'll take care of the charges and the damages.
We'll spare no expense.
No, we will not. No, we will not.
We will spare no expense.
No, we will not.
So, yeah, I got promoted to Vice Principal.
VP.
Great.
I have a bottle of soy sauce on my desk, so no more packets for me.
Hey, you got a little roly poly bug on you, hmm?
Oh...
I get it.
What?
I wasn't born yesterday!
You think we're on a walk of shame.
Didn't, but...
Congratulations.
You spend your Sundays having cupcake parties at your beautiful house with your cute little half-Asian kid and your daddy diaper bag...
I think someone might need a visit from the "rest police."
Just because I don't have a husband or a baby or a house doesn't mean I'm not living right.
We're still growing and changing.
Yeah.
And that's a good thing.
Look at this hair.
This is single-girl hair.
This is adventure hair.
This isn't boring, married, settled hair.
This is... this is fun.
We're fun.
You know what I did last night?
I got totally obliterated, and I made up a musical fable with a guy named Bear Claw, and it was better than sex.
♪ I'm a little fox, but I'm not that sly ♪
♪ What can I say? ♪
♪ I'm an honest little guy. ♪
Well, I'm glad things are good...
You know what, Genzlinger?
I don't care what you think of me.
'Cause this is my journey.
Welcome to my freaking journey.
Great, I wish you luck...
You ready?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That's not Jenn.
(sighs)
Nope.
This is not my house, okay?
This is not a daddy diaper bag, This is a bag of sadness.
Because I am a party clown. (squeaks)
I'm actually a musical party clown, okay?
So no one's had a more shameful walk this morning than me.
(squeaks)
What happened to Jenn?
Thanks for bringing that up.
Salt in the wound.
She left me.
You know what I did last night?
I'm gonna tell you.
I masturbated to p*rn that I had to draw on the back of an envelope.
(chuckles) Mmm.
He's great with kids.
Who are you?
I'm a Liza Minnelli impersonator.
♪ Ah... ♪
So...
Ah, guys, look, I don't see much of the toothpick coming out.
So, best move...
Push it all the way in, and get it from the other side.
Am I right? You guys agree?
How could you guys do this to me?
Nick: We didn't do anything.
You embarrassed yourself.
Actually, you embarrassed us.
And you do it all the time, Coach.
Like how you sit on the hood of your car when you pump gas into it.
I mean, what, are you in Dukes of Hazzard, you idiot?
I saw Isaiah Thomas do it on a poster once, and it was cool.
And what are you laughing at, all right?
What?
You put ChapStick on like a little girl putting on lipstick for the first time.
(chuckling): It's way too much puckering.
Winston, you know what, you shut up.
Cold busted.
You're the most embarrassing one of our friends by far.
With your singing.
Outfits. - And the crystals.
Your mural.
The mustache. - Your fauxhawk.
Your bell.
Puzzles. - Cat.
FYI... you guys live with the cat, too.
But at least I get to reap the benefits.
(chuckles)
That... (door opens)
Ah.
(chuckling): Oh, oh.
Look, it's not what it looks like, my man.
Um, we're just trying to squeeze something out of my buddy.
We'll be done when it comes out.
(clicks tongue)
Coach: Well, maybe it's not gonna work with May.
She's too good for me.
I should just go back to having soulless sex with beautiful women I share no emotional connection...
(shouts) Oh!
All my hard work.
May didn't start liking you because you play some dumb instrument.
She started liking you because you're cocky.
And you're funny.
What, you're afraid of her because she plays the standing-up guitar?
He's right, Coach, I don't know why we're trying so hard to make you fit in here.
You're Coach, sex in a sweat suit.
Yeah.
If I've tought you one thing, it's lead out with confidence.
Follow up with comedy.
And number trey, your home run, your triple...
Have great looks.
I got 'em, and I passed them on to you.
So get out there, you beautiful peacock.
Shake your tail feathers.
I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.
Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.
You don't have to clown for these people.
Yes, you do.
She said...
Open yourself up to the journey.
Look, if Taylor Swift can live alone in New York, just think what you can do.
The only thing stopping you is you.
Yeah.
Ma'am, I will not clown for you today.
Or any day thereafter.
What are you doing?
I am going on a journey.
This is my freaking journey.
(squeaking)
We're taking back the morning. (whoops)
Jess: Happy birthday to your little one.
May, we run in different circles.
My circle's not even really a circle.
It's more of a swirling mass of idiots.
But, uh, that's me.
Yeah, you didn't have to come back in here to tell me you were an idiot.
No.
What I need to tell you is I like you.
And that, um... and that I hate classical music.
I'm sorry, I do... I hate it.
I mean, there's so many better kinds of music now, it's...
Okay.
Yeah.
But if you're playing it, I want to listen.
'Cause you mean a lot to me.
All right.
I'm gonna play you a song, and if you can name it...
(sighs) then we can give this another sh*t.
If you don't want to do this, just... it's... I'm fine.
(plays Johnny Pearson's "Heavy Action")
That's Monday Night Football!
Yeah, I learned it for you.
All right.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
That poked me.
Okay.
No, just don't touch it, don't touch it.
Okay, okay, okay.
But okay.
Okay.
Los Angeles! (shoes squeaking)
We are sluts and we are clowns!
But we are not losers!
We are not losers!
Yes!
No, we're adventurers!
Shame, shame, I know your name.
Ah... yo, Nicholas!
Hey, Genzlinger!
I miss you, man!
Great shoes!
Guess what, guys, I'm still here.
Take that, Lyme's disease!
Cecilia, what is that shirt?
"The man, the legend"?
Oh, I think you've met the legend.
Hey, you guys want a ride?!
Yeah!
Nah!
No.
No, we've made it this far.
We're just gonna carry on through.
Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Yeah.
Take that, City of Angels!
For the true angels are we!
Yes!
Charisma, we didn't waste your blow-out!
I know we are having a moment here.
Just take it down a notch.
(elevator dings)
Oh, thank God we made it.
Bear Claw: Uh, Jess.
You forgot your purse.
I didn't look inside.
(whispering): But I did feel around.
Thanks, Bear Claw.

Thank you.
All right, clockwise, honey.
Don't fight it.
Let me make you.
What... is that?
This is the only thing us Miller men know how to make.
And we call it The Sauce.
It stinks.
It doesn't stink.
Fawn is coming over for a midnight fondue supper.
There's no chocolate or cheese on this earth that makes a cube of bread pop like The Sauce.
Your girlfriend's coming over for the first time, and you asked Nick to cook?
True, normally food à la Nick would be less appealing to me than licking the floor of a beach bathroom.
But I want Fawn to have the best, and The Sauce is the best.
Good for you... when you said "Fawn" and then "fondue," I definitely thought you were headed in the direction of...
Step one: fondue.
Step two: do Fawn.
That's not bad.
Yeah, I was, like, "Fondue is Fawn done."
Th-These are all good.
Hey, has anybody heard for Cece?
'Cause she hasn't answered any of my texts, and I'm starting to get worried.
Jess is starting to find your behavior...
"suspicious."
That's a police word.
It's not a police word, Winston.
It's a very common word.
And you know why I'm keeping my distance.
I like Schmidt.
For the second time!
I know how many times.
Ah. Ah.
If you could see my face right now, I'm smiling, and I'm saying, "Ah."
And if Jess finds out, she's gonna want to get involved, and I don't want her involved because there's nothing that she can do.
Look, if you act suspicious, then she's gonna be suspicious, all right?
Look, don't slink your head in the dumps.
You got to raise your hand with the sunshine wh-where people walk, you know?
Because that's what the whole point of the... when the... if you can lead 'em to water, but you can't make a sound, right?
Look, just call her.
Fine, okay, I'll call her.
But... and listen to me, she cannot find out.
Under no circumstance.
Okay, baby.
Look, your secret is safe with me.
That being said, I am not a smooth man.
Yeah, I get that.
Did I do something to piss Cece off?
Oh, Schmidt, you have something on your pants.
Ah! It's a spider!
Jess, why did you do that?
You know how he gets... He turns into a cartoon elephant of yesteryear who just saw a mouse.
Which is offensive in present day 'cause it seems like a gay stereotype they tried to sneak by us.
"Where's my balance ball?
There's a mouse loose in the house."
Where is it? We've got to hunt it down.
We got to have a spiderhunt.
We're not having one of those.
No, dude, no more spiderhunts.
Guys, they're all over me!
This is childish, and you need to get over it.
Jess, would you please? You know this fear comes from a very real place... 1999.
American Pie was sweeping the nation.
And everybody was doing it with pies.
I just happened to accidentally fall asleep right afterwards.
And when I awoke, the dried apple filling was... it just had attracted so many spiders, and they were all over it, and I...
Okay, everyone was doing it with pies?
Well, Y2K was an uncertain time.
I don't know "everyone," Jess.
I might have dabbled.
Fawn can't see me like this.
Fawn won't care.
Jess, I'm embarrassed... for her to see me in this state.
You're fine...
It's embarrassing... just a little spider!
You're fine.
And there it is! I just saw it!
Get off the table.
We'll do the spiderhunt.
Fawn can't see you like this.
There it is!
It's right there... It's licking it's lips.
So I'm finally e-mailing that girl, May.
Nice.
Here's what I got so far.
Mm-hmm.
"Dear May.
Lay down on me."
Well, th-then what?
You met this woman weeks ago... I can't believe you haven't e-mailed her. Just text her.
If I had her number, I would text her.
She gave me her e-mail.
And now I have to write how I feel.
Which is weird, it's like...
I-I like her. Much.
You like her much?
All right.
"Girl, it's warm today.
"Yesterday was warm, too.
Yeah."
Yeah, I'm gonna write, "Yeah."
You're happy about this?
Damn it, no, it doesn't feel right.
Yeah, just hold it down, hold it down.
Okay, you guys know the drill.
We split up into teams, and we hunt this spider.
Why can't we just call an exterminator?
Yes.
They've all blocked Schmidt's calls since the dandelion incident.
It moved like a spider, Nick!
I don't know a Cece.
Yeah, I do. How the hell are you?
Jess, please, hurry up, we're on a hunt!
It could be right above our heads right now.
Hanging from its butt-rope.
Come over.
I can't.
Why not?
Did I do something?
Are we in another purse thing that I don't know about?
No, no, Jess, of course it's not you.
It would just be... an honor.
I'll be right there.
Great, wear shoes that you don't mind getting spider guts on.
Bye.
So... what's going on with Cece?
Well, I had to beg her like a nerd, but she's finally coming over.
Oh, she's coming over.
Yeah.
Good, man.
Took a lot of cajoling.
That's cool.
Normally, it's, like, she'll come over all the time.
But now it's diff... I don't know why that would be the case at all, but that's cool... I respect the decision for her to come over.
Why are you acting weird?
I'm acting weird?
Mm.
Do you know something?
Do...?
You... I'm not a smooth man.
Is she mad at someone?
Ah... no.
No.
No, she's not mad at anyone.
It's the opposite.
Mm.
It's the opposite?
That's not what I said.
You said, "No, no, she's not mad at anyone.
It's the opposite."
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
"Cheese is bad e'ryone.
Let's stop and spit."
The opposite of mad is...
Does she like someone?
What would make you assume that would be...?
I can hear it.
I can hear it building its house.
Building its sticky, deadly house that you can never leave.
Building it.
With its ass.
We're breaking up into two-person teams.
Cece.
Each team has one Smusher and one Jar-Man.
Nick, I'm gonna make you a Smusher since you have to stir.
Hey, am I stirring right now?
Or is my arm still, and the world is stirring?
Coach, you're a Jar-Man.
Mm.
You're with Schmidt.
Cece, with your delicate little hands, you're a born Jar-Man.
Okay.
Which means I need to pair you up with a Smusher.
I smush.
That'd be me.
Smusher for life.
You're such a Jar-Man.
You don't even know you're a Jar-Man, Jar-Man.
Yeah, you are.
You're a born J-man. Come on, Winston.
Uh, Cece.
Yeah.
Before we get started, you want to have a quick Jar-Man strategy session?
A little Jar-Jar strat sesh?
Are you winking or farting?
The only strategy is... find the spider, k*ll the spider, mount the spider's head on top of the roof so all the other spiders know.
All right. And spiderhunt!
Spiderhunt!
Spiderhunt!
You find that thing... you-you make sure that it's done.
That's the plan, that's...
Okay.
Hey, what do you think Jess and Cece are talking about?
Oh, probably that stupid movie theater popcorn machine that Cece wants me to get for the bar.
She keeps haranguing me about it.
"Popcorn machine, popcorn machine."
Look, I don't know what void Cece's trying to fill in her life...
I don't know, either. Why would I know?
You know, I don't know what void she's trying to fill.
It's all she wants to talk about.
Oh.
Stupid movie theater popcorn machine.
I'm like, "Shut up, dude."
You put bologna in your Bolognese?
Where else would it get its name?
Trick question... it gets it from the mayonnaise.
Yeah, yeah.
You got it.
Do you think a good subject line is, "The Inside of You"?
Hey, you know, I bet I could spot this spider a lot better if I was on your shoulders.
Do not ask me again to get on my shoulders.
That's a once-a-year thing, and you already used it on Halloween, when we were ten-foot-tall Ralph Macchio.
Ow! Damn it!
That was cool.
I didn't like that. I could feel your genitals on the back of my neck like an airplane pillow.
Okay, you know what? How about this?
I'm not sure why he did it but I sure am glad that God rearranged the letters in yam to... create something even sweeter.
What?
May.
Oh, May, yeah. Yeah, all right.
Keep going, keep going.
Oh, dear God.
It's left the web to feed.
All right, I'll put that.
Seems like a weird thing to say.
Lots of bars have popcorn machines.
I really think that people would dig it.
They're not that expensive.
And everybody loves fresh popcorn.
Do you like somebody in the loft?
Winston.
Okay, what did he tell you?
He told me you like someone but he won't name names.
Is it Schmidt? Do you like Schmidt again?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Absolutely not. No.
Who is it then? Who?
I want to tell you. I want to tell you so, like, so badly... You know me...
I want to tell you so bad, I just, um, I'm very sorry, but I can't.
Right, right, right, right, you can't tell anybody... except freaking Winston!
That slow puzzler!
I know. I'm lower down on the food chain No!
Than Officer Cat Fancy?!
No. No, no, no, no. It's just I know that you would do anything to help me, and in this situation, you know, there's just nothing to be done.
And we both know that you would just want to get involved.
Well, I can stay uninvolved.
I want to tell you, but I can't.
I just can't.
Okay. That's fine. Okay.
That's cool, that's cool. New teams!
You have to tell me who she likes.
There are no secrets between Jar-Man and Smusher.
Please!
She's my best friend. You have to tell me.
Okay.
Look, Jess... she likes me.
It's me she wants.
Not even for a second.
I thought I was convincing.
Yeah.
I need you to close your eyes and taste it.
Okay.
Oh... Oh, Nick... It's legit terrible.
Well, you taste for texture not taste you big old...
Not really what I was looking for at this stage.
Definitely affects my confidence.
Wait. Wait!
The only person that Cece could like that she wouldn't want to tell me about... is Nick!
Uh...
Does Cece like Nick?
Does Cece like...?
Oh, my...
No... you guessed it.
How you did that?
Oh, my God. My ex-boyfriend and my best friend?
I feel like... Brenda when Kelly dated Dylan!
Or the other way around.
Now I know those are the characters from the original 90210.
But that's about my ceiling. Dylan... was his nickname the Peach Pit? 'Cause I remember...
I remember that being a whole thing.
I'm sorry, I'm a little wound up.
You should be wound up because the Peach Pit used to be yours, but now Brenda want a slice.
Everybody trying to get a slice of that Peach Pit.
You have every right to be mad, Jess, but just do it quietly.
You know, just do it on the low, do it in here.
30 seconds, and you haven't brought up the popcorn machine.
Yeah, well, I guess I'm just gonna have to drop it.
You know, even Jess didn't want to hear about it, and she'll listen to Schmidt discussing Andy Cohen discussing Bethenny discussing NeNe.
Well, great, I'm glad that's behind us.
Yeah.
Now let's never speak of popcorn machines again.
Cece and Nick?
Cece likes Nick?
Cece likes Nick?!
I mean, I guess I understand it 'cause they're at the bar together and once you start sharing tips, where does the sharing end?
Look... Jess, it's not that big of a deal.
Because we all just cats and dogs at the end of the day.
What about Schmidt? Schmidt's Nick's best friend, and Schmidt and Cece have a history.
Look at the memory on you.
I'm gonna have to help Schmidt through this.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look, Jess, you can't talk to Schmidt about Cece liking Nick.
Come on.
No, you're right. I have to talk to Cece first.
Right, you got to talk to Ce... No, wait, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jess, you can't talk to Cece because Cece, you know, and Nick, they just won't work. 'Cause I was talking to Nick.
He said, "Winston." I was like, "What's up, Nick?" He said...
What?
He said she ugly.
He said what?!
Yeah, he said she look like a dang ol' meatball with hair.
New teams!
You know who's great?
Cece. One of our finest.
Lovely woman.
And she has so much to offer.
Is that what this is about?
She sends you to sell me on it?
No, Nick. She doesn't know I'm talking to you at all. Wait.
You guys have talked about it?
All the time.
But I thought she and I had come to a decision.
Which is?
It's not happening.
Well, why not? 'Cause I'm not interested.
And I know it's not cool to say, but...
I don't like the way it would look.
People are gonna say what they're gonna say. They're not reasons not to go through with it.
Fine. You want to know my biggest concern?
My biggest concern is the smell.
The smell?
The smell of it.
Yeah, and it's not Cece's fault.
I mean, they all smell. I've told her that.
You told Cece you think all women...
Don't make this a feminist thing...
It... I'm not making it a feminist thing.
How? They smell terrible. It's common knowledge.
I thought your biggest concern would be how it affected the people around you.
I mean, sure, a bunch of old drunks will grab at it...
But if your biggest concern is the smell, I'm sure that's highly manageable.
Yeah, I guess there's, like, special solvents and soaps.
I-I haven't read up on it that much.
You know, but you got to really get in there and scrub it out.
It's disgusting.
You know, 'cause of the daily wear and tear and... oil and grease just cooking in there.
It's enough to make a man barf thinking about it.
I mean, they get really hot.
I know what temperature it gets.
Hot.. But if I'm being honest, you know... And I haven't talked to her about this... but... I do have good memories associated with the smell.
Ball games, the circus, hanging with my dad.
Listen here, you idiot. I've known Cece a very long time, and I can promise you the smell will not be a problem.
That's really easy for you to say 'cause you're not the one who's gonna have to remind her to clean it all the time.
I promise you, if it becomes a problem...
I will remind her.
Well, if you remind her and she doesn't do it, I don't want you sneaking around and cleaning it yourself.
Nick.
I'm a good friend, but I am not that good of a friend.
"...that a dream house is a house, but a dreamboat is a person."
I mean, it does speak to the soul.
Hey, what are these? I've always wondered.
Those are grapes.
Uh, they're our glass grapes, bro.
Grapes?
Brings the whole, like, room together.
What the hell they doing in the loft?
Cece, um, do ladies have loins?
You know, it's like I've never looked around this house before.
Skimboards, a boxing glove.
Who in this loft has been to a single Coachella, let alone six of them?
Don't tell Cece that we talked.
She doesn't want me getting involved.
Of course she does, she just didn't think you were into the idea, okay?
She really values your opinion.
What if you guys had a r... a r-real talk?
You know, outside of the bar.
All right.
We'll talk, just the two of us, outside the bar.
I'm proud of you, Nick.
Just make sure she makes her case about facts and figures.
And no more of this, "Come on, Nick, it tastes so yummy" crap.
New teams!
♪ I want to do something freaky to you... ♪
No one can resist my "Get Frisky" playlist, guys.

Wait a minute, is your e-mail address owwMeSoErnie@coolidge?
Still?
Yeah, man. Picked it in college.
It's just gonna follow me from job to job, ISP to ISP.
We've been everywhere together, brotha.
Never done .org or a .gov.
Oh.
I would never do that.
Right.
But every other damn domain.
You can't e-mail a girl like May from an e-mail address like owwMeSoErnie.
Although, you did got a job at a school, so, what do I know?
I must really like this girl, huh?
Okay, it says here, we need "a m*rder of peppercorn," and a... and "some of that flat Jew bread"?
Miller family!
m*rder is over there. it could be something really beautiful, and you-you won't know unless you try.
Okay! Jess!
You don't have to trap me in your room.
We will, on a trial basis, rent a popcorn machine.
Okay?
Something's wrong with my Sauce.
My Sauce!
Hey.
Hey.
You...?
I...
With him?
Winston.
Wh-Where'd it go?
How long has this been unstirred?!
40 seconds. 45 tops.
Is it 40 or 45?
Spider!
Schmidt! Schmidt!
Whoa!
Come on, man!
No! Aah!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, it's gone.
Get him!
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. It can't hurt you.
It can't hurt you.
Where is... where is the body?!
He was headed straight for The Sauce!
Can you imagine how powerful that spider would've become had he entered my Sauce?
Did I break it?
You sent all 15 drafts of my e-mail to May.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
Way I see it, we got two options.
All right, well, what are the two options, man?
I mean, you know, just, you got to just dive in, you know?
No, you don't have any options. I don't have any options.
Sometimes you don't have to talk.
I'm really sorry, Coach.
I-I'll make it up to you.
But the good news is, is we got that spider, huh?
Don't have to worry about that thing anymore.
What? What are you guys trying to tell me?
So, it is Schmidt?
Yeah.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but...
No, it's okay. It's okay.
Look, I promise I won't tell him.
Nobody's gonna tell him.
Okay.
Hey, somebody tell him.
You tell him, but easy.
Tell him. I don't want to tell him, dude. You tell him.
We're all his best friends. Tell him.
I think I'm pretty good with it now.
Hey, Schmidt, I...
I mean, spiders and all.
Tell him!
I don't want to tell him.
Somebody just tell him!
Guys, just tell me.
You're being so dramatic right now.
You have a spider on your face.
What are you talking about?
I touched it!
Get it off!
Okay. - Oh!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! Get it off! Get it off of me!
Get it away from me! Get it off!
Get it off!
Hey, hey, the spider.
Get it off! Don't touch!
Hello.
Don't touch! Get it off of me!
Get it...!
Schmidt.
Hold still.
Aah!
Oh! Oh!
Oh...
Ah!
What's up now, spider?
Vote Moscato!
Well, it can't hear you.
But, seriously, vote Moscato.
So, that guy, huh?
Yeah. Can you blame me?
He's perfect.
And when is dinner?
Is it, um...?
The Sauce! Sauce.
The Sauce.
Yeah. 'Cause Fawn's hungry. My e-mails.
I'm about to pick you up with a tissue like you wouldn't believe!
So, what's the plan?
Jess. I'm gonna pick you up with a tissue so hard!
He's happy. He has a girlfriend.
Yeah, spi-spider!
I know, but it's you, and Fawn kind of scares me.
Let this be a warning to all your other little, uh, spider friends hiding out, too.
I know that would do anything for anybody, but right now, I just need you to... be there for me and hold my hand, okay?
That's all.
Little half-insects, half-lobsters.
Ah...
I really want to do something.
Don't go up the spout if you can't handle the rain, s-spider!
Okay, well, you've done it.
The perfect burn of the d*ad bug.
Yeah, that's right.
Now stop. : Okay.
The Sauce is shockingly great.
This tastes like the inside of a bear, and that is a compliment, my friend.
All right.
I... Oh.
Oh. May responded to my e-mails.
"I appreciate how much effort you put into these.
I'd love to go out."
Hey.
Great.
All right.
There you go.
Yeah!
Uh, you're welcome.
This is great guys, right?
To Fawn.
Oh.
A woman who likes me not in spite, but because of my flaws.
I do like you.
But I hate your flaws.
And to all my friends.
In the spiderhunt of life...
I sure am glad that we're a team of six.
Cheers!
Hey! Hey!
To those who...
Okay. No, that's good.
And thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
All right, here we go.
Ow.
Oh.
Yeah, sweep the leg, Johnny.
The guys and I are about to leave for the airport, and I'm so excited to see you.
Is that Ryan?
I can't wait for you to see my hometown.
It's going to be just like An Affair to Remember, only instead of the Empire State Building on New Year's Eve, it's going to be a winery near the Portland airport at my dad's wedding.
Anyway, I love you, I miss you.
(Schmidt groans)
Hello? Hello?
Sounds like I lost you for a minute!
(chuckles)
Are you there?!
Where's my widdle Eng-wish man?
And with that, Ryan walked into the River Thames and accepted death.
The joke's on you, 'cause I wasn't even talking to him.
I was leaving a voice mail.
Haven't talked to him for a week.
Are you guys making a group face?
No, we're not...
No.
Nah.
Guys, look, Ryan and I are great.
Really? 'Cause he doesn't call enough.
And when he does, it's in the middle of the night.
Ryan didn't want to move to England, he had to move to England.
For the last couple of weeks, you've been keeping Nick hours, and... and it's ugly.
Hey. Sorry.
I was talking to Ryan before he went to work and I must have fallen asleep.
Friend to friend, am I wearing pants?
The situation isn't ideal, however, long distance is super romantic.
Plus I don't have to shave my legs every day which is a real plus.
You know, Fawn shaves herself from toe to chin.
Every single day.
God, I love my girlfriend.
Hey. Oh, Cece.
Cece: Yeah, what? Huge news.
Jake Apex is coming to the wedding.
Jake Apex?
Who is Jake Apex?
Jake Apex is Cece's high school crush.
Never did anything for me, but turned Cece to soup.
Thanks.
Mm. Yeah.
Is he one of them Portland hippies?
'Cause I hate them Portland hippies.
Cece: He is a legend.
Every time I spoke to him, I'd have a full-bl*wn tiny kid stroke.
Hey, k*ller.
I... d... uh... mm...
(sputters)
Yeah, well, I got a bad feeling about this guy.
Why, because he's b*mb and Cece wants some?
No. Other reasons.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go water my succulents.
How do you know Apex is so cute?
I just assumed.
Winston, stop with the look, okay?
Otherwise I will m*rder you and clean up your blood with your cat.
All right? For the 50th time, I do not like Schmidt.
Good luck finding my cat.
You know, I haven't seen him in weeks.
My best man suit.
Oh.
I'm my dad's best man.
He wanted a boy. My middle name's Christopher.
Yeah.

Man: That's really good.
(applauding, whooping)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
This is a nice place.
I mean, it's not the best vineyard in Portland.
Here we go.
That's Bartleby Cellars, of course.
How would you even know that?
Whenever Coach goes to a new city, he learns all about it, like a real weirdo.
I was an army brat, all right?
I moved a lot. Assimilating was key.
Oh, and by the way, calling somebody weird in Portland is actually a compliment, so thank you, Nick.
Hey, oh.
It's just... Oh.
Sorry, I thought I heard my phone ringing.
Ryan's supposed to call me before he gets on the plane.
Oh! Sorry.
Jess, just take your phone out.
No, Nick, I want to be here with you guys.
I want to... Sorry.
I just want to...
Sorry.
Does anybody else hear buzzing?
No.
No, 'cause it's not buzzing.
No, honey, but, you know, he's going to be here soon, okay?
Yeah.
Are you guys still touring the city?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I made about 12 drafts of this map.
Couldn't figure out where to go.
Had to fit 18 years into one morning.
So, here it is.
Aw. I'm so excited to show him Portland, and my mom is so excited to meet him.
And I'm going to show him...
Jess, it's not buzzing.
It's not buzzing.
I promise you it's not.
It's not buzzing.
Oh, there's my dad.
Hey, guys.
Sounded great. You sounded great.
You look terrific, too.
Hey!
Oh, there's my daughter.
Oh...
I thought we talked about you not calling me that.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, how's the food?
I haven't eaten in three weeks.
Trying to fit into my wedding dress.
(laughs)
Had a dream about a crouton last night.
And, um...
And that was the whole dream.
Ooh, before I forget, best man.
(chuckles) Aw.
The wedding rings.
Hey, I want you to meet a bunch of relatives that are all going to be d*ad in a couple of years.
Oh, good idea.
Oh.
Hey, what happened to the British guy?
He's coming tomorrow.
Man: Hey, Jake.
Jake Apex. That's him. That's him right there.
Winston: I will say one thing about that man that I've only said about Ryan Gosling... hot damn!
What's up, Winston?
I'm gonna just go...
I'm gonna go talk to him, yeah.
Winston: You're good.
Yup.
You're okay.
Gonna...
I didn't know that was a thing. You...
Okay.
(inaudible)
Schmidt: Oh, this is very hard to watch.
It's like when Bob Costas had that eye infection at the O-Lympics.
You mean the Olympics.
(Cece laughing hard)
(whoops)
Okay. Oh, God.
Okay, what happened?
Did I look cool?
Uh...
Define "cool."
What happened? I don't know what hap... I blacked out.
Okay, look, Cece...
I'm gonna help you.
I'm Usher, you're Bieber.
And Jake Apex is all the hot tracks that we're going to make together.
Hey.
Hey.
So, um... Ryan's not coming.
Oh, boy.
He has to work on Monday and he thought, ultimately, it didn't make sense, which makes sense.
It's not a big deal.
But the tour's canceled.
(in Southern accent): Hey, Randy, the tour's canceled.
(in normal voice): I don't know why I did that.
Anyway, go ahead, Nick. Go ahead.
Talk about how much this sucks.
Tell me that Ryan's not coming 'cause he's a blank who's a blank.
I do have one thing to say.
While you were away, we were all talking about how much we wanted to go on the tour.
So don't cancel it. We'll do it with you!
Really?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes!
Really?
Yes!
Fired up.
We haven't stopped talking about...
Yeah, man.
Couldn't be more excited.
All 18 places!
There's 18?
Wow.
I'm going to add a few more stops, then.
I definitely know you'd enjoy the Shakespeare Garden.
Ha-ha, great.
Guys, Jess says she's fine, but I know she's not.
Okay? She needs cheering up.
We're in her hometown.
I can't believe Ryan bailed.
I'm not happy with what Ryan's doing.
It's, it's not cool.
But today, it's all sunshine and smiles.
Hey, hey, hey, hey... Let me, let me get sunshine.
Let me get sunshine.
Okay, yeah, you can be sunshine.
Yes! (laughs)
Here she is... Sunshine and smiles!
(all cheering)
Jess!
Winston: Sending the sun in!
Hi.
So... I'm sorry this is so small.
It was just meant for Ryan and me.
No worries.
No problem. - It's great.
Your shoes look super-cute.
You look great.
You look great.
Let's see if... Ryan...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Give me that purse! No more checking in with Ryan.
The tour starts now.
(all cheering)
Jess: And there's the Italian soda shop where I first learning what a "not" joke was.
Not!
I... I learned it, actually, in the candle shop, next-door.
People don't really do "not" jokes anymore.
Not! They'll be in forever!
Right, guys?
Not!
(laughs)
Jess: And there's the dance studio where I had my first kiss with the cutest/only boy in my jazz troupe.
Then he came out of the closet... super gay.
Then we kissed some more.
Then he went to Oberlin.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop in that store!
I'm going full Portland, people.
I'm so Portland right now, they all staring at me like, "Is that the president of Portland?"
(laughing)
I'm like, "No."
This is the very pizza place where we'd dab our pizzas with our napkins, to get the grease off, and then we'd make this kid named Joey eat the napkins.
(laughing)
I'm not gonna lie... (forced laugh)
I'm Joey.
Hmm.
(gasping): Oh, my God.
Cece: Oh, no, he's here.
He's here. He just walked in.
Oh, is he a firefighter?
Seems pretty easy in Portland, huh?
(chuckles) Rain just does the work for you.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
No! Do... do not go and talk to him.
Do not go and talk to him.
Cece, not everything's about you, you narcissist.
All right, just... go to the bathroom, like you said you'd...
And... he's talking to him.
Just don't look. Just don't look. Oh, well, he's looking at you.
What? What? Really?
No, like, right now, he's staring at you.
Don't, don't, don't, don't look, don't look.
Don't look. The cutest one's looking right at me.
I don't see a "cute" or "not cute" one, Coach.
If you had to choose, which one's the cutest?
Way to the left.
(whispering): I'm super nervous.
Now my hands are sweating.
Then wipe 'em off.
If he comes over and shakes your hand, you don't want sweaty hands.
Oh, my God!
Schmidt: He said he thinks you're cute.
Cece: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Jess: Hey, Nick, can I have my phone?
You know what? Never mind. I don't care.
So this is my childhood home, the place of my birth.
Thank you guys so much for doing this, and coming on this tour with me.
I forgot all about...
(with British accent): Hello, hello, hello, darling!
("God Save the Queen" playing)
Where's the famous Mr. Geauxinue?
Jess: Um... well... actually, um, Ryan... had to cancel last-minute, so he's not coming.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey... that's just awful.
Aw...
Damn men.
Oh, I feel so bad for you.
Hey, Mom... Mom... Oh, honey...
Um... don't get emotional, okay?
'Cause if you get emotional, I'll get emotional.
Let's talk about happy stuff.
Did you guys see the video of the panda farting and falling of a branch?
(everyone laughing)
Pretty crazy, man.
It was funny. It was funny.
Winston: It made me laugh.
Who wants scramblies?
You know I do, Mom.
(voice breaking): Good.
(crying)
Look, this might not be the right time to say this, you guys, but, uh, should we take a straw poll on this whole Cosby thing?
Jess: I just want to clarify to everyone here that I am fine.
Which is why I'm fine.
Great!
Yeah.
Finer than fine.
Mm-hmm.
Coach: Which is why I'm fine.
Schmidt: Fantastic!
Cece: I'm fine, too. Everybody's great.
Schmidt: Perfect.
(stifled crying)
I'm not fine!
Nick: I can't do this anymore.
It's not all smiles and sunshine.
It's not!
Look, Ryan bailed and that's a dick move.
And that's the truth.
(crying): I'm fine, I'm just gonna go to my room.
(crying): I made scones.
(door slams)
Was that sunshine or smiles? Hmm?
(rock music blaring)
Oh...
Joanie... (chuckles)
I don't want to lie to you, so I'm not...
There's shells all in these eggs.
So, Joan, how do you, uh, feel about Bob getting remarried?
Mm! Oh, I'm fine.
I just feel bad for Ashley.
I mean, let's just say he's a man with a healthy appetite, except one thing.
(coughing)
Well, that's a visual.
I don't really have a burning desire to stick around for the wedding, so I'm going on a trip with some friends.
Hmm!
A trip I've never taken before.
Hmm!
(rock music blaring)
Hey! You mind if I turn this down?
(volume decreases)
"AP Stat Jams."
Advanced Placement.
Very smart.
How many Lilith Fairs did you go to?
Oh, Method Man performed at that one?
It's Liliths Fair.
Like "passersby..." or "attorneys general."
Well, look, I came to, uh... give you this.
Text Ryan as much as you want, it's none of my business.
I just think long-distance relationships suck.
I once broke up with a woman who lived in Irvine, and that's only 30 minutes away.
Mind you, I had hornets living in my car at the time, which was a factor, but the commute was also a big part of it.
Well, look, Nick, we're different, and just because it's difficult with Ryan, doesn't mean we're doomed.
We're star-crossed lovers.
We're like Kate and Leo... or... Claire and Leo, or... whatever blonde Leo is taking on boats.
They're all doomed.
Leo ain't gonna settle down... He ain't ready.
I'm a hopeless romantic, and I always have been.
Which is why...
I mean, it's a nice notion, it's just... from 1994 to 2001, I believed that Jordan Catalano was gonna show up in my driveway after a dirt bike accident, all scruffy and... beautiful... and he would need a bath and some... medical attention.
You think that little boy is driving a dirt bike?
He looks a lot like you.
That's me, that's Jordan Catalano.
I honestly couldn't tell the difference.
I swear to God. I'm not trying to be mean.
You know what the problem with Jordan Catalano is?
Yeah... an undiagnosed learning disability.
Oh, I didn't know the boy had mental problems...
I wouldn't be teasing him, but...
No, it's that he's fake.
The only thing that matters is if the guy is there for you when you need him.
Otherwise, you're dating a wall.
I have to get to my dad's wedding. I didn't...
I didn't come in here trying to be harsh, I'm ju...
I was trying to be helpful and it's not working and I apologize.
I was coming in as a friend, Je...
I'm sure that's just her.
Well, the dream's d*ad.
Apparently, Jake Apex has to work, so he's not gonna come to the wedding.
I'm wearing the craziest underwear for nothing.
Okay, look, Cece, you know what we do? We regroup.
No, it's fine, Schmidt. I'm over it.
It is not fine.
Look, Cece, you're the most amazing woman I ever met.
If you want Jake Apex, I'm gonna help you get Jake Apex.
I'm never gonna stop trying to make you happy, Cece.
I promise you, for the rest of my...
(phone ringing)
Oh, look at that, it's Fawn.
Hello, Councilwoman Moscato.
(quietly): Oh, yeah.
(panting): Guys!
I forgot the rings at the house.
They're in my purse in my room.
And now I have to go get my dad ready.
Apparently, he's wearing some kind of a male corset.
All right, Coach and I will get the rings...
You don't have a car.
All right. Okay.
Wait!
All right.
Let's do this.
(chuckles): Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, ready?
Yep, yep.
Go easy. I'm not on!
You're not?!
I'm not on! I'm not on!
You don't have the rings?!
Well, Dad, hold on...
You don't have the rings?!
Oh! Damn it, no! That's...
No, this is bad.
We're doomed!
You look beautiful, but we are doomed.
(groans)
Oh, yeah.
(sighs)
I wish these were filled with ground beef.
(ringtone playing)
Oh, wait, this is Nick! Nick's calling!
He's probably walking in the door. Here.
Hey.
I found the purse, but your mom has the rings.
What? (chuckles)
Can you ask her for them?
Yeah, it's a little hard right now.
Remember she said she was going on a trip?
(women laughing, howling)
It's gonna be a hair longer.
It's acid, isn't it?
What is taking them so long?
(laughs): Hi!
Um... so the wedding will begin shortly.
(crowd sighs) But first, I'm gonna start you off with a crowd-pleasing, nondenominational...
Something in it for everyone... (chuckles)
"Ave Maria."

Come into the womb.
I don't want to come in the womb.

(f*re alarm wailing)
There are a lot of ways to stall a wedding, okay?
And you just happened to...
Go talk to him.
Yeah. Talk to the guy you like.
Hey, k*ller.
Hey, so, uh...
I'd love to see you again before you leave.
To be honest with you, Cece, I've always had a crush on you.
Oh, God.
Okay, so I've never said this out loud before, but...
I'm... in love with someone else.
It's kind of complicated because he has a girlfriend, so I can't tell anybody.
I mean, Winston knows, but you, you don't know Winston.
I got to get back to the truck soon.
Power steering's out again.
I'm the only one strong enough to drive it.
Of course.
But, uh, I guess I'll see you around.
Yeah, I guess.
(bicycle bell dings)
Okay, okay.
Got it.
Oh, my God! Thank God you guys are here!
Is my mom okay? (both panting)
It's actually really hard riding one of these bikes; it's super tiring.
I don't have a watch on.
I don't know why I'm doing that.
Dad, I...
(Bob humming music)
(continues humming)
Aren't they cute?
Cute as a mute.
That's a thing.
People-people say that.
(sighs)
Love is never what you think it's gonna be, is it?
No, it isn't.
Hey, Nick... you were right.
He should've been here.
I need a guy who shows up.
'Cause anything else just isn't real.
Jess, you should, uh, know something, too.
I touched both your mother's breasts in a communal womb earlier today.
I didn't do it on purpose, but there it is.
Thanks for telling me. I appreciate it.
It's a relief to get it off my shoulders.
Thanks for being cool about it.
I'll leave you alone.
(continues humming)
Wait, what?
I didn't read about this place.
That's because it's not in any guidebook, Tagliaboo.
It is called Crush Pond.
At least that's what Jess and I used to call it.
We used to come down here when she liked somebody.
We'd throw a rock in the pond, and we'd wish that they liked her back.
Huh.
I'd sit over there and smoke cloves while she did that.
I broke up with Ryan.
Wow.
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.
How'd he take it?
Actually, pretty good.
So you got his voice mail.
Yeah.
Sounds about right.
Last stop on the tour.
Um... it's Crush Pond.
So... say a name in your head and throw the rock in the pond, and they'll love you forever.
Um, and for the record, that's actually never worked.
(laughs)
So we're gonna do it anyways?
Jess: Yeah.
We're really gonna do this?
I got a big one.
(singsongy): I know who your rock is for.
Winston, you better shut up before I knock that fade right off your head.
(chuckles): You don't know me like that, Cece. I swear...
Oh, I know you like that, trust me.
Swear to God...
Uh, I'm gonna say Detroit Pistons.
You're not getting it, man.
What-what is it?
You got to say, like, a lady's name.
Oh.
Gladys.
A lady you know.
Oh.
To whoever you are, can't wait to meet you.
And I hope you live close by.
Three, two, one.
(British accent): Hello!
Hey.
Hi.
Happy St. Valentine's Day, mates.
I just spent the week at Ryan's, and it was absolutely lovely.
Coach: Fake accent, smug attitude... This is exactly why the teachers have turned on Jyan.
Jyan?! Come on!
You chose the worst parts of both our names.
That's why we chose it. Haters gonna "H."
That's why Ryan has to find a new job.
You know, I hear Elijah Wood's looking for a stunt double.
(laughter)
He's so small!
Get back in that tree and make me some cookies, Ryan! Cookies!
Yeah!
I know, so hot, right?
Anyway, what's going on in your little lives?
Well, I'm just enjoying the fruits of dating a semi-powerful local politician.
Tonight, it's a Valentine's Day cardiologists' soiree.
Check that out.
Oh!
Oh, my goodness. Is that the invitation?
Wait, that's a real heart? Looks like meat.
It's not shaped like this?
Yeah, well, you know, the cardiologists feel that the traditional cartoon heart, uh... promotes ignorance.
That's gross.
Where's Nick? How is he handling the breakup with Kai?
I don't know... I haven't seen Fat Fat Fatty in a long time.
Yeah, me, either.
Yeah, I haven't seen him since the breakup.
You live in the same room as him.
I've been crashing in your room while you're away.
Is Nick missing?
No, he is not.
Oh, boy.
(chuckling): Hey.
Schmidt: Oh, wow. COACH: You look terrible.
Hey, Nick. Are you covered in gravy?
Nope. I've been in my room for the last week sleeping and thinking and really getting into the comic strip Cathy.
Oh, I'm really excited that we can finally talk about Cathy.
When she's mad, she says, "Ack."
Ack.
Ack.
Ack!
Nick, why would you come out here?
Sounds like you were doing pretty good in there.
Doug's Ale House.
The new bar on Sixth and Spring?
No.
The exact coordinates to complete my bar crawl that I've been working on for almost a decade.
Mmm.
What?! - Ooh.
Schmidt: Big day.
Thanks.
And guess what? Good news.
(imitates drumroll)
It's tonight! Who's in?
Oh...
Winston: You know, I'm on call at the station tonight, so I can't really drink, so...
Fawn's speaking at a cardiologist event.
Ryan and I have a reservation at a really fancy restaurant, so...
You're probably thinking,
"Oh, a bar crawl on Valentine's Day...
Is this about Nick's breakup with Kai?" No.
Yeah.
Now you might be asking yourself,
"Is attendance really mandatory?"
You bet it is.
Bar crawl!
Hmm...
He's about to cr*ck. We have to go tonight.
So I have news about a bar Cr...
Was I just out here talking to you guys about the bar crawl?
Did I already pitch it all to you?
Well, it's happening tonight!
Okay, so we h*t six bars in five hours.
Wait, wouldn't six hours make more sense?
Yeah, that'd make sense 'cause it all divides...
No, no, it doesn't, because it's... it's five hours.
Now, the amazing thing is, if you connect all the coordinates, the six bars form a perfect smiley face on the map... look.
You didn't actually connect all the coordinates.
Oh, my...
Winston: Hey, I think it is a really cool smiley face.
Thank you.
I got your back, man. I got your back.
Actually, I have all your backs, all right?
Uh, since I can't drink tonight, I am your designated buddy.
Here in my backpack, I have a list of items that we may need.
I got water, so...
I got towels for everybody.
Perfect.
I got... small stick.
Speaks for itself.
Oh.
Oh. Also... one female condom.
It's gonna go quick, so I'll let you two fight it out.
Cece: Uh-uh. Also, I got tissues for you, Nick, 'cause...
What for?
It's-it's Valentine's Day, and your girlfriend broke up.
You guys can be sad...
Move it right along, man.
Cool it. And the bar crawl starts... now!
Now!
(all cheering and whooping)
Actually, where's Schmidt?
Well, it's with a heavy heart...
(laughing): Oh! that we really must leave you.
We really must. He's too much. It was a pleasure.
Pleasure.
Easy on the puns, okay?
And you've got broccoli in your teeth.
Remember what I told you about eating at public functions?
Only use your back teeth.
Only use your back teeth.
Hey, Fawn, I'm sorry. We should probably get to Nick's bar crawl now, yeah?
You remember? I confirmed it like ten times with your intern.
Yes, yes, yes, no.
First, I need to, uh, schmooze some vascular surgeons.
Gotta get a discount on my spider vein removal. Okay?
Okay, ten minutes tops.
We're still going to dinner, 'cause it took a lot to get this reservation.
Also, we can't get wasted 'cause it's a very nice restaurant.
Which means we have to pretend to drink in front of Nick.
Is that really necessary?
Oh, yakkety-yakkety-yak.
Don't ruin my bar crawl.
Let's go. Drink.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Boom!
I'm gonna outdrink you tonight, Miller.
Cece, your mouth is writing a check that your body can't find. (Winston laughs)
That's not an expression.
Regionally specific to Northern Illinois.
We say it all the time.
Thank you, Winston.
You're welcome.
Don't write a check your body can't find.
(laughs) Every day, man.
For real.
Got to. Got to.
A gimlet for May.
Thank you.
Watch and learn, player.
If you're a girl and you're in a bar on Valentine's Day, you're basically saying, "Hello. Good February.
I'm interested in casual sex."
(chuckles) Hmm.
May, huh?
That's your name?
Yeah.
Ah, that's crazy 'cause, uh... (coughing loudly)
(clears throat, groans)
I know I just met you, but your name's already written... on my heart.
It's fate, baby.
It's fate... seriously?
Nick: All right, come on! Five-minute warning, let's go.
Dude, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Oh, no, nope, you're in the middle of nothing, because that's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.
(chuckles) She hates you, Ernie.
But I don't like her for you, anyway. Let's go.
Wait, what do you mean?
Ryan: I just don't know what to do. No schools are hiring.
I've contacted everyone I know.
I even checked through all my contacts in England, including my old headmaster at Wellington Prep, to see if he knew of anything in the States.
♪ Where there's a will, there's a ♪
♪ Wellington way. ♪ (giggles)
How do you know the Wellington fight song?
You sing it in your sleep.
Oh, God.
Look, don't worry, you're gonna find a job.
I'm just worried about not seeing you as much if I switch schools.
Well...
I'll just have to sleep over more.
Or you could move in with me.
Did the music just get louder?
(Nick whoops) The crawl rolls on and Winston's got the rear!
Let's go!
Cece: Let's go.
(whooping)
Winston: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go with the backpack in the back of the pack.
Hey, so listen, can't make the crawl. Bummed.
What?
But remember... tomorrow we have that photo sh**t, and I'm gonna need you to look as Mexican as possible, okay?
It's not okay. We should be together.
It's Valentine's Day.
Come on, you don't really care about Valentine's Day, do you?
I don't know, maybe I do.
Plus, you owe me.
I ran the teleprompter at your last debate... I made "Fawn is Fine" bumper stickers on my own dime.
Yeah.
Even krumped at that anti-g*ng initiative.
(hip-hop song playing)
Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that.
Me, too. The point is, Yeah.
I'm tired of always doing your things.
What do you want? You want a... You want a photo op?
Or do you want a boyfriend?
Call me when you know what you want.
Yeah, okay.

This bar completes the eyes on my smiley face.
Miller, man, it's just an honor to be on this bar crawl with you.
Just serving your vision.
Are you guys going on a bar crawl?
I just got dumped, so this holiday is really kicking me in the penis.
Me, too, man. Me, too.
It's been a real kick in the gooch.
Not anymore, it's not.
'Cause you're joining us.
Valentine's Day might be for couples, but the crawl is for all.
Yes. We just got our motto, folks.
All: The bar crawl is for all!
Good evening, happy Valentine's Day.
May I offer you a piece of my hear...?
Hey.
You again.
I'm curious, d-do you actually think that's gonna work?
I mean, you tell me.
(imitates heart pumping)
Are you trolling bars on Valentine's Day trying to find sad single girls to hook up with you?
I'm not gonna say yes, and I'm not gonna say no.
Because I know it would be a lie.
So yes.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take these.
Don't!
Yep.
Paid $3.50 for those.
You owe me $3.50.
I don't know, it's just such a huge step and so early in the relationship, and I thought that I could skip the question and come back to it later, which is the strategy I taught my S.A.T. prep course.
All right, let's do pros and cons.
Okay, pros... I love him.
I love his house, I love his accent.
When he says "raccoon" he says it like "rac-co*n."
Adorable.
Cons...
His toaster is super-old.
Woman: Ugh! I tried to stay out of this, but move in with him!
Yeah, well, I-I want to move in with him, but...
No "but," there's no damn "but."
No "but."
But... what if I blew it by pretending I didn't hear him?
Or maybe it wasn't that obvious.
Nah, she heard me, it was very obvious.
I really hate to see you upset.
You know, if I had something to g...
You know what, I do have something.
I have a bag of nuts in my bag.
Do you want a bag of nuts?
Nick: Maybe she didn't hear you.
You know, she's got a lot of hair.
Mm.
And hair blocks sound.
It happened when we were dating all the time.
Hey, did you get a chance to read my Walking d*ad fan fiction, yet?
What'd you think?
Well, here's the good news, lad.
We have a solution.
It's God's gift to man.
It's alcohol.
I can't.
We agreed to pretend-drink so we could go out to dinner.
Are you saying that 'cause you want me to go to jail for m*rder?
No.
No, 'cause I'm gonna m*rder you if you're pretend-drinking on my bar crawl!
And you're breaking my heart!
You can't fight the crawl.
It's like fighting a hurricane.
You know what a hurricane is?
Do you guys have those over the pond?
We don't, but I know what it is.
You guys don't have them?
No.
They're awful.
Mm-hmm.
It's like fighting one of those.
And a hurricane doesn't have fists, so just, bang, you lose!
Let's drink.
Yeah, man.
Yeah!
USA!
USA!
Yeah! - USA!
USA! (whoops)
And also where you're from!
Mmm.
To show respect.
Well, happy V-Day to me.
Fawn and I are on the rocks.
By the way, a pun that would have k*lled at last week's geologist ball.
(whispering): Let's m*rder her.
What?!
I want chicken wings.
I know.
How many drinks you had tonight?
Nine plus three minus one.
Oh, no. That's...
Because I'm gonna out-drink Miller.
You are gonna out-drink Miller? No one out-drinks Miller.
I do.
I guarantee you, you don't.
You don't know me.
Cece, Nick just got dumped, okay?
He has a depth of anger and sadness that rests between his eyes, and he can drink forever and ever and ever.
You'll lose every time.
Hey, it's my business partner that I was telling you about... Schmidt!
All: Schmidt!
Nick, who are all these people?
These are the crawlers.
The single, the lonely, the close-talkers, the shockingly pale, the t*nk-mouths, fat boys in the back... (whoops twice)
(crawlers whoop twice, in response) The chubby-fronts, the delusionally-okay with themselves... but no one is alone tonight because...
All (chanting): The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all!
I just want chicken wings.
Oh, you're hammered, Cece.
Hey.
Hey, Jess, I'm drinking f*re.
That seems dangerous.
Mm...
Um, I wanted to talk to you about what you said before.
What did I say? I can't remember.
You don't, you don't remember what you said?
No, I embraced the crawl.
Oh.
Winston and Nick: ♪ When it's cold outside ♪

Come on, now, don't be shy! I see you!
(boos, chuckles)
Oh, no.
Nick: And mic drop. Who's next?
No. What?!
No.
Damn it!
Are you following me?
No, I'm not following you, dude.
Do you have any nicer, sluttier friends?
Yeah, I do, and I'm never introducing them to you.
That's messed up.
And they're real dirty.
Aw!
Can I have a gimlet, please?
I.D.?
Seriously? Why?
'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.
(goofy laughing)
(snickering)
Oh...
(woman sighs) COACH: Ah.
Thank you.
You got a Kansas license.
That's where I learned to drive, and I have an emotional attachment to it, and I don't need to explain that to you.
No, you don't, but...
You're from Kansas?
Yup.
Well, I'm from all over. Army brat.
Me, too.
You are?
Yes.
Uh, you ever lived in North Carolina?
From 1989 to 1992.
I lived there in '93.
No.
You ever live in Germany?
Dusseldorf in '96!
Lived there in '97!
That's so weird.
So, we've, like, just missed each other for our entire lives.
And then we meet, like, three times in a row in one night.
(laughs) Seems a little weird.
It's kind of like, uh...
Fate?
No.
I know! I can't believe I said that!
Why did you say that?
That's so cheesy.
Oh, I hate that!
Nick: Hey, Coach!
Coach!
I don't know them.
I got a female condom if you need it, my man! (whoops)
Don't hold this against me, please.
Cece (groaning): Oh, God...
Here, Cece, have some water.
No, thank you. No.
Valentine's Day just sucks.
I don't know. I kind of like it.
Since when?
Since a few years ago... since three years ago, to be exact.
Oh, what happened three...?
Oh.
It was when you first took a chance on me.
And we humped until the sun came out.
Did all the things that R. Kelly raps about.
Yeah, I know. I was there.
It was the best night of my life, and ever since then, Valentine's Day has always been my favorite holiday, and I hope that you don't remember that I have said any of these things tomorrow.
Oh, it's gonna happen again.
It's gonna... Oh.
It's gonna happen again.
All right.
Oh...
(coughing)
Somehow, this isn't repulsive.
It's not great, but it certainly isn't the worst.
Jess: I'm so sorry that I pretended not to hear you.
It's just that... I wasn't ready for it, and sometimes you mumble with your accent, and I never fully understand you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I asked you to move in with me out of the blue.
What kind of... nutter does that?
The craziest mother nutter in the whole damn place!
Ryan Geauxinue, will you move in with me?
I have my own home.
You live in a loft with four guys and a urinal.
Will you move in with me?
Yes.
Yes?
Yes!
Yes!
Absolutely.
Yes!
Yes!
(giggles)
Nick: Home base! (groans)
Barkeep, bring us beer.
If you call me barkeep one more time, I'm shutting this bitch down.
Mike, I love you because you're gay... and 'cause you're dangerous.
I can't believe I used to have a crush on you.
(groans)
Hey, man. How's it going?
I'm not hooking up tonight.
I met one girl.
Several times.
She's pretty much perfect.
Nice. Where's she at?
I ditched her, dude.
She's, like, relationship material.
That's not what I'm looking for tonight.
Really?
Yeah, I want something easy.
Something easy?
Like Sunday morning.
Like Sunday morning. Know what I'm saying?
I know what you're saying.
That bitch is a Monday.
Know what I'm saying?
You know what's funny?
I got something just for that.
You're gonna love it. Here it is.
I can't wait.
Give it to me right...
Yo!
Go get that girl, dude.
(whining): I don't even know where she is.
I didn't h*t you that hard.
Hey. (grunts)
This, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing?
Yeah.
Not to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.
And I would know.
I have their biography here in my backpack.
I care about Schmidt, but just as a friend, all right?
Look me in the eyes, and tell me you don't have feelings for Schmidt.
I don't have feelings for him.
Dude, you are nowhere near my eyes.
Nobody h*t on me. I'm taken.
Don't talk to me. I'm a councilwoman.
Schmidt?
Did the whole crawl to find you.
I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm sober.
I'm wearing my strapless bra like a belt.
But I know what I want.
I want you.
I want you to be my boyfriend.
As much as a I want a commuter lane to Costa Mesa! (crowd whooping)
Vote Moscato!
(crowd cheering)
What?
They're kissing.
I thought maybe you were gonna say something like,
"No" or, like, "I miss him so much now."
Last call! (groans)
We got one more bar on the crawl!
We have to finish the smile!
You're never ever gonna make it.
And I'm never gonna ride a jet ski with Tom Colicchio on my back.
So, sometimes dreams just don't come true.
(shouting): I'm sorry about that guy Galecky not hugging you from behind in the water on a motorized thing... I'm sorry!
We will finish what we have started!
(cheering) Yay!
We will feast on the spoils of this night for a thousand moons!
In the name of love and booze!
(crawlers cheering)
Oh, no. My crush is back.
I hate myself.
(cell phone buzzes)
Oh, this person will not stop texting me.
Where is it? (phone continues buzzing)
Sorry.
Oh, it's an e-mail from Wellington Prep.
You do realize we were just about to have sex, right?
Say something to get back in the mood... say raccoon.
They're offering me the job of headmaster.
In England?
Raccoon?
So, you'd be the headmaster?
Headmaster.
Of Wellington?
Of Wellington.
(sighing): Headmaster.
Jess... look at me.
I'm not gonna take it.
Wellington's not even that great.
You have their current headmaster as your emergency contact.
Okay, it's heaven on Earth.
And I love it.
But I love you more.
Well, I love you, which is why I can't let you pass up this opportunity!
If we were ready to live in the same place, then we should be ready to live 5,000 miles apart.
Yeah, I suppose, but...
Well, I'll call you every night after work. It'll only be, like, midnight your time.
I could learn to stay up late. Maybe I should try cocaine!
Yeah! Or coffee!
That, too.
And I'll come and visit.
It's only, like, an 11-hour flight.
And then a four-hour drive to Wellington.
That's so long!
Which is great... 'cause I can catch up on podcasts.
We can do this!
We can do this long distance, right?
Right.
Nick (in distance): This is our revolution!
(crowd clamoring outside)
When I say bar, you say...
All: Crawl!
Bar!
Crawl!
Jess, are you guys coming or what?
Hi.
May!
May!
Hey.
You again.
Yeah.
Me again.
Look, um, I'm sorry about earlier.
I just, I-I really didn't plan on-on meeting somebody so great tonight, you know?
You messed everything up!
'Cause you're, like, awesome and that sucks because it's, like, that's not what I want. And you're pretty, which is a bummer.
'Cause it's, like, damn! She fine, but it's, like, at the same time, I'm, like, I don't need this in my life.
You wear a leather jacket...
I'm sorry. Are you... I'm just confused.
Are you trying to say something nice right now?
Yes. I am.
And I'm terrible at it.
Is there any way I could get, I ca... I, um...
I could get your number maybe?
(coughing)
Aw... (laughs)
A long number.
What the hell is this? Is this your e-mail address?
Write a good e-mail.
And I'll go out with you.
What...?
I'm talking full sentences.
I'm talking no typos.
No pictures. No pictures.
God, you are gonna make this really hard for me, huh?
Yes.
Aw...
You smell good.
Doug's Ale House!
The tip of the smile!
The crawl is complete! (crowd cheering)
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes! Get in!
(cheering, clamoring)
Hey!
Hey.
Everything okay? I'd spent a long time on the crawl, and now that it's over, it's just a natural sadness.
It's just gonna take a minute. Just go on in. It's fine.
What's the holdup? Nick's cracking a little bit.
Everybody, relax, okay?
It's just the crawl's over.
Kai is over.
I got nothing to do.
I just have nothing to do.
Come on.
Of course, you have so much to do.
Nick we're business partners, man.
We're teammates.
YOu're smart and talented guy.
And tonight we found out that you have a weird, _ charisma.
You should make more maps man. That's what you should do.
You're my idea-man.
Thank you guys.
Thank you for saying all this nice stuff.
I love you guys.
It's time to go inside. We got a crawl to finish.
Yeah. We got a crawl to finish.
Now out of my way, I'm getting another drink.
I can't let you in.
You're not wearing shoes.
Where are you shoes, Nick?
Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.
Everybody's waiting for you.
I can't go into the bar. I don't shoes on.
My map is just a deformed smile now. I didn't complete it.
Or is it?
A goatee face.
What bar is that?
What bar is that?
(chuckles)
I'm glad you asked.
Welcome to Winston's bar.
Hot stuff Aww Happy Valentine's day, everybody.
That's right.
You know how a computer is this big.
What if a computer was... this big?
The size of a man's hand.
And had a camera in it, and you can take self pictures, and it also had a phone.
So you can store the *
Kind of a good idea.
***
This makes me impatient.
And it makes me also so furious.
I need... 45 minutes away from you.
And then we can be best friends again.
Don't follow me out.
(grunts)
So, as you guys know, Schmidt and I are business partners.
We've been working on an idea we're very excited about.
We e-mailed our plans to a guy in China, and the prototype is here.
And... we've got a pitch meeting set up with Lori Greiner.
From QVC?
That the one.
That's right.
You know, Fawn and I were paired with her in a charity golf tournament.
You know, they laughed at me for playing the ladies' tees, but it paid off.
She's a shark.
Ha! A shark golfing.
(whoops) Now I'd buy that T-shirt.
Friends, imagine yourself in this scenario.
You're at the local gymnasia.
Oh...
You're<i> schvitzing</i> up a storm.
Suddenly, you get a text message.
There's an emergency wedding down at the town hall.
But what'll I wear? I mean, I'm sweating at the gym.
Huh, I don't know what's going on. I love this.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you...
Game time.
The Swuit!
The Swuit!
Ugh.
The Swuit. The Swuit.
It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.
Well?
This is it?
What do you guys think?
This looks like garbage. It looks like garbage.
I don't think it looks like... relax.
Nick, it looks like garb...
It's embarrassing. Put it away.
The bottoms aren't great, but the top...
Well, I like it.
I mean, I like you guys.
All right, I'm gonna go throw this out.
No, don't throw it away!
Why, you want to wear it?
(laughing): No.
No, no, no, no.
No.
(Coach and Jess laughing)
He said, "Do you want to wear it?"
Jess: No, I just...
I think... I was gonna put it in the Goodwill bin at school.
As lining for the bottom.
Get rid of it. It's a piece of crap.
We're-we're screwed.
Guys, you're starting a business.
There are gonna be some setbacks.
We don't have enough time, okay?
I'm running out of vacation days, and our pitch meeting with Lori is on Friday.
Friday?! (laughs)
You never told me Friday. He never told...
Guys...
I told you a hundred times it was on Friday.
That sounds like it could be right, yeah.
Could be Friday. Yeah.
Now we need another good idea in four days.
Ah, I can't work under pressure like this.
You know that I get nervous.
I am just a man. I am not a god.
Uh, I think we're all aware of that.
Why you talking like that?
Like what?
(imitating Schmidt): Well, we're all aware of that.
Guys, stop fighting!
You're upsetting Winston.
It's so early.
You made me swallow my night guard.
Oh, please, it's a paperclip with gum wrapped around it.
We're in a crunch.
Good morning!
Made you guys some brain food.
Nick: Ah, thank you.
I'm supposed to hang out with Kai later and do nothing. This'll help.
No time. The pitch is on Friday.
(groans) I'm gonna need one good idea every 20 seconds.
Ugh.
Oh, you're gonna time me now?
Yes.
It'll help you concentrate.
(retro-electronic music playing)
It's too beepy-boppy.
Well, it's brain music.
Go.
Look away.
(whispering): This is exciting.
I feel like I'm in the garage at Cupertino.
This sounds like the video in middle school that taught me about periods.
And time!
All right.
Let's see what you got.
"I am the Karduthian champion of... of dance."
"Beer bread."
Beard bread.
Bread that is in your beard.
That's an... that's an invention?
Or is that just something that happens to you?
You think Hewlett had to put up with this crap from Packard? Again.
Oh, now I'm Packard? Enough!
You can't come up with a good idea being all loosey-goosey.
Why don't you tell that to Howard Hughes, the inventor of the<i> Loose Goose?</i>
That was the<i> Spruce Goose,</i> and it didn't work!
It did work!
It flew for over a mile at an altitude of 72 feet!
How on Earth do you know that information and not know the name of it?
I don't want to stick my nose in someone else's rose, but what I'm hearing is two very passionate partners with two totally different approaches.
You h*t the nail right on the head!
That is a correct assessment of what is going on right now.
And thank you for breakfast!
I'm gonna shove this bacon right in my mouth and savor it for life.
That omelette was so delicious!
You know what, you guys are saying really nice things to me, but you're both shouting...
Such a delicious omelette!
The presentation's fantastic!
One of the most delicious things I've ever had.
You've outdone yourself.
Definitely appreciated!
Don't follow me.
Don't follow me!
All they care about is who's the boss.
Of course that's all they care about, Jess.
It's a guy thing. It's in our DNA.
Look, Nick's not gonna let Schmidt boss him around, and vice versa.
Don't get me started on the male power dynamic.
I will talk your ear off.
They're being such dudes right now.
It's, like, all about who's got the bigger you-know-what.
Oh, I do know what. (both laugh)
Yeah. Yeah.
What can we do to make them collaborate?
You can eliminate their you-know-whats. (chuckles)
That was a joke.
You want to hang out tonight and have ninja turtle sex?
What's ninja turtle sex?
Sex with backpacks on.
(laughs): Oh, sex with backpacks on!
Yes, I would love to, but I can't.
I got to do some work, or Schmidt will put me in the "Think Harder" box, which is basically just a refrigerator box that he hits with a baseball bat.
Gets me to think harder.
Talk later?
Yeah.
Great.
I really hope that you enjoyed your service today, and please come back...
Okay.
Thanks a lot, big spender.
You should probably show some clavicle.
No. I need bigger tips.
They're raising my college tuition, and if I don't come up with the money by Friday, I got to drop out.
So I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Wow, Cece, look.
I mean, we're your friends.
If you want, I can give you money.
Coach (mumbling): You can give her money.
I ain't giving her a damn thing...
I think what Coach is trying to say is that he will also give you money.
Look, that's very sweet, but the last thing I want is charity, okay?
And don't tell Jess, because she just goes nuts anytime she thinks I need money.
So I don't think I can afford to go home for my aunt's birthday.
You need money? I'm selling my hair!
Oh! Hi. Hello!
You're a handsome fella.
Can I interest you in a drink or...
Oh, you suck!
We got to do something.
Winston, for the first time in my life, I'm not 100% broke, and you want me to give my money away?
No, sir.
She said she didn't want charity.
I ain't giving it to her.
Oh, crap.
Am I stuck doing another thing with you again?
It's a classic Winston and Coach mess-around!
(both laugh)
All right. But don't say that.
What if I put your name first?
Let me hear it.
It's a classic Coach and Winston mess-around.
Regardless, I don't like it.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Schmidt.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Nick.
Well, you know what, he's got a real head full of dog dirt.
Mm.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Schmidt.
He's a bossy old tuna.
Well, we both know you are the boss.
Thank you.
But we both know he's not the boss.
Exactly.
Maybe you could back off a little, since Nick's been having, you know, man problems.
"Man problems"?
Man problems.
Huh.
Are we talking clog or leak?
He's got the wet Tuesdays?
You think it's 'cause of his tight denim pants?
Did the squirrels get to the tulip bulbs?
Mm-hmm.
And that's why you have to make him feel like he's the boss right now.
Yeah, of course. It's the least that I could do.
Well, I had no idea Schmidt had a cranky dank.
So, yeah, I'll let him be the boss.
(whispering): I'm amazing.
What?
I'm amazing.
What?
What? Huh?
What? Hmm?
Hmm, this is a bit of an unprecedented group, the three of us.
This isn't a social call, young lady.
Oh.
This is strictly business.
Here's the deal.
You need money for college.
No. No, okay?
I am not a charity case.
This isn't charity.
No. No, we've gone through this.
This is an investment.
Nick and Schmidt are looking for investors, so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing, too.
You're smart, you're driven.
We are confident in a very robust ROI.
ROI means "Return On Investment."
I know what it stands for.
I've been reading a lot of Schmidt's investment books in the toilet.
Life hack: the toilet paper makes for a very, very handy bookmark.
Life hack: read your phone on the toilet like everybody else.
Ooh.
The answer is gonna be no, all right?
Because when you borrow money from friends, things get weird...
N-N-No, do not mistake this for friendship, young lady, all right?
As far as I'm concerned, you're just a walking treasury bond.
Within three years of graduation, you will pay us back in full, plus ten percent of the principal.
I really don't want to do this. At all.
But...
There's always a "but," huh?
But I don't really have any other choice.
Yes!
You were right, man.
So I guess we're in business, boys.
Yes.
We wrote the check out to Cece.
We do not know your full name.
This is looking really good.
It's absolutely stunning.
This is... this is your vision from start to finish.
I might be the seed, but you're the farmer.
Hey, you two look like you're really getting along.
Yeah, well, you know what, who wouldn't get along with this brave, masculine, healthy cowboy?
What you got there?
It's a camera attachment.
That keeps the attention of your dog while you're taking its picture.
Oh.
Schmidt came up with a great title for it.
It's called "Perfect Pet Pic."
This is just a prototype that dumb-old me came up with.
If he put it together, it'd be a lot better, I promise you that.
Now, of course, could-could you just hold some pet food in your other hand? Sure.
But this is a lifestyle product.
That's actually really impressive.
I think Lori's gonna like that.
You know, I had a vision of what this product would look like.
And you carried it out and exceeded my expectations in a way that... I don't know.
It-it's touching.
Sometimes I feel like you're my arms.
I'm really proud of the way that you're handling this.
I'm proud of the way that you've handled this.
What have I handled?
Y-Your man problems.
No, honey, you're the one with the man problems.
I don't have the man problems. I'm being so nice to you because you're the one who has the man problems.
No, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only being nice to you 'cause you have man problems, and I feel sorry...
No, you have man problems and that's why I'm being nice to you right now.
Honey, honey, honey...
What man problems did you think I had?
Something hangy.
Hang...? You think I had something hanging off...
What'd you think I had?!
I don't want to get too graphic, but I... I was picturing something gooey.
Gooey's not the worst... I've had gooey.
Oh, good God, what?
Simply ignore it.
Who told you about my man problems?
Who told you about my man...?
Look, the only reason why I did this was to get you guys to stop arguing about who's the boss...
Don't you be sorry! Jess, you did nothing wrong!
You're nothing but an angel!
You tried to help us, which is a sweet move!
You tried to help a situation...
You're yelling nice things at me again! which was at a boiling point.
It's very confusing!
Nick: This is his fault!
He's been bossing me around for ten years!
If I hadn't been bossing you around, you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas and the ambition of a d*ad person.
I will never let you boss me around again.
Not even if the lives of 100,000 children depended on it.
Fine, if-if... I take that part back.
If a bunch of kids' lives depended on it, I'd let you boss me around.
You went way too far in that moment.
Fine, but you understand my point.
If there were five kids whose life depended on it, I wouldn...
Not even five kids.
Okay, I... No kids, I don't... Pretend I...
Just take the kids out.
I understand the point you're trying to make!
The company is d*ad! That's the point.
I'm going to that pitch meeting tomorrow with Lori Greiner without you.
You know why? Because a boss never breaks appointments.
You think I was born in the middle of the afternoon?
You're gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit?
Fine, go to that pitch together, and then me and you, we're done.
Fine, I'm done with you.
Don't speak to me until bedtime.
If you think we're gonna have a bedtime chat, you're out of your mind.
We'll lay in beds, and we'll just over the day together like we usually do and that's it!
No.
Fine, we'll do that for a little bit. That's it.
That's it.
Here, take it. I don't even need it anymore.
Bedtime chat's gonna be so short, you won't believe it.
Schmidt: Oh, I'll believe it.
You won't believe it.
Thought you might not show.
I drove you here, Nicholas.
Let's just get through this thing, and then we can be done with each other, okay?
Okay.
And, by the way, stay out of my way in there.
I'm about to blow the roof off of this thing with a little something I like to call the "Seven S's."
I bet you don't have any more than four.
Yeah? Watch me.
Go ahead.
Strategy, sizzle, Schmidt, sex...
Go on.
Stop interrupting me. I got... I got more.
Salesmanship.
Something.
Synergy.
Boom. Nailed it.
Damn it.
That's seven... How you like me now?
All right, that's really good, but it's not gonna matter,
'cause the only thing that matters is what I have.
A prototype.
So stay out of my way in there, and let me just show her the prototype, because that's all we need.
(chuckles)
We don't need a prototype.
Did you forget the prototype?
No.
Did you forget the prototype?
(laughs): No.
Did you forget the prototype?
Yeah.
Where'd you leave it, Nick?
I still believe in them though.
Part of me thinks that even though they're mad at each other, they'll get in there, and they'll figure it out.
I don't think that's the case.
Why are you being so negative?
'Cause they left their stupid thing.
What?!
Oh, crap.
♪ I'm delivering a prototype ♪
♪ And drinking a big coffee... ♪
(tires screech, horns honking)
Oh, crap.
Nick, what is the matter with you?
Well, I wouldn't have forgot it if you didn't bully me to get out of the house an hour early!
It was too fast! I needed time!
You lay on the ground...!
You guys ready?
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Absolutely.
I'm talking about postwar.
That's after the w*r.
Prewar would be something different completely.
I was in London postwar, post-postwar, in '77, and, uh... I caught a few shows.
The flights were... Well, I think I spent two... maybe $250 to get to... (quietly): Guess who?
What are you doing here?
I'm just checking in on my investment.
Oh, my... Hey, check it out.
I'm a campus cutie.
No, you are not.
What are we learning?
Shh!
I am studying Postwar British Art History.
What?
Post Br-British who? What's that?
That's just a bunch of words that mean "Screw you, investors." What else you taking?
Intro to Afrikaans.
What else? Astronomy 101? (chuckles)
That's next semester.
Winston: Wow.
What you gonna do, Cece, join the South African space program and be the first woman to put a David Hockney painting on the moon?
Who is David Hockney?
Excuse me, can I help you?
No, no, we're okay, sorry.
Yes, can you please, um, tell my investment here We're okay, we're... that she can't make any money with art history.
That's not true.
Last year I made almost $22,000, and my life is very hard.
You see that? You should be studying to become a doctor.
They make good money, they get respect.
Paging Dr. Cece.
A doctor? We wouldn't see a penny for at least 12 years.
Here's what you should be focused on, okay?
Something with a low risk, high reward, and that thing...
Do not say hotel management.
Hotel management.
Oh, my gosh.
Look, man, it is a secure living and it's great way to meet people.
Do you mind... telling me where I might find more information on hotel management?
Uh, the dog, uh... the dog...
You put the food in the thing.
Uh, and then the dog sees it, and, uh, the food's dangle-dang... uh, it's dangling.
To, uh, do-do-do...
Dog...
Looks at dang-dang.
Tail wag-wag, uh, rev... dog wagging the ta...
Um, whatever dog's name is.
Dog's name is Claire.
Claire come in.
Who-who's Claire?
Shh.
Uh, Claire sees dog food.
Pic, Facebook, like, like, like...
Sizzle... Pet Pic... strategy, sex, something.
Strategy, sex, something.
S-Something.
Something.
This is the worst pitch I have ever seen.
(panting): Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.
Gentlemen, your prototype.
Wait, what are you wearing?
This? (chuckles)
This is the Swuit!
It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.
It was invented by Nick and Schmidt, and like them, it's the perfect combination.
That one over there, he's all creativity and ideas.
Thoughts and notions.
And this one's all data and numbers.
Six.
He can just keep going.
The Swuit goes from day to night and night to play.
Schmidt: Take my friend Nick here for example.
I mean, this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding.
I now pronounce me comfortable.
(chuckles)
Look, Lori, you get it.
Look, Lori, you get it.
Lori, you get it.
Do it together.
Both: No one doesn't love the Swuit.
Don't settle for substitutes.
Swettle for swub-si-swuits.
No?
I've got to stop drinking on the golf course.
To the Swuit!
All: The Swuit!
Hey, how'd it go?
She like the Perfect Pet Pic?
Even better.
She hated the Swuit.
Yeah, she's got a similar product on QVC called the Scruit.
It's a suit made of scrubs.
It was developed for prison weddings.
Yeah, paid us $10,000 to k*ll the Swuit.
Yeah!
Yeah!
So, Nick, are you finally free to do nothing?
Not so fast there, lady.
Uh, old Schmidty-bangs and I have to get working on our next idea.
That is, if you'll still have me, buddy.
Come on, man.
Of course I'll have you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I was looking at you the whole time. Don't say anything.
When I say that, just let me say that and take a moment where you're like,
"Wow, he's about to say something."
You kept... you kept saying it as if I wasn't looking at you.
Nick: But what I'm clearly doing is saying, "Look at me."
And what you're supposed to do is be like, "Ah."
And then I'm gonna say something.
Ah.
Look at...
L-Let me say it first.
All right, guess what? (clicks tongue) Gone.
Now. We back?
Of course, man. (chuckling)
Come here.
Ah, come on.
Come on.
Come on, come here.
Come on.
Come here.
Come here.
Just meet in the middle.
Dynamic duo.
Dynamic duo.
Batman and Robin.
Yeah, I'm Batman.
I'm Batman, for sure.
Jess: You guys just made ten grand.
What are we doing drinking booze that you didn't buy?
Let's go.
Yeah!
Let's do it, all right!
Yeah!
Hey, can we talk for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
(groans)
Wow, that is some serious shade.
I guess we deserve that.
Yep.
Cece, look, I know I got carried away with the whole investing thing.
So...
I'm sorry.
Ooh, an Afrikaans dictionary.
Yeah, it was not easy to find.
Read the inside cover.
"Whatever drawings you talk about, always sh**t for the stars.
Winston and Coach."
It's very sweet, guys. Thank you.
That makes zero sense.
I know, it makes no sense.
All: Hey!
Huzzah!
Nick Miller, friend, businessman.
This one's for you.
("Taking Care of Business" begins)
What is she doing now?
I think she's making herself some tea.
Hey.
Hey.
What's up? Are you okay?
Kai broke up with me.
No.
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry. What happened?
She said she wants to be with somebody who can just sit on the couch all day.
She said I'm too ambitious; she said I work too hard.
(stifled laughter)
Nah, it was the... It's not funny.
It's just that when you said that out loud, it made me laugh.
I'm really sorry about Kai.
She seemed like a great girl, but on the bright side, in all your years on this planet, has anyone ever dumped you for working too hard?
No. (chuckles)
No, it's mostly 'cause I'm either too poor or too sticky.
So this is a big day then.
For the first time in my life, I really want to do something with this, you know?
I really want to make this business work.
Schmidt, tomorrow, let's start bright and early, 7:00 a.m.
No, no, no, Nick, I want to do it your way.
Let's wake up at 12:00 noon.
Just said your way.
Hey, guys, how about 9:30?
Now that's a genius right there.
9:30, let's say 9:30.
Let's meet in the middle.
What's that book?
Oh, nothing, it's not even a...
General artifact.
They're giving out books at the bar now for kids.
What is it, seriously?
It's mine.
Winston and Coach gave it to me.
They're helping me with money for my tuition.
You need money?
No, it's gonna be fine. Jess...
Oh my God. I'm selling my car.
No Je... No, no. It's gonna be...
It's gonna be fine, OK?
***
(grunts)
Not a fan.
k*ll me... please.
The worst.
Now we taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
And working overtime. Work it out.
***
You're right, you're right. Calm down.
What in the hell is around your neck?
This? It's a crystal charm, man.
Yeah, the guys at work gave it to me.
Why?
Technically, it's "hazing," but, uh, I secretly love it.
That is the kind of crystal that should only rest between a set of old bosoms.
(yawps)
Did that sound just come from your body?
(yawps)
Hey!
Ha!
Whoa, how long you two been here?
When was the last time you asked me that?
Last Thursday.
So, at least Thursday.
What kind of lazy... (yawps) holes...
Don't you know what (yawps)-ing day it is?
For crying out l... (yawps)
Glen, you should see a doctor.
My name is Schmidt.
And I can't afford to miss work.
I'm sorry, Glen, but I'm with Kai on this one.
Thanks, Wilfred.
You ain't good with names.
Oh, honey, you're all turned around.
No, you are.
I think you are.
I think you are, I'm gonna get you...
(giggles) Stop.
I've done some research.
Oh, ooh, how about a head's up, man?
Have I seen those glasses before?
I feel like I want to remember them.
I got these in seventh grade, and I love them.
Stop asking questions.
All right, check it.
So nerd Coach went to the library, and some place that actually exists called the Hall of Documents.
The downtown branch?
Mm-hmm.
How's Kathleen's eye?
Oh, Kathleen's d*ad.
What?
Yeah.
So, check it out, guys, this is all research.
You two don't have to date in secret anymore at school.
Yeah, it's all here in the Lipinski v. Platte County Unified School District.
Precedence for days!
Wow. Wow, you did this for us.
No.
I just want to pat it.
I just want to, like, frickin' pat it.
I want to nurse it.
Yeah, I want to provide it with milk.
Huh.
I used to be the hot teacher.
Now you know how I felt when you turned up.
A miserable path awaits you.
So you want us to come out, so that you can go back to hooking up with all the hot teachers?
Very much so.
But I'm thinking about you guys, too.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if you didn't have to hide your relationship?
Yeah, you know what?
I think we should do this.
I... we should do this, let's stop hiding.
Yeah.
But, Jess, will this make things tricky for your work and will it in turn make you distracted and preoccupied during our splishy-splashy?
Ugh.
No, no, of course not, I won't let it.
Then let's do this.
Yeah, let's.
Yes! We are coming out!
Cracking. I'm chuffed.
Dude, I do not get you.
I trust you, Miss Day.
Mostly because I do not want to read this.
That's great!
(laughs) Well, Yay!
I'm the easy one, dawg.
Seriously, it's the teachers you need to worry about.
Especially you.
You tend to care what people think about you.
(chuckles) That's like saying a penguin "tends" to be cute.
It's all it does, bro.
(chuckles)
So, good luck when the teachers present their field trip proposals.
If they catch a whiff of favoritism, they are going to tear you apart like... like a beautiful baguette, you know what I mean?
When you-you're having dinner, and you just suddenly say, "Hey, forget the bread Kn*fe.
Let's just rip into this with our bare hands."
Ah, I love that.
Hey, what'd they say? What do you got?
You can tell me, I can take it.
I-I don't know if I can take it if...
If you d*ed, I'd be lost.
J-Just tell me, I'll be there for you, I'm big and strong.
Is it cancer?
What's your problem?
Oh, Schmidty, you have cancer?
I can't watch you go through cancer, buddy, you're not strong enough.
What is wrong with you?!
Your friend keeps forgetting his ulcer medication.
Ulcer medication?
He's lying, please.
Take him home, make sure he does nothing all day.
Look, I'm not doing nothing all day.
Can't take days off wo...
My firm is wooing red potatoes, and I want that account.
Don't listen to that aggressive male nurse.
He's wearing the same shoes as an old Russian woman.
It's not an ulcer, he's ly... (yawps)
Yeah, that's your ulcer telling you to stop being a dick.
(groans)
Before we begin our presentations, in the spirit of full disclosure and transparency, I have something to tell you.
Mr. Geauxinue and I are dating.
No, n-n-n-no.
(laughs)
I just felt someone pass over my grave.
Right.
I don't see a ring.
This is a total joke.
Oh, you're joking.
There's none scenarios that this is possible.
Coach: Ladies, I know you're upset, but you know what I do when I'm upset?
I hook up with me.
But I want to assure you that this will not affect my judgment as vice principal.
Let's hear those field trip proposals!
Where are we gonna take those kids, guys?!
And you know what makes the water delicious?
Taking the poop out.
Hello, water treatment plant.
Okay, we're off to a rocky start.
They've got frickin' mini-golf.
They've got frickin' Skee-Ball.
They've got frickin' bumper boats.
They've got frickin' go-carts.
Is this you topless in the brochure?
It is, thank you.
Take a trip to historical Coach-town.
Lunch will be provided.
I don't eat yesterday's bread.
Yes, you do.
Is there a field trip in here somewhere?
I want to take the children on an interactive nature "experience."
Very hands on.
With, uh, "foll-ahge"...
"foil-iag-ee"...
Not bad, um, I'd be a lot more into it if you could pronounce foliage.
I messed it up!
Can't do anything!
So I've arranged for our students to speak to astronauts at the space station, uh, via Russian translator.
And, as an added surprise, actually get to operate the Mars rover.
You see, this is...
"Mission to Mars: Field Trip to Another World."
Jess: Okay, then.
(toy engine revs)
Well, you all had great presentations, but I'm sure no one can accuse me of favoritism when I choose Mr. G's proposal which was so, so, so clearly the best one.
(booing)
Ruth: What does space have?
You can't even walk on the ground.
You obviously picked it because he's your frickin' boyfriend.
Well...
Biology teacher: I see how it is.
My butt isn't cute enough... Should I call my ma and blame her for passing on her wide flat ass?
(imitates dialing phone)
Hello, Ma?
I'm not calling about that.
Just listen.
I said... just listen.
It's about my butt.
Should I continue?
I'm gonna say no.
You won't frickin' get away with this.
Eat glass and die, you tramp!
Mrs. Raws!
Uh, you're not going to work.
What are you talking...?
You're not going to work.
Yes, I'm going to work!
Sit down! Sit down!
Of course I'm going to work.
Gina needs me.
Besides, I like my stomach like I like my suits... no lining.
Here, take your bottoms off, put these sweatpants on.
You take your bottoms off, sir!
Why don't you take your slacks off, so I can put some sweatpants on? Now take your bottoms off.
I'm not gonna sit around here all day like an off-duty ice cream truck driver!
I confiscated three laptops, two tablets and an e-reader.
Oh, and this satellite phone with a condom taped to it.
My earthquake kit?
Hey, look... for starters, Schmidt, you're sitting up way too straight.
I feel like I'm sitting just fine.
Take a deep breath...
Inhale it all the way in...
Now...
(whispering): let it go.
(exhales)
Now let go.
(exhales)
Now let go...
I... I am letting go.
You're like a clenched fist, my man. Open up.
You're in a 1920s boxing stance.
This is a waste of time!
You're not going to work!
I have a hyperactive nephew!
We have to swaddle him!
Swaddle nothing! What?
What are you doing?!
Swaddle him! Get him!
Gotta get to work!
Shh.
Shh...
Shh... you relaxed?
Yeah.
Okay, ready?
You're gonna lay down.
All right, just for a minute.
♪ Good night, Schmidty. ♪
(sighs)
(whispering): Now do me.
Okay.
(whispering indistinctly)
Hey, what's up, girl?
Hey, uh... remember when we used to do it and it was dope?
Nah.
Nah? What you talk...?
You still like Ryan?
Well...
It's just the accent. That's the only thing that you...
You like the accent. I can do an accent.
(bad Cockney accent): Ah can do an accent.
You like when I do this accent, eh?
You like when I do the accent?
Not at all.
(bad accent): My dad makes cheese...
He just made me realize that I want guys who have, like, frickin' feelings and stuff.
Yeah, well...
But the boy looks like he was raised in a muffin.
Oh. Hey.
I've been holding office hours all year and this is the first time anyone's taken me up on it.
Ryan took you up on it, didn't he?
(teachers gasp, laugh)
This is gonna be fine and, um, I'm going to address all of your problems one by one.
It just ain't right.
Okay.
"Ain't... right."
Anything else?
It's not okay.
"Not... okay."
What else?
I'm not all right with it.
And when you lent me that sweater last week, was I supposed to, like...
Ruth!
It's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.
If you two are coming out, we are, too.
Meet my boyfriend.
So you like teachers?
I'd do whatever it takes to get my foliage trip off the ground.
And now I know how things work around here.
And you're not even my type, just so you know.
♪ Ba-da-da ♪
Don't do that.
I'd be way more into this if you had, like, a classic Latin build.
Okay, stop. Stop!
'Cause I'm a ginger?
Just get out.
(teachers murmuring)
Ms. Day!
(clamoring)
Okay!
I changed my mind.
We're gonna look at foliage.
Now, will that make you people go back to your jobs?
Yeah.
(murmuring agreement)
I won something.
I won something.
Hey.
What's going on?
Everybody was just so mad at me. I feel terrible. This is my fault.
Jess, maybe I should look for another job.
No! No! Absolutely not.
No, look, I have everything under control.
I am 100% confident that I'm making the right decision.
Winston: You got girl troubles, get a crystal.
Look, I'm telling you, Coach, women have been checking me out all day.
From the gentleman across the bar.
This is my favorite drink.
How did he...?
Something powerful told me it was.
Now, they gave me this crystal to help me on the streets, but I'm starting to think it's gonna help me in the sheets.
Winston, look at me. Mm-hmm.
And I have never been more serious about anything in my life.
Okay.
Stop rhyming.
All the timing?
I don't need a crystal, I just need to be more frickin' sensitive, so stop trying to give me your crystal!
Okay. I'm not supposed to be yelling.
That's what I'm...
I need to be working... I need to work on that.
I'm telling you, man, this crystal gives you the courage to do the one thing that you're scared of the most.
To me, it's country music line dancing.
Well, that is terrifying.
Don't do that.
You guys seen Schmidt?
What the hell?
My word processor?
You can't Kathy Bates me forever!
My work needs me. Gina needs me.
I'm sorry, but she's trying to k*ll you and I'm trying everything in my power to stop her.
No, you're trying to turn me into you.
Aren't you bored, Nick?
I've been doing nothing for exactly one day and I already feel pathetic.
The Nick that I met in college would not be happy living like this.
You've changed.
That's not true. I've always been lazy.
Physically, yes. But ment*lly, you used to be like a da Vinci in tie-dye.

(clears throat)
Well, I'll be.
Think differently.

Awesome, bro.
Ha!
Party!
Well, you changed, too.
You used to live by your own rules.
You were like a fat, Jewish Dennis Rodman.
But look at you now.
You're like the back of a horse in a two-person horse costume with Gina just farting in your face all day long.
That actually happened.
What?!
Schmidt, tell me, what do you get for all your hard work?
The sponge account.
Oh, great!
God willing, it'll get me red potatoes, too.
Sexiest starch since jasmine rice.
Great.
I hope your work keeps making you walk around with your guts in a rusty old wagon.
(computer begins playing '80s techno song)
Oh, hey, Nick. You're up early.
Before noon.
Oh, wait, is this Sleepwalk Nick?
Man, I love Sleepwalk Nick!
He always pays back the money that Awake Nick borrows from me.
Of course I'm up! I'm doinstuff.
I do stuff. I clean.
I'm cooking right now. I'm cooking breakfast.
Sun's up, Miller's up. People say that.
Huh. Oh, hey, Coach.
You're dressed like Ryan.
What?
(laughs)
No, you see, I-I... I've had these clothes for forever, I just don't wear them when you're around.
You are dressed like Ryan!
Are you around me all the time? No.
Dressing up like someone else isn't going to work.
Unlike this crystal...
Shut up.
And I am never taking this crystal off.
Well, I mean, except if I'm making a tomato sauce and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce.
Then I'll take it off, and that's just being practical.
I don't know too much about crystal care, but, oh, I intend to find out.
Jess: See?
I made the right decision.
Kids need to be in nature.
Emily Kopnik saw a butterfly and she said, "Oh, my God, country lice can fly."
Oh, cool.
Well, I'm sensitive and I care about things like that.
Do you like leaves, Eddie?
No.
Me, too, buddy. Me, too.
So rake 'em into a observational mound... or "a pile"... and then we transfer the piles into one of these special research bags which you kids can take home.
Hey.
What's happening here?
Here's another rake.
You're not just having the kids, uh, rake the leaves and put them in a bag, are you?
What now?
I mean, do, uh... what else do you have planned?
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm a... biology professional.
So, how's that phantom ulcer treating you?
I sent you those Q4 reports...
Horrible burning!
Well, I'm glad you're back.
See? Look how glad I am.
Gina, let me run point on red potatoes.
I've got three pitches already ready to rock.
Here's a taste.
That's the first one.
That's the first pitch. "Here'a taste."
It's just a picture of a red potato, and the tagline is: "Here's a... here's a taste."
There's that New York sense of humor again, Schmidt.
Come on, Gina. Give me a sh*t at red potatoes.
No way, 'cause I need you.
You're the best sort of mid-level employee I've ever had.
You are the ass to my horse.
And I'm gonna keep you right here, right by my side, where I can find you.
Forever.
Forever?
Yeah, speaking of... Forever?
Yeah, speaking of... might need you to suit up for my son's birthday this Saturday, so...
What are these? Doesn't matter.
Keep your phone on, okay?
You know, sometimes I think about life, and it just makes me want to cry.
Respond to my sharing, please.
You're putting on a real creepy, m*rder vibe today.
Just FYI.
I'm not trying to do that. I was...
Just, like, going forward in your day, you should know that.
Just trying to be, like, feeling...
Hey, guys.
Hi.
What's going on?
Ruth: I think they might just be doing frickin' yard work.
Kids: ♪ I don't know ♪
♪ What I been told ♪
♪ I don't know what I been told ♪
Coach: Whoa.
♪ Foster's butt is mighty old ♪
♪ Foster's butt is mighty old ♪
Oh, we're violating every child labor law.
They're really good singers.
Keep up the rhythm. Mama won't be happy till you clear the back forty.
Biology teacher?
Is this your house?
Did you bring the kids here to work?
First of all, my name is Lorenzo.
Secondly, yes.
But you're the one who picked my trip, so it's your fault.
Boy: Can I have some water?
Okay, guys, stop working.
Don't listen to her. Keep working.
You don't have to work.
I'm the vice principal.
Not technically at school, so keep working.
Stop working!
Keep working!
(buzzing)
(screams)
(all gasping)
Wasps! Everybody stay calm!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're getting in my eyes.
Aah! Damn you bees!
Ah! They got me!
Ah, screw it.
Here comes me.
I sting too, bees.
Bees don't bother me.
Seems like it was a great field trip.
So sorry I missed it.
I feel like a bunch of tiny people are holding tiny little lighters to my face.
(groans loudly)
Today was a complete and total disaster, from start to finish.
I've never failed so hard at my job ever in my life.
Everyone's so mad at me, but I was just trying to make them happy.
Jess, you can't make everyone happy.
Coach: You don't need them to like you.
You just need them to listen to you.
You're the boss.
Cece: Yeah.
I mean, if you were a man dating someone at work, do you think that you would be worried about what everyone else was thinking?
Coach: You'd be, like, in the conference room, like, "Meeting adjourned.
Except for you, Sheila."
But that's not me.
I care what people think. I always have.
Then your only option is to go in and be yourself.
Just got to own it.
I think I'm a little scared.
Well, that's very interesting. You see...
Have you been here this whole time?
The entire time.
That is why God... made crystals.
Why did he make that shirt?
Hey.
Hey, look, Nick, I got to talk to you.
I got to talk to you.
You go first.
You go first.
Okay, you know what? You were right, Nick.
I am a corporate monkey.
I don't want to be an old man looking back on a meager life of... selling red potatoes for the man.
I don't want to be a lazy bum my whole life.
I want to be the kind of bum that other bums look at and say, "What's that bum smiling about?"
I get that.
I just had an idea, Schmidt.
I just had an idea, too, but I feel like it's stupid.
I feel like mine's stupid. Let's do it.
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
But I want to hear what you have to say.
It's important to me... 'Cause maybe it's the same thing, maybe it's different.
It might be the same thing, so maybe we should just say it.
You want to do the classic on 11?
Yeah, okay, great.
Both: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11...
Let's work together again!
Let's work together again!
Yes! I knew it! That was awesome!
That was it, man. That was it.
Back in business.
(laughing): Yeah!
Let's start jamming ideas.
Turkey.
Robot. Turkey robot. Just got it in one.
All right, let's draw up a...
I don't think we did.
Okay. Ready? Black.
Robot. Black robot.
Ooh, that's even better, son.
Boom.
Let's push for number two.
Let's... let's...
Exactly...
Black robot.
The blackest robot in town.
That robot's so black, it's the blackest.
I feel like marketing's gonna be a nightmare on that one.
Okay. I'm not good at marketing. I'm good at ideas.
Let's stay away from robots.
Okay.
Yeah? All right.
Okay.
Robot robot.
I said let's stay away from robots, though, and you just said ro...
Okay.
Black turkey!
Look, let's maybe pick it up later.
Computers for babies.
We are back!
Hair that looks like a helmet. Or vice versa... helmet that looks like a hair is actually pretty smart.
Oh, I'm really hot right now.
A water bottle with the top cut off.
Schmidt: That's a cup!
That is just a cup. Scratch it.
Ladies. (gasping)
Ooh... you got bee'd up, dude.
Yeah.
You look like a monster.
Yeah.
I'm not even joking.
You look so ugly right now.
So ugly.
Look, I'm not some little sensitive British guy, okay?
I am Coach.
But right now, I am in so much pain that I am losing my mind.
And I might never recover.
So say hello to the new me, who's basically a street lunatic with a face made of f*re!
They sting you in your pants?
Yeah, they... they stung my doodad.
I'm gonna get you some lotion.
Ow.
Both: Ooh!
Jess: Everyone, um, before we begin this meeting, I just want to say that... yes, Ryan is my boyfriend.
And yes, I let it affect my job because I care what you think of me, and I always have.
But here's what you should know: I love my job, and I love this man right here.
Wow.
I've been waiting for a moment to tell you that, and I guess... this is it.
This is perfect.
And, uh, just for the record, I love you, too.
This speech is wonderful, so please keep going.
Oh, yeah. Um, and you can come to me with any problems or anything you want to ask me, but I'm gonna make some decisions that you don't like, and you're just gonna have to deal with it.
So, uh, let's get back to work, okay?
So, is that the end of the meeting, then?
Yep. Uh... yeah, I got a little carried away with the moment there. (laughs)
Anyway...
Put it on.
Put the crystal on.
And... There we go.
Not gonna do anything.
(Shania Twain - Any Man Of Mine)
(chuckles)
How do I look? What do you guys think?
Not bad, Winston. I'll tell you what, man... you look like the funny guy from Police Academy who does the... the voices, and different sounds.
(Imitates radio beeping and siren wailing)
God, I wish marketers had a uniform.
(construction clatter begins in distance)
To Winston Bishop, owner of cats, taker of baths, graduate of the LAPD.
(workman shouts, clatter and banging continue)
We are so...
I'm so proud of you!
What?
I'm so proud of you.
You're proud of me?
Oh!
When is this night construction gonna stop?
I actually don't mind it.
Gets me ready for all the loud action on the job, you know what I mean?
Something has gotta change.
(electric engine whirring)
(whirring stops)
(whirring resumes)
Well, don't worry, 'cause I have called the city's automated help desk and I've also sent out an e-mail to information(a)losangeles.gov, so action has been taken.
Jess, don't you know how democracy works?
We need to get out there and grease palms, blackmail people.
We need to send them an envelope filled with fake blood and... and a note that says...
"I know."
What?
(Winston clears throat)
As if... as if... we know what's really going on.
Schmidt, you do realize you're saying this in front of a police officer.
I'm so sorry.
A little respect.
Can I try on your uniform?
No, this uniform is for official police business.
(whoops) Yeah.
Looking good, man.
Yeah.
We got a code Jewish, code Jewish.
You under "ch'arrest."
I can't believe Winston's gonna be a cop.
I mean, he's the gentlest person I know.
He once broke his arm wrapping presents.
Remember when he made this?
He's the sweetest guy in the world, man.
He's just so nice and... vulnerable.
Yeah.
Although...
Don't know what this is for.
Winston: Hey. What're you guys doing?
Uh, n... nothing, man.
Look, I'm a little worried about you, okay?
And so is Coach.
(Chuckles)
Kind of worried about you, man.
Guys, calm down. I understand, I get it, and I'm... and I'm flattered that you're concerned about me, but I signed up for this, remember?
Also, my training officer is gonna be with me the entire time.
He's got a partner.
I forgot about the partner.
That's huge.
We're silly. Yeah.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be a real bad-ass, too.
Was in a biker g*ng for three years, undercover.
Can't go back to Arizona no more.
Is that True Detective?
Apparently eats b*ll*ts as a party trick.
Great, that's really good.
That makes sense, what are you, uh...
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
What's that?
What the... ?
Winston: Uh...
Which... Oh, that?
It's a, uh... it's a project.
I've had a report of people acting lame back here.
Schmidt: Ow, Jess!
Also, I tazed Schmidt.
Winston: All right, seriously... no more playing with the uniform.
Officer Leslie Biggins.
Okay, Biggins, so Bishop's gonna be next, okay? Come on.
All right, here we go.
Officer Hank Bishop.
Eh... Oh, that one.
Officer Win...
... field Bishop.
Ooh.
Well that's gonna cause a lot of mix-ups over at the station.
Officer Winston Bishop.
All: Oh! (Whooping)
(cheering, whistling)
Winston...
All: Winston, Winston, All (chanting): Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston... !
Coach: Yes.
Winnie!
(Horn blares)
Aah!
Sorry.
Wow, a lot of city officials around here.
Maybe somebody can help us with our noise problem.
Okay, enough of this by-the-book nonsense.
It's time to play hardball.
Be a shark, Jess. Not a dolphin.
Right.
So I shouldn't be the smartest and friendliest creature in the ocean?
That makes sense, bro.
Sharks eat whatever they want. Dolphins... they jump through hoops, so, yeah, I think it does make sense.
No, it's awesome, bro.
Okay, stop mockingly saying "bro."
My uncle was arrested for having sex with a dolphin.
What?
What?
Carry on.
I'm having a lot of difficulty nailing you down, Ryan.
Oh, there's councilwoman Fawn Moscato.
She's from our district.
Yummo.
Where do I place my ballot?
She better get ready, 'cause she's about to have a very friendly conversation with a concerned citizen... bro.
Okay, Jess, it's not gonna do anything.
Won't make a difference.
Like what I did there with the ballot thing?
It was a good joke, right?
Didn't get the reaction I thought it was gonna get from you guys.
No, we got it.
We got it, bro.
Oh, I get it.
And you know what, I've seen the Bollywood movies, I've seen the UK Office.
Not a fan, not a fan.
Congratulations. These are from all of us, but I'm the one that got 'em for you.
Wow, they're big.
So, Winnie, where's your bad-ass training officer?
Oh, guys, I would like for you to meet the person who will be training me as I brave the mean streets of L.A.: Officer Aly Nelson.
She's so small.
What... say...
Excuse me?
You're so small, you're...
What is happening?
I think what he was trying to say was that, um...
Yeah? we were expecting someone who looks a little more like a cop in the traditional sense.
That's what I meant.
No, no, no...
Wow. No, no, no.
I'm not trying to offend you, we were just expecting, like, uh, either a really strong man or kind of like a guy with, like, a mustache.
Got it. And flowers are a... that's a normal thing to give to a grown man?
Or are they trees?
I can't tell, I'm so small.
Cool friends, Bishop.
No, wait, Officer Nelson, just...
Thank you. Thank you very much, you guys.
Oh, also, thank you for the flowers.
And just we're clear... the first thank you was sarcastic, because you embarrassed me, but the second thank you was sincere as hell, because these flowers are glorious.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry about the construction noise... it's an issue close to my heart... I do charity work with deaf children.
Of course, they would welcome the noise, because it would mean they could hear.
Let me let you in on a little secret.
Just go to the public works web site and download this form.
You're a dear, Fawn.
(Laughs)
I made a pun and I didn't know it.
You're too much.
Oh.
Hi.
Schmidt, this is Fawn Moscato.
She was just giving me a shortcut to file some complaints about the noise.
(whispers): Looks like someone brought a shark to the dolphin show.
(squeaks)
That's a dolphin noise.
Ah. Very good.
Councilwoman Moscato, excuse my trembling, but it's an honor.
Your head is enormous.
Why, thank you.
Jess: So you're taking her out to dinner? That's your plan?
I'm intoxicating a single, overworked public official with the pleasure of my company.
Which I will then parlay into getting her to fix our problem.
Are my sleeves even? This is ridiculous.
You know, my new tailor sews like an army medic.
I'm not being overdramatic when I say that I would rather sit naked on a hot grill than wear something off the rack.
Schmidt, just don't screw this up.
She's a decent woman.
Oh, excuse me, at some point in the evening, can you let me know that I have a call from Karl Lagerfeld?
Schmidt.
Bob, how are you?
Tony, love you in a chino.
Guillermo, f*re up that grill, Fawn's hungry.
Guillermo: Sí, señora.
I'm Fawn Moscato.
And I approve this scotch.
Oh, goodness.
Okay, so I'm almost finished with form 7D42, but I'm not sure what to put down for landlord's birth city.
Hey. Ooh. What you doing, hot sh*t?
I was feeling saucy. I've had a glass of red wine.
Red wine makes you bonkers horny.
I'll make you a deal.
When I finish a form, you can take off an article of clothing, and that way, when I'm done, then we can just go nuts on each other.
Deal.
Hey, I'm not finished yet.
(sighs)
Oh!
This is America! Wear pants!
Jess: Red wine. Sorry!
Sorry. Sorry. Very sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Geez. Yeah.
Coach: So, tomorrow's your first shift, huh?
You gonna play the name game, do something fun and safe like that?
(Phone chimes)
Dude, I'm gonna be in a patrol car the entire time.
(laughing)
I just got a text from my buddy Reynolds.
Working his first shift, he got s*ab in the leg by a little girl.
(laughs)
I love Reynolds, man. He makes me laugh.
That's funny...
You think that's funny?
To be s*ab by a little kid, yeah.
Coach: On the job.
Right. 'Cause you get paid.
That you're about to do.
Right, 'cause it's a child, and it's hilarious.
You don't like getting cut.
You're very physically sensitive.
I am. Paper cuts give me headaches.
I can't wait to meet him.
Yeah.
Maybe he'll s*ab me.
Guys, chill out, okay?
I told you, I got my partner to protect me, remember?
The little one?
The one would could take a nap in a match box?
Which reminds me... I'm gonna make her a sandwich tomorrow.
I might even throw in a crossword puzzle with Winston-related clues so she can get to know me better.
"Who likes cats?" Winston, across.
I don't like this.
Mm-mm.
His training officer can't protect him!
She's too tiny.
She looks like she won the silver medal in Athens for the balance beam.
Girl could drown in a raindrop.
I mean, that's girl's...
I mean, she...
I can't think of one 'cause I'm so worried about Winston!
I'm worried about him, too, but I can still think of 'em.
Uh, girl's so, uh... Ugh!
She looks like a Persian Webster.
Ah...
Girl's like a pepperoni.
Why are you here?
We brought you a gift.
Assorted candies. Please enjoy.
They are delicious.
Now, I'm sure you have friends and family of officers coming in here all the time to check on them.
No. No, this would be a first.
Really? This is the first?
What do you guys need?
Well, we are here because, uh, Winston is our best friend, as you know, and, um...
(clears throat) ... we're worried about him.
Yeah.
And I'm not saying that you're bad at your job as a training officer.
But I'm not saying you're good at your job.
And that's why we're here... to kind of see where you're at, to see if you're ready to protect our asset, our dear friend.
Let's... let's be diplomatic.
Did Bishop put you up to this? Does he have some sort of problem with me being his training officer?
Not at all. No.
Oh, he is going to pay for this. He is going to pay.
He shouldn't pay for this.
This has nothing to do with it.
This is about us.
Okay.
First of all, you shouldn't get mad at him. Get mad at us.
Get out!
It's good to see you.
Get out.
Okay.
Yo. Ry-guy. (Laughs)
I finished printing out the forms.
Let's get goofy.
Mm.
Come on!
Aah. Mm-mm.
You got a real Dudley Moore thing going on right now, and I like it.
(Groans)
Jessica Day, I think I'm in love.
Sorry. Did you just say you were in love?
That woman is a dynamo.
So let's talk about the whole construction noise thing.
Has anyone ever told you you look like a Jewish Kennedy?
I hope not, because that would be offensive.
(laughs)
What? I thought you were supposed to be some kind of big shark, and you were playing her.
About the noise.
Given the many considerations... traffic, budgets...
Okay, what is happening?
What are you doing with your thumb?
We feel it best to proceed with the given strategy.
She played you!
I know, and it was wildly arousing!
But let me tell you something, Jess.
She played you, too.
No, she didn't.
Mm-hmm.
No, she didn't. I filled out the form, I submitted it. Here's the confirmation, right here. "Thank you for your inquiry. We will respond in 360-500 days... !"
Isn't she great?
She can't just walk all over the people of the city like the Jolly Green Giant.
Jolly Green Giant...
He doesn't stomp on people. He encourages them to eat their vegetables.
You can't let her do this! We have to keep fighting!
She's taking me to a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a carniceria tomorrow.
You know, Jess, I really think that she may be grooming me to be her arm candy.
This could be a real Bill and Hillary situation.
You, sir, are no Bill Clinton.
I know. I'm Hillary.
Well, you're not Hillary, either!
I am, too, Hillary!
Hey, man, can you be the one to walk away?
'Cause I just, like... My little sleeping British bulldog here is gonna wake up, and he's gonna get scared if I'm not there.
Yeah, I got you.
Yeah.
Jess: A bunch of neighbors have joined the fight.
See, if you put out an honest message, you get good, honest people to help you.
Per municipal code 2B, construction is prohibited at night.
However, this project's been issued a waiver that we are trying to revoke.
Now, I'm going to mash a muffin into the phone.
You tell me if it makes its way through.
Jess: You're doing a great job, Dave.
It's important to keep it positive.
So, what happened to Schmidt?
I don't need him. I got this on lockdown.
Yes, it is banana-walnut.
Now I'm gonna tell you the story of how my daddy spawned with a pony and made the mud boy... that's me.
"Chapter One... Mama's House."
Make sure they're sharp.
It's political su1c1de to not cut the ribbon on the first try.
Of course. Look, if there's anyone who understand the importance of a sharp Kn*fe, it's a Jewish man.
Hey, listen, about the construction issue...
We've discussed that.
Look, changing that schedule's a logistical nightmare, not to mention the people it'll piss off.
The sewage lobby's involved in that project, and trust me, you don't want to cross them.
Did they sh**t poopy everywhere?
How old are you? No. No, they just...
They contribute money to my opponent.
Of course. No, I... I knew that.
They... Why would they sh**t poopy everywhere?
No.
Yeah. Got it. Hey, listen, I wanted to warn you.
My roommates have recruited a g*ng of derelicts to... to protest the council meeting.
If only there was someone who could oppose them.
Of course, I can't, because it's technically a citizens' forum.
Are you saying that I should?
I'm not saying anything.
Oh. Okay.
You're trying to manipulate me again.
You must think that I'm a real shmendrick.
Well, hello there.
When we're in public, Yeah. ... Let's just tone down the Jewish thing, okay?
Let's tone down the Jewish thing.
Yeah.
I can do that. 100%. Let's tone down the Jewish...
Hey, by the way, sir, thank you so much for keeping the councilwoman safe.
Man: Five stars for Arman!
He's an Uber driver.
I'm a councilwoman, not a senator.
Okay, I felt like that...
(gags, coughs)
(coughing)
First day on the job. Is this where you tell me to forget everything I learned in training?
N... no!
Remember everything.
Bishop, if you have a problem with me being your training officer, put down your ice cream cone, take your frickin' thumbs out of your mouth, and say it to my face!
What?! I don't have a problem with you.
Did you or did you not tell your roommates to come check up on me?
What?! They did that?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness, I am so "furiated" right now.
I am very lucky to have you as my training officer.
My roommates don't speak for me.
I promise you will never have to see them again.
They're right there. They're literally right there.
Oh...
Oh, yeah, yeah, they see...
They got us. Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
(sighs)
When you step to the badge, the badge step back.
Don't ever say that in my car again.
What the hell are you two doing here? And why are you talking to Aly behind my back?
She said that you guys gave her weird unwrapped candy and then you stole toilet paper from the station bathroom.
We need that toilet paper.
Because we're worried about you!
We're trying to protect you.
What?
She's so small, Winston.
You guys should have faith in me.
I got a badge, I got a diploma, and I got a special plastic thing that goes over my hat for when it rains.
(over radio): We got a 339 in progress at 62 Sage Brush.
That sounds dangerous. Stop him!
Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing?
We can't let you do this!
We're trying to protect you!
What the hell is your problem?
This is scary! We're not letting you go on the street!
This an obstruction of justice. Dude, that is an obstruction...
You won't die on my watch!
Hey! Hey, Nick. Nick.
Oh! I can't give you these 'cause I care about you.
Nick, give me the keys.
Don't give 'em back!
We love you, man! We love you!
Winston: Coach, you know I can't jump that high!
Don't test me.
Coach: We're protecting you.
Give me those damn keys right...
Ooh, no, no, no, no... !
That's what you get! (Chuckles)
Ow! Ow!
I can't go to jail.
I'm too sarcastic for the white gangs.
Yeah, man, I'll get passed around in there like a bong.
Shut up.
Ow!
You're not going to prison.
The dangers of noise pollution are real.
According to the World Wide Web, it can cause lack of concentration, nervousness, and misunderstandings.
(banging)
Sir!
Sir... clearly, manual labor has sculpted your body perfectly, but could you please be quiet?
(New York accent): Sorry, lady, I gotta work all night.
But, sir, people live and work here.
Babies sleep, dogs nap by the window.
Immigrants share noodles and dance to records, with abandon.
You're right! We should be looking out for each other.
You said it, handsome guy.
But you know who else should be looking out for us?
The city.
(cheering and applause)
Would you stop clapping? This is an abomination.
By the way, he... the only reason he got that role is because he's sleeping with her.
You want to get a cheeseburger sandwich?
My nights just freed up.
Of course.
That sounds great now that I can hear you.
Mm. Nothing.
What? What are you doing?
The cuffs on your jacket just look a little short.
What?
They just look a little short.
Why are you telling me this now? I got a new tailor.
I'm really insecure about it.
My God.
I'm Jessica Day.
Thank you for listening.
(cheering and applause)
Man: Tone it down! Stop the noise!
(clearing throat loudly)
Ah. N... noise.
N... noise.
Where would... where would we be without you?
I don't know.
A tree falls, a cabin is made, uh...
(Schmidt muttering)
It just... this doesn't... doesn't look right.
A woman screams, a b... a baby is b... a baby is born.
Maybe if the speaker would stop fiddling with his jacket...
I just... It...
It just doesn't feel like these are...
He's saying all the right things.
That son-of-a-bitch tailor ruined my jacket.
(sighs) That... that baby that screamed becomes a man and that... that was the story of Abra... Abraham Lincoln.
How dare you evoke Lincoln!
He was our quietest president!
I feel... I'm just so...
I'm so uncomfortable right now, because of my sleeves.
I feel like an idiot up here, in this jacket! Nobody's telling me my... my...
The tailoring is off! I'm going...
I'm seeing... I'm seeing a new tailor, everyone.
Sir... ?
My tailor's great.
I'll give you his number: Eight.
I look like a freaking matador in this thing!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Sir, we've heard enough.
(Schmidt jabbering angrily)
Stand down! You look weak!
Considering the incoherent and, frankly, disturbing argument from the pro-noise lobby, I have no choice but to recommend a switch to the day schedule, effective immediately.
(cheering and applause)
New York!
What?
I'm Fawn Moscato, the people's warrior.
You're welcome, Los Angeles!
Tomorrow is a new America! Good night!
(cheering and applause)
Hello again.
I would like to once more revisit the bottomless clause of the public nudity ordinance.
Oh, my God, I almost hired that guy as a sub.
So, that was a huge failure. I feel like a Democrat.
Why'd you have to say that about my jacket?
All right. Okay, look, Jess told me to.
I mean, I thought your sleeves were fine. And by "fine,"
I mean I could not care less.
Oh, hello, shark.
I am woman, the smartest species of them all.
I didn't realize I'd finished that.
I've been waiting here a while.
You underhanded pig woman.
You know, there are certain things that you don't do, and exploiting a man's love of tailoring is one of them.
Which makes what you did all the more impressive.
Well, I felt dirty.
I felt like Evil Winston.
Remember when Winston was evil for that week?
I can't believe I blew it with Fawn.
You know, she said that we could have sex in the room where O.J. tried on the glove.
Schmidt, it doesn't matter what happened at the meeting.
She doesn't care about you. She's a power-hungry, self-obsessed woman who just wants a man to shut up and look pretty. That's not what you want, is it?
Please take me back.
Look, I was duped by a doe-eyed pixie and her Indian henchwoman. Forgive me.
It's fine. It actually worked out.
You were such a jackass up there that no one who supported the construction will be able to hold it against me.
Plus, I picked up a ton of votes.
Or as I like to call them... tiny orgasms.
So let me get this straight: You let me humiliate myself, in public, for your own political gain?
Hmm.
Yes.
You're the sexiest woman that I've ever met.
Ah...
Ms. Moscato, wherever you're going, take me with you.
Please... it's "Councilwoman."
And I'll call you when I need you.
That is gonna be... so frustrating.
But I love it.
Why are we in a church?
I once saw a priest drop his keys and bend over and pick it up, and it was just so human that it ruined religion for me.
It's a support group for families.
Pack it down. And you pack it down.
And now... weird friends.
... until one day, what happens?
And I know that his training officer is scary strong.
But, um, he's still my friend and the bad guys are still bad and I just wish I could put him in a giant envelope and just... just mail him away from all the bad guys... (crying)
There's no shame in this.
Do not judge this man.
We won't.
This is a support group.
I know what you're thinking: he looks like a little punk.
He looks like a little boy.
We... we try not to call names here.
Nick: Everybody look down. Don't look at him!
Good first day, Bishop.
Nick: You never look at a man when he cries.
Thanks.
Nick: Back me up, man.
You ever let your friends try on your uniform?
What? No.
Oh, yeah. Me either.
Don't do it. I'm serious.
Don't do that.
I won't. I won't.
Man: I'm telling you, you gotta keep clear!
What?
I'm... I'm not driving you to the ER this time!
It's your problem!
Get out of the way!
Don't look at me like that!
Man 2: All right, all right!
Morning, Jerry.
Hey, how are you doing?
How are you doing?
Eh. Different day, same bucket, right?
Is that today's Times?
Kristof's got a piece on net neutrality.
It's very complex, I don't know where I stand.
What kind of bagel do you want this morning?
Uh, poppy seed or sesame?
I'm going sesame today.
All right.
Get me a little schmear, would you?
Gingy, who did you harm?
Gingy, who ate your arm?
It was...
Santa!
No!
This is pretty dark.
We will rescue you, Gingy!
Wait till they get to the North Pole to avenge his death and take it way too far.
Santa's been a bad boy, and that's not right The white-bearded devil's gonna die tonight!
But I'm proud of that. They worked really hard on it.
Do you want to visit the prop closet?
Okay, just two more hours, and then it's ten days down a wine bottle.
Oh, my gosh.
All this sneaking around, I feel like gay guys in the '50s.
I can't believe you're going to London tonight.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Come with me.
What?
Spend Christmas with my family in London.
That's, like, skipping seven relationship steps.
What do you mean?
Do you really want your whole family to meet the weird American girl that you're making out with in a prop closet who's also your boss?
Yeah. - Everything's been going really, really well.
What if I use the wrong fork?
You won't use the wrong fork, 'cause I'll make sure that you-you don't.
No, it'll be very casual.
And I don't care what they think, 'cause I like you, and I want to spend Christmas with you in London.
I've never been to Europe. I...
We'll stroll through Hyde Park, empty townhouses owned by Russian billionaires.
We're gonna go to Big Ben.
I'll take on-on the wheel, the Eye.
We'll eat cheese on the wheel and-and make out.
Uh, we're gonna ride black taxicabs even to places where we don't need to go and we're not invited.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Okay, Alan.
You did your best.
Why did I agree to ride to the airport with everyone?
I'm an aspiring millionaire.
I should be taking a Town Car, not packed six-deep like a Hasidic family going to the bulk foods store.
Relax, Schmidt, we're all riding together so that we can hang out before we all go to our magical destinations.
Magical? I'm going back home to Long Island, the birthplace of the female crew cut.
Yeah, and I'm going all the way to New York because my mom wants to hand-deliver a Christmas card to Matt Lauer, but you, Jess, you're going...
To London!
'Ello, guvnor.
You got to stop it with that accent.
Fancy a tickle?
Borderline r*cist.
Check it out. I'm coming in hot with gifts for the family.
I'm ready for anything.
Is that a wallet necklace?
Yeah, so I don't get pickpocketed.
Smart. Keep that money away from them Gypsies.
Are you nervous about meeting his family?
No, no. Yes.
All right, here's the plan.
We're at O'Hare at 8:00, O'Leary's at 9:00, we're drunk by 6:00.
See what I did there? We're drinking on the plane.
Man, I love Christmas Eve Eve at O'Leary's.
I always get laid. See, here, I'm a six, sixish.
Uh, but I'm a Chicago ten.
Yeah. I'm a six, man? Maybe a little higher.
Seven.
But I'm... I'm a seven, thank you.
Plus Nick is dating Kai now, which means I'm getting the butt.
I'm getting all the butt.
I made you guys some snack bags.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
You're like my mom, but in ways I can appreciate.
Hey, Coach, what's taking you so long?
There he is.
I know what you're all thinking.
You think I'm selfish for going on vacation instead of going to Detroit to see my family.
Not thinking that; very defensive.
I live with a million people. Four people.
There are going to be a million people at my mother's house.
I need some me time. And yes, I will be sad to miss my baby niece and all of her Christmas joy, but I've made a decision that I'm happy with, and it hasn't been giving me stomach pains.
You seem really great.
Yeah.
I feel good.
Can we please go?!
Yeah!
Let's go to the airport!
Christmas!
I'm getting in.
No, no, no, no.
Too late.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Loving the new Ford Fusion!
You don't stink at all, man.
Nice.
Are you wet?
Just my bottom.
Check out how roomy this is.
You could open a hat store in here.
Why would I do that?
That tree's cool.
What's it doing?
It coaches you to drive more efficiently.
Oh, look at that. Your name is Coach. That's fun.
I don't know why that's fun to me, but it is.
Pretty funny, I...
Hey, Outside Dave, will you take a holiday picture?
Well, I'd prefer to paint you, but it appears time is pressed against us.
All right.
Let me get a good filter.
Okay, now pretend you're really thirsty, but the only thing that can quench your thirst is the tears from a golden retriever. Go.
Oh, that's good.
Aaaaaand.... got it.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
Excuse me, what's going on?
Midwest storm. Everything's delayed.
God have mercy on us all.
Ow! Ow!
Move, white bitch!
Ryan, hi.
My flight's delayed.
Please tell your parents this is not like me.
I am never late.
On time or naked is what I always say.
I've never said that.
I'll be fully clothed, but late.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay, I got this. Coach, your flight's okay.
Thanks, Jess. I'm going to go find a charging station so I can, uh, call my niece before Hawaii.
Everyone stop looking at me!
Cece and Schmidt, you're on the red-eye.
The red-eye? What do I look like, a 24-year-old who's too afraid to break up with his college girlfriend?
I mean, thank you for this.
Nick and Winston, I got you guys.
Next.
Hi. Hi.
First and foremost, I'd like to wish you a very merry Christmas.
Next.
Uh, right.
Um, my friends are trying to get on the Chicago flight.
Uh, Winston Bishop and Nick Miller.
Yeah, standby, tenth and 11th on the list.
I really appreciate that, but... is there any way you could get...
Nope. And now they're 12th and 13th.
I'm sorry. I was...
Don't apologize. 14, 15.
I didn't apologize.
16, 17.
Sir.
You seem like a reasonable person.
I'm not and you're at 18 and 19.
Okay... You know what?
You want mean, I'll give you mean.
I hope your mom falls down the stairs and she hurts parts of herself.
I hate my mom. Back to 16 and 17.
Thank you.
Don't thank me. 18, 19.
It's Christmas.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I thought they just did a black version of Annie for no reason.
20, 21.
You...
22, 23.
But...
24, 25.
Sir.
They're on the wing, dear.
Next?
No.
Next?
Stop pushing.
Flight 202 to Dallas - Fort Worth cancelled.
Hey, let's wait in the first-class lounge, like the other HBO GO subscribers.
You're a member?
Cece, I grew up on the mean streets of Long Island, just gazing up at the Manhattan city skyline, thinking, "You know what, one day, I'm gonna get there."
That first-class lounge is my Manhattan.
"Greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude."
Oprah Winfrey.
Sir, may I help you? Are you a member?
I just had an incredible layover.
Flew in from Istanbul. I just need to lay down for a while.
I'm a little...
Okay? Certainly. Uh, do you have a first-class ticket or a membership card?
Do I have a... a membership card?
Let me ask you something. I tend to, uh... tend to deal with, uh, Sarah Beth.
I'm not aware of a Sarah Beth, sir.
The last time I talked to her, she was suffering from the diabetes.
Is she still on the inhaler?
Uh...
Did she pass?
She passed, didn't she?
I'm afraid I...
I'm gonna need a minute.
I'm just gonna go inside, sit down, just kind of take...
Are you a member, sir?
Am I a mem...?
Can we just get two guest passes, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
That's a real thing... guest passes?
Yes, sir.
Okay. It's a debit card.
Is Ro-Ro done yet? Damn.
Okay, uh, have her call me, but m-my phone's about to d...
My ph... Hello?
Damn it.
Really? Phone and a laptop?
You're playing solitaire?
Is that a keyboard?
Dude, come on!
Why we should've taken trains.
The sky's too fickle.
It's the play place for butterflies.
"Can't wait to see you.
House at the end of the lane"?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What?
This is where Ryan lives.
Whoa!
What?
It's a gorgeous mansion.
He said it was casual.
Does "casual" mean something very different in England?
Like... like "we own England"?
That's some McDuck money!
That's "do whatever I want" money.
Exactly. - You better learn how to ride a polo horse.
It's actually a polio horse.
Uh, originally they were bred as helper horses for people with polio, but I don't think anything of what I just said was correct, so...
What is...? Are you all right?
Hey. My flight's delayed.
Might not even meet his very rich family.
Anyway, you guys should go to your-your gate.
Get out of here, you Christmas... packages.
All right. Merry Christmas.
All right, let's... Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
All of that good stuff.
See you later.
Safe travels.
Is that a falcon wearing a necklace?
Can I help you?
Sir...
I'd like the strongest drink you have, and also a wine spritzer on the side in case I don't like it.
Thank you.
Looks like somebody's not so merry.
Come on.
Are you...?
Okay, um... that's silly.
I really want this to be true.
What seems to be troubling you?
I just found out that my boyfriend is... is really rich, and there's no way his parents are gonna like me, and he's... Well, have you ever thought that the world is just full of sloths, and then one day, this beautiful lion walks in?
Actually, you've probably never thought that way, Santa.
Can I just go ahead and call you Santa?
Anyway, should I just bail on this trip?
Hmm, sounds complicated.
Yeah. Why don't you come with me to the family bathroom, sit on my lap, and I'll give you the sleigh ride you'll never forget?
What? Santa!
North Pole.
Player for life.
Get out of here!
Pervert Santa! No cookies for you here, you white-bearded freak!
Well, well, well.
If it isn't ol' Bangs LaRue.
Don't test me, sweetie. I'll put your head in a trash can.
Wow.
You and I are gonna drink.
Wow, this place is just so amazing.
You got to feel this pillow.
Look at this thing. This is the pillow that all the other pillows want to have sex with.
Nice. Look at that guy.
Bet he's the kind of guy who takes one bite of lobster and just throws the rest of it in the trash.
I'd love to do that... just once.
Stupid trash lobster.
He's coming over.
Hello, sir.
First time in the lounge?
Uh...
What's that, now?
Come on. Why would you say that?
Because of all the pillow squeezing.
I get it.
I get it. I was like you once.
Where are you from?
I'm from New York.
Uh, Manhattan, of course.
Mainly the money and museum district.
I can see the Central Park horses defecating from my window.
That's funny. So can I.
Robert Goodwin.
All right.
Schmidt.
Mind if I sit?
Please, go ahead.
Due to increased security, please have your picture ID ready.
All right, here's what we got to do.
We got to convince a bunch of people not to fly, and then we're at the top of the list.
It's foolproof... unless it doesn't work.
Then it didn't work, so I think we got a 50-50 chance to do it, so let's do it.
Wait.
Ah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.
What's up, boys?
Those are the guys I was just drinking with at the bar.
Are you sure you guys can fly a plane?
I'm sure it's not a big deal.
I bet the weed will offset the booze.
Ah, hey there, precious.
Yeah, you're quiet now, but when that air pressure hits you, you're gonna be screaming like a cat in the dishwasher.
And I won't stop you.
This could be it, so... if we all die on this plane, was it worth it?
I say yeah, let's get to Chicago.
Who cares? It's snowing there.
You gonna bite me?
When we get on the plane, I'm gonna bite you back.
Breast-feeding is a... very sensitive subject for me.
I can help who's next. Sir?
Uh, sir, he doesn't work here.
Oh, yes, I do.
Uh, no, you... - Oh, I'm sorry. Your flight's been canceled.
The flight has not been canceled.
Flight's been canceled.
Security!
Security! Please get this woman out of here!
Please get this man...
She's wearing a fake outfit.
You know what? I don't know...
Debbie, don't start with me. You're in a mood.
And then he sent me this text.
Oh, my God.
Where's Anna and Mr. Bates?
Do you watch Downton?
Yeah.
I know it's a soap opera, but I like it.
It's not even about the money.
That's big.
It's like every new piece of information I get about him just makes him more and more out of my league.
Mm.
He'll be nice about it, but the moment I get there, everybody will know I don't belong there.
Am I being dumb?
No.
Did I ever tell you about that time I met my ex-boyfriend's family over the holidays?
I've known you for 20 minutes.
Well, it was worse than the last season of Scrubs.
A teaching hospital? Come on!
People think Christmas is gonna be like Love Actually and "God Only Knows" is gonna play over their happy ending, but it won't.
Do what I do.
Hide out with a pizza and save the big issues for the New Year.
Oh, God.
Don't judge me for eating pizza!
No. My presents are gone.
What?
Santa stole my presents.
He was a Reverse Santa.
"Reverse Santa"?
What am I gonna do now?
You can't go now.
You're right.
I can't.
God, I'm drunk at work.
Sis?
Hello.
Hey. Let me talk to Ro-Ro.
Hmm-mm. I'm not trying to make you feel better about lying naked on the beach sipping some nonsense instead of seeing your family.
And are you using the cuteness of your daughter to blackmail me to come to Christmas?
Am I? Yeah, I am, actually.
Ro-Ro, it's your Uncle Ernie!
If you can hear me, get your mom's hair wet, then get on the phone while she's freaking out!
You want to speak to your niece, you know where she is.
Diversification.
That's what it's all about.
You know, I keep telling Nick that, but he won't listen to me.
Hey, man to man.
Anything. What?
I'd love to take a run at your girl.
Excuse me?
Now, don't tell me you're exclusive.
Successful men like us, we don't order just one item off the menu.
I'll tell you what.
You do this for me, and I'll do this for you.
Gold Select.
Gets you into any airport club in the world... minus New Zealand.
What's going on guys?
Closing some deals?
Well, actually...
No... we are not.
You know what they call you where I'm from?
A dirty old bitch.
Dirty old "biatch."
"Biatch," just in general.
'Cause I ain't from Manhattan, sir.
I'm from Long Island.
5-1-6, up in your lounge, sucka.
You better calm down, or you're gonna be kicked out of the...
Good, I don't want to be in this lounge, I don't want to be in any club that you're a part of.
Okay, am I missing something?
I don't want to be in any lounge or club that you're a part of, sir.
You dirty old bitch, for good measure.
'Cause I'm from Long Island, I'll take the railroad... LIRR.
You're embarrassing yourself.
New York, Long Island.
Billy Joel.
Cece, let's roll.
Okay.
Nassau County.
Billy Joel, one more time.
"Piano Man."
"Goodnight Saigon."
That's a sad one.
Cry about that, you dirty old bitch.
So they go to this bar in Chicago to get Winston laid...
And one of these guys is your ex?
Yeah, Nick.
Mm, the nicest thing I ever did for an ex is give him a ride to the airport.
And for me, that's just going to work, and I still barely did it.
Okay, please don't take this as a Christmas miracle.
But what can I do to help?
Do you want to fly first-class somewhere, like Pittsburgh?
And then tell everyone you're a Latin pop star?
I did that once, and it's kind of the perfect Christmas.
You can pass as Latin.
Actually, you know what I'd love?
Hope first class is okay.
And don't freak out, but I think Paul Dano's on your flight.
And don't thank me, thank her.
But thank me also, because I'm the one that did it.
Wow, this is really amazing.
Thank you, guys.
Don't thank us, go.
Call me if you want to hang out this week.
I was thinking about going to the mountains and crying at some point, but that's flexible.
All right, I got to bounce before these people I bumped come after me.
Don't worry, they deserve it.
I'm being bumped?
You're an idiot, I'm Gold Select.
Check it out.
Come on, just tell me what he said.
Without going into specifics, he disrespected something more important to me than any stupid lounge.
Daniel Craig's tailoring?
No.
Something priceless.
Hey.
What?
I stole you something.
Bam!
You sneaky Indian mouse.
I'm in my own lounge now.
Look, I know this is kind of dumb to say, but I really like being your friend.
My friend.
I like being your friend, too.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Schmidt.
Merry Christmas, Cecilia.
Is it crazy that I'm considering going to Detroit instead of Hawaii?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I thought that.
Ooh, this is a fancy seat.
Reminds me of the seat my grandmother used to ride up and down the stairs in.
Hey, Jess.
Damn thing was comfortable.
Thank you, first class is amazing.
Smells like rich people.
I'm so glad.
These are nice.
Hey, where are you? Did you board?
Um, yeah, I'm on the plane, I'm sitting in my seat.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
Wait, w... Jess, what was that?
Uh, they're telling me to turn off my phone.
Uh, we're taking off now.
Jess, hold on, hold on, hold on, J...
How do you change this...?
How do you change this thing?!
To the hits?
I don't know, like top 40?
Jess, what's going on?
I'm not going.
Are you kidding me?
You saw the house.
It's too much pressure.
Je...
And Santa stole my gifts.
Wait, Santa did what?
What if I do something wrong and... and I lose Ryan?
So, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna spend Christmas alone?
Sir? We're about to take off.
Yeah.
We need you to turn off your phone.
I understand.
I just need one minute.
It's gonna be fine, don't worry.
I mean, it's cra...
Sir?
Now, sir.
I'm trying to figure something out.
If she's not getting on a plane.
Hey, Nick!
This is first class!
Act like you've been somewhere before!
Merry Christmas, Nick.
Jess, hey!
Sir.
Jess.
You're not spending Christmas alone.
Oh, no.
You're going to England.
What are you guys doing?
Hey, you think you're gonna lose Ryan 'cause you're not good enough for his stupid family?
Has he ever had five people get off planes for him?
I-I hadn't gotten on mine, yet.
T-To be fair, we were in the food court, but it's beautiful, keep going, Nick.
Look, Jess, we're not getting on our flights unless you get on yours.
Airport chicken, that's right.
You want to take down everyone's Christmases?
Don't be that person.
You got to go to England, and you have to just try.
Go to England, Jess, it's worth it.
But my flight's boarding, and I don't have any gifts, and there's no way I'm gonna make it.
Oh, no, you are gonna make it, come on.
Yeah.
All right, let's go!
This doesn't seem great.
Okay, you know what, let's go, let's go.
Let's just, let's just run.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
So, I guess this is good-bye.
I don't care if there's no time.
I love you guys.
Ah, come on.
Get out of here!
Love doesn't matter!
Merry Christmas.
Bye.
Give me a little space.
Ugh!
Light a match.
Cece, watch.
Oh, my God.
Got him.
Hi, Ro-Ro.
Uncle Ernie!
Hey, I'm here. Are you here?
I'm here.
I got your text, and I came here to surprise you.
I'm outside your loft. Where are you?
Oh, no! No!
I'm in London.
Stay where you are, I'll be there in 17 hours.
Hey, hey, hey. Here, scoot down, scoot down.
Nick, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Sorry, just scoot down, I need to iron this shirt that I'm wearing for my date with Tran's granddaughter.
It's either this or the turtleneck my mother bought me in 2009.
They're my only clean shirts.
The short-sleeved turtleneck? Don't do that.
Okay, look, we need this whole table for Nadia's baby shower, all right? So, move along.
Nadia, isn't that the Russian chick who broke, uh, Schmidt's, uh...
Schmidt: Will to live?
After she broke my penis?
(chuckles)
Who saw her and thought, "That's the woman I want to be the mother of my children"?
She's not sure.
Yeah, she calls it her little "sex party miracle."
Do you have to iron here?
It's the only flat surface!
Besides Winston's desk... but he's using it to study for his police academy test, and he is "not to be disturbed."

There's an ironing board in the bathroom.
I know, but I've been using that to wedge it between two urinals to keep Schmidt from peeking.
But fine, I'll use that!
Schmidt: Coach! Coach!
My Charlie Rose episodes, all 18 of them, are gone.
DVR is chockablock filled with American football matches, which, by the way, is a garbage... Oh!
We cool?
(Exhales)
Yeah, we cool.
Cool.
What the hell just happened?
Fight.
Yeah. Now it's over.
I barely even remember it.
I cannot believe you guys handle things that way.
I'm starting to think that neither one of you read the Madeleine Albright biography I gave you for Christmas.
(chuckles) I'm so glad we don't fight.
I know.
Coach: Oh, please. Women fight.
Well, we occasionally get into a little thing.
Yeah, I mean, like we just had that thing with the purse... but that was, like, barely even a thing.
Yeah, that was nothing... I mean, there's no point in even talking about it.
Oh.
(Gasps) Oh.
Oh. No, you should have that.
No, you should have it.
No, you take it.
No, you take it.
No, you take it.
I want you to take it.
No. Take it.
Look, I want you to have it
'cause it would look good on you.
- No, it's made for you. You...
No.
But then we both decided that it was better if neither one of us bought it.
Yep.
The neon yellow purse?
With the strap?
Yeah, I've seen that.
It's in your closet.
I wonder how many rubber duckies needed to die to make that thing.
Uh, Schmidt, you don't know what you're talking about.
I got to run.
Oh...
What?
Thank you so much for helping with the baby shower.
You know, you are just the best.
No, you're the best.
Whoa.
Did I tell you I love your top, by the way?
No. Oh, I just found this in the back of my closet.
What's... what's happening?
(whispers): You said too much.
So, I'll call you later?
Definitely.
Okay. Bye!
Bye!
(door closes)
Oh, my God!
What just happened?
That's a girl fight.
Schmidt, stay out of it, man.
Girl fights are dangerous, okay?
I grew up with three sisters, and I wore a cup until I was 14 years old.
What's wrong?
They planned to wear braids and bows and didn't tell me on purpose.
There. Now you match.
Well, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women. You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.
Schmidt...
Let us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.
I grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.
You can't buy that kind of access.
Schmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.
You don't want to get in the middle of that.
Coach...
Jess has the purse. I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.
Coach: No, no, no...
See?
Look... the purse.
In the immortal words of Tag Team, "Whoop. There it is."
Fine. I went back and I bought the purse, 'cause I love it.
(frustrated groan) I love purses.
And that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist, either.
I'm a damn feminist who loves purses.
Where else am I supposed to keep my feminist writings?
In a purse, that's where.
Lena Dunham.
I don't know. I...
Jess, it's a purse. Who cares? Just apologize.
Cece and I have been friends for 20 years.
Do you know why? Because we're passive-aggressive people.
We never confront anything.
That's the way it works with us. It always has.
Hi.
Hi.
And that was one of the worst fights we've ever had.
And if I bring up the purse, then everything else comes up with it.
Too many things have happened.
Women have amazing memories.
Because we used to be the gatherers, and so we had to remember where all the best berries were hidden.
And Cece and I, we've hidden berries all across the Great Plains.
Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska... need I say more?
Coach gets it.
See, Cece and I, we're gonna be fine, 'cause it's gonna play out the way it always does.
We're not gonna talk for three days, and then I'll surprise her with a latte. And then we'll act like nothing happened.
Three days without Cece?
Do I have to spend three days without Cece?
Yes. I don't trust you around her.
She makes you weak and penis-dumb.
Three days without Cece? Why don't you just replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic?
Stay out of it, man.
Stay the hell out of it, bro.
Here's a different take: Why don't I spend more time with her?
Stay out of it.
I'm confused.
Now, should I... are you asking me to spend more time with her or stay out of it?
Like, for real?
(groans)
I hate this. I hate first dates.
Me, too. I hate all...
I hate the second ones and the third ones and the fourth ones.
Me, too. Yeah. Yeah.
I hate dates.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
The first ones are the worst.
Yeah.
This is terrible.
They're terrible. They're awkward.
I feel like I'm being weird.
You're not being weird.
Yeah, I am.
I'm the weirdo.
I wanted to do this all night.
Oh.
That is so stupid. (Laughs)
I hated that I did it.
I feel like I'm being weird, too.
How?
I don't know how. Just...
Well, now you are.
These sweaters. I got sweater shoulder.
Now... when you do that, it's very weird.
But before, it wasn't.
Just don't do sweater shoulder.
Please don't tell Tran how bad this is going.
Oh, I will.
Don't. It'll be so embarrassing.
Yeah.
He's probably my best friend.
Really?
Yes.
You're not his best friend.
(laughing)
That's a terrible thing to say. (Laughing)
It's true.
This is going great.
Oh, God, I hate this.
I just want to sit around and do nothing, but that is not hot.
That's hot to me.
You add some sweatpants to that, and that is better than p*rn.
(chuckles) I love p*rn.
But I like to mute it and come up with my own voices, like, (deeply): "Hey, that's a very interesting mesh cat suit."
(high-pitched): "Thank you. It used to be my grandmother's."
(laughs) Something like that.
Cheers.
Yeah.
That was a weird cheers!
Can we go?!
(laughs): Yes. Let's get out of here. This sucks!
(chewing, speaking unintelligibly)
So cute.
Yeah, it's like they're made for each other.
They haven't moved in three days.
Very weird.
Alarming, even.
Wait, doesn't she work or... ?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Or live somewhere?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Or have worried loved ones?
Studying?
Coach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.
But I'm on to her.
I didn't know girls could be so slovenly.
I did. I have sisters.
Oh, my God, we know.
(grunts)
We cool?
We cool.
Oh. Just who I was looking for.
Hey.
How would you like a piping hot latte?
Thanks, Jess, but, you know, I, um...
I can buy my own.
What did you do?
Is this about the socks?
You weren't supposed to talk to Cece. What happened?
Well, I had to see her.
I can't go three days without seeing Cece.
(exhales) And it went just like you said it would.
I'm gonna go get the purse.
She played me like John Popper plays that little harmonica and fiddle thing.
Ugh. She's like a robot scientist.
And you're like a damn robot.
And usually it's cute, except when you're robbing me.
Jess, I'm sorry. So... what... what happens now?
You bring her another coffee and you guys make up?
I don't know what happens now.
We're in unchartered territory 'cause you got involved.
We're entering the abyss.
It's like the month I decided not to wear a bra. Those were dark times.
I had no support. Literally no support.
(Phone dings)
(scoffs) Cece just texted me a smiley face.
Is that bad?
No, she just texted me the world's first good smiley face.
I'm gonna text her... (chuckles) ... a yellow heart.
No, uh, yellow heart, whale, thumbs up.
(Whoosh)
Well, that seems nice.
(Whoosh)
(gasps)How dare she? Chinese man, ballerina, apartment building?
What does that mean?
Fine. Poop. Turban guy. Granny.
(whoosh, whoosh)
Don't text her poop.
(Gasps) expl*si*n, monkey-see? You want to play dirty? Fine.
Slice of cake. Turtle.
(Whoosh)
Don't sen... Oh.
(Whoosh) (gasps)
Double syringe?
Double syringe.
You're right, Schmidt.
Maybe it's time to dig up some berries.
The gatherers have become the hunters.
Be well.
Wh... where are you... where are going?
L... leave those berries be.
- Republican or Democrat?
West Wing.
What's your favorite thing about America?
- Kentucky women.
Favorite part of The Rock?
"Welcome to the Rock."
Gorilla or monkey?
Gorilla, hands down.
Miranda or Carrie?
Gorilla.
That's 100% perfect.
Unb... unbelievable.
Thank you.
The battery in the remote control is getting a little jumpy. I'm gonna go grab one out of the smoke detector.
That's exactly where I get them.
Isn't she perfect?
In a word: No.
Nick, you might want to sit down for this.
I'm already sitting.
Okay.
Well, look... I put together a profile.
Vague about where she lives.
Okay.
No mention of a job.
Always lets you pay.
Nick, my man, as unbelievable as this sounds... (chuckles) ... you're her sugar daddy.
What kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy?
Only one kind: a homeless woman.
Kai is not homeless.
Nick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?
She... she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.
She always dresses in layers, tons of layers.
She's not homeless. Her grandfather is Tran.
And where does he hang out?
A park bench.
I think you're having a nervous breakdown.
I really do.
You're nuts. You want to avoid studying so much that you're making up lies about my new lover friend.
Just leave us alone.
Maybe you should... maybe you should give her our can opener. Everybody gives bums cans, but they can't open them cans.
How are they gonna open the cans, Nick?
Hey...
What are you... (stammers)
Do you want a blanket?
I must have fallen asleep reading.
Nap with me.
Okay.
Come on.
(Short chuckle)
Just... gonna get some of these newspapers.
It's actually kind of nice.
See?
(indistinct conversations)
More pink lemonade?
I'm going to name baby...
Baby, because it's funny. (Giggles)
(soft chuckle)
Where is top of baby cage?
Double syringe?
Hey, you. How's pee-pee? (Giggles)
Oh, hello, Nadia.
Coach, I need you. Jess and Cece are in a thing, and it is terrifying.
I'm pretty busy, but, all right, hold on, let me put down the stuff I've been working on.
(softly grunting)
Coach, I am at the baby shower.
You're at the... what?
Are you dumb? You're dumb.
You're very dumb. Get out of there.
I panicked. I didn't know what else to do.
I thought I could fix this. I gave Cece the purse.
Obviously, it was a mistake.
Oh, God, look at them.
They're like silent, angry statues right now... it's terrifying and als...
Maybe a little erotic.
Okay, fine, it's very erotic.
You know what? Coach, I'm telling you...
I'm finding out that fear plays a big part in my sexuality.
Schmidt, what happens when two passive-aggressive people start confronting each other?
I don't know. What happens?
Anything!
Anything can happen. That's what I'm telling you.
Are you ready for anything to happen?
Obviously not. That's why I'm calling you.
Did you wash your hair? It looks really clean.
(all quietly gasp)
(Jess gasps)
I can help you end this.
Do you know why?
Do you know why? I'm waiting.
Oh, my God, is it because you have sisters?
It's because
I have sisters! And you know what that means?
And that you know more about women than me.
I know more about women than you.
And that I'm a little dum-dum.
And I'm a big smart-smart.
Yeah. Now, here's what you're gonna do.
Get big like a bear.
If that doesn't work, pee a circle around yourself and light it on f*re.
I peed before I came... I had a root beer with lunch.
I'm on my way. Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?
'Cause I don't want to be that guy.
You know, the guy that doesn't bring a gift?
Just get over here.
All right, I'm coming.
What? Coach.
Coach, I can't turn the pages.
How am I gonna study if I can't turn the pages?
Coach!
Hey.
(gagging)
Great catch.
Kai, I want to go to your place, okay?
Wherever it is.
So don't be afraid, because I'm not afraid.
I know I'm living this rock star life, but I'm still a man of the people.
But I'm so comfortable. You really want to go outside, get off this bed into the cold right now?
Look, I like you for you, and...
Well, hell, I just hope, deep down, you like me for me and not all the incredible stuff that I have.
Huh?
I mean, this room... half this stuff is mine.
I'm, like, I have enough pillowcases for all my pillows, plus an extra pillowcase that I don't even use.
Ticket stubs to all the Bears games I've ever been to, except for one.
The guitar pic from that guy who played with James Taylor that one night.
A Frisbee that I'm currently storing on my neighbor's roof.
You know, an autographed
Karate Kid II poster from Mr. Miyagi.
R.I.P.
Hmm.
But none of that matters.
I want to be with you wherever you live.
I mean, hell, I've been cooped up in this palace for long enough.
Wow. Well, if it's that important.
(grunts)
(laughs)
All right. Don't be nervous.
You know what? I'm gonna bring some extra blankets.
Okay.
Okay, just in case it's freezing, 'cause it's outs...
Okay.
Jess: And then, you told Mike Hannamin I was on my period!
He wanted to know why you were wearing sweatpants in the pool!
Okay, I was defending you!
I have arrived!
Ah, Mr. Stripper.
Okay, so what's next, Jess?
20 years of fights are happening right now.
They're getting into everything.
How I intentionally didn't put gas in your car on senior ditch day?
You did. You did.
I did not!
All right, ladies, stop it.
I gave you the money, and you spent it on condoms and taffy.
By the way, that sounds like a hell of a day.
Well, I wouldn't know. I was stranded on a beach being a virgin!
But that's not the only time I've been stranded, now, is it?
I'm talking about Paris.
Oh, this is about Paris!
I'm talking about Paris.
I knew it!
We had signed a lease. That's an agreement.
And then you decide to take a modeling job in Paris, so I had to move in with Spencer?
While you were being squired about the Louvre, I was having to pee on top of Spencer's pee to conserve water!
You know, it's called mud-sharking, by the way.
It's not my fault!
Stop it!
I'm bored.
Here's what you guys are gonna do.
You're gonna punch each other.
Now I'm not bored.
I'm not doing that.
What?
I'm not doing that.
Coach: Well, you got to do something.
Man up, punch each other and end this.
(sighs, sniffles)
Coach: You gotta have it out so you can get past this.
Now I'm bored again.
Punch each other!
Now I'm not bored.
Talk with your fist!
(sighs) I just want my...
(screaming, overlapping shouting and chatter)
Oh, no!
My goodness!
Back off!
(grunting)
La... ladies?
Oh!
Schmidt: It's spreading.
Stop it!
Russian baby shower.
(overlapping chatter, groaning)
(groaning, indistinct chatter)
Hey, hey, don't involve us, please.
Whoa. Hey, guys, no!
Break it up! Break it up!
(Grunting)
Baby shower! Baby shower, yeah! Baby shower!
Oh, stop it!
You stole my babysitter!
What are you doing?
I'm having a situation.
Oh, come on, dude.
Get off!
Fighting for no damn reason with me?!
Come on, just... lie down and take it like a woman!
This is for Mike Hannamin.
(Groans)
(laughing)
(screaming)
Baby kick. Baby like.
Yay!
Do I look pretty?
(both laughing)
Do you feel, like, really good right now?
Yes! I thought I was crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
I think I... I think I wanted to punch you for a really long time.
Felt that way. Like maybe ten or 15 years.
And it feels so good that right now we don't have to talk everything through.
Yeah. We can just punch it out.
Oh, my God, I have missed you.
(both laughing)
I can't believe I've known you 20 years.
And you're still my favorite person to talk to.
And you're my favorite person to talk to.
I hate not talking to you.
I feel like I've missed everything!
You did miss everything.
So, does Nick have a girlfriend?
Yes. So weird.
You okay?
Yes. So weird.
(Laughing)
So, is Nadia going to raise the baby in your apartment?
Yeah, we haven't really talked about that yet.
You should.
(laughing)
Craig Hodges.
Oh!
(Phone ringing)
Hello. Nick. Nick, are you okay?
Nick: Winston?
Listen, listen, listen, Nick.
Winston.
Tell me everything.
Winston, she's rich!
Yeah, she founded some company that sells fancy water bottles to rich people to pay for digging wells in Africa.
She sold the company, so now she works whenever she wants.
It's a scam called consulting.
You see, I knew it.
I knew there was something weird. I was right!
You were wrong about literally everything.
But I knew there was gonna be a twist, though.
Okay, do you realize how much time you've wasted, and you're not studying?
Sweet Baby LeBron James, I screwed up.
(groans)
Hey, I should probably get going.
I got to get to work.
Yeah, it's karaoke night, so I got to get there early enough to break the karaoke machine.
How much will you make tonight?
Ah, it depends how much I drink, but probably about 140 bucks.
What is this?
I raise you to $200.
Now you can stay.
Deal.
Oh. (Laughs)
I'm like a boy hooker.
(both laugh)
Thank you.
Are you crying?
Don't look at me.
I want to look pretty. You paid for it.
(both laugh)
Nadia is the one who broke my thing.
Wait, you were serious about that?
Yes. That was her. I'm telling you.
She's going to have to childproof the corners of her cha-cha before that baby comes out.
Oh, Cecilia.
Thank goodness. Look at you. You're still pretty.
And, Jess, you know, you... you look the same.
Coach: I'm sorry about making you guys punch each other.
Don't be sorry.
You're so right.
Mm.
We've wasted so much time being passive-aggressive.
We learned our lesson.
Yeah.
Well, we're very smart.
That means a lot. Thank you.
Seriously, if you guys fought like girls, you'd still be arguing over the fact
that you recorded football over your Charlie Rose episodes.
It's all good, man. Yeah, well, it's nothing.
Mm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt would be like, "Oh, does Coach just think I'm a pretentious poseur who just records things to look smart because deep down, I am just terrifyingly insecure about my intelligence?"
Jess: Yeah, and girl Coach would be, like, "Does Schmidt think that I'm an uncultured meathead who has to rewatch football because I'm afraid of showing anyone my softer side?"
(clears throat quietly)
(Cece and Jess laugh)
Hey, man.
Oh, hey, Coach.
Aw, hey, you.
That's nice.
Oh, this?
I... I don't know. Thanks, I guess.
I'm kind of whatever about it.
No.
What do you got there?
Oh, me? Uh, just some sneakers.
(laughs) I hope they're okay.
I don't have an eye for things like you.
Well, yeah, you do. Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
Your eye is so good.
I'm sure they're great.
I...
Not that you could look bad in anything really.
(laughs)
(groans)
(groans) Son of a...
(groans) Thank you for that.
Yeah, thanks, man.
Anytime.
We cool?
Yeah, we cool.
(whistles)
Ooh, boy.
How many pages are in this thing?
Darius Miles. Oh!
That's in there?
Jordan!
Massaging is illegal?
What?
Gotta download a song.
Friends, ex-girlfriend, Winston, months ago I warned you that winter was coming.
And for the cold and wretched days ahead, I stressed our need to take lovers and take them quickly.
Jess: Your head is huge.
(chuckles) Your hat's the size of a garbage can.
Nick: You look great in that hat, man. What a hunk.
Jess: You look like Jewish Pharrell.
Th-Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Okay, now, winter is now here.
And I vow that we will not miss our final opportunity for sexual realization in 2014.
Did you steal my belt buckle, you Silly Billy?
Enough out of you, Winston!
Silly Billy? Dude.
If you unzipped your face and an old white woman popped out, I would not be shocked.
Really?
No.
I would.
I would be very surprised.
That is why this year we will not be celebrating Thanksgiving.
Instead, we will be celebrating...
Remember last Thanksgiving when I almost d*ed?
(others agreeing, chattering)
Bangsgiving! We'll be celebrating Bangsgiving!
Why can't you let me just have this, you guys? Please.
Okay. You've been talking about this for, like, a week, Schmidt.
We get it. Let's just pick names already. Jess, I can't believe that you are into Bangsgiving.
I just want to meet a guy so I can forget about Ryan.
Just date him, Jess.
'Cause I'm his boss, and it's against the rules for me to date him.
Just date him. It's a dumb rule.
It's against the rules.
Take the hat.
Oh.
Now, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.
And no date leaves until everyone is laid.
I just want to meet a nice fella.
Can I have permission to send them home without sex?
No, you do not.
I think everybody's date should be able to leave.
Nick: Yeah, your plan sounds a little kidnappy.
What's the rule on that, Winston?
Eh, gray area. We're good.
Winston is in. My man. And, okay, nobody say who you picked. It'll ruin the surprise.
Oh, crap. You picked me.
No! How'd you know?
And now you're gonna set me up with you, aren't you?
Cece, I-I know that this holiday is a bittersweet memory for your people, Wrong kind of Indian. but, please, do not take that out on me.
Okay, well, I picked you, too, so I want to re-pick.
No re-picking. And no more telling.
So, listen up, uh, for whoever picked me, I just want you to know that I have really gotten into feet lately, so do with that what you will.
No one do anything with that.
Can I just say no mustaches?
I'd like someone tall.
She's got to have an ass.
Can I just reiterate the whole feet thing?
I want to say who I picked so bad.
I'm looking for a fake redhead. With a medium-sized neck.
I just want to be slapped around.
So, Pearl, I told Winston that you work at my school.
And, um, Winston is about to become a cop, which you've probably already gathered from the fact that he pinned his badge to his sport coat.
What? (chuckles)
How did that get there?
Let me freshen your drink. (chuckles)
Excuse me a second.
(whispering): Hey, Coach. Coach.
Look at what Jess brought me.
Oh, Pearl? Yeah, she's great, man.
Hey, come here. You got something on your face.
Really? What is it?
It's, like, right...
What were you thinking, bringing me that girl from the police academy?
What's wrong with Pepper?
Allow me...
(chuckles) Arms!
She's jacked, dude. You should've warned me you were setting me up with one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
I'm sure she's not that bad.
Whoa.
Where was she when I was cracking walnuts for the stuffing?
Look, she's fantastic. She's beautiful.
You're gonna love her.
Now, if you jerks will excuse me, this Bishop's got to capture himself a queen.
She's doing push-ups.
For your lady.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Jess.
Pearl, she's... Yeah, she's great.
What grade does she teach?
Oh, she doesn't teach. She's the lunch lady.
You said the lunch lady?
Yeah.
So where exactly is this "date" of mine?
All right, I invited Lucy, like you asked.
Your date's name is Geoff and he will be here. By the way, he spells Geoff with a "G," so you know he comes from money.
Nick: Well, I think the real difference is crocodiles are man-eaters and alligators...
What in the bloody hell?
Uh, hey, Nick. What is Tran doing here?
Oh, well, I picked my own name.
So you said to bring somebody. So I thought it'd be weird if I didn't bring someone. So I just brought Tran.
You brought an old Asian man to my sex party so it wouldn't be weird?
Relax. He didn't come empty-handed.
He brought a game. It's like Thailand Monopoly.
Yeah, all the squares are jail except for one piece of property which we all have to fight each other for.
But don't get caught in the Red Light District.
This isn't a freaking game night, Nick.
Okay, chill out.
(knocking) You... You're making a mockery of this holiday and you know it.
I didn't mean to make fun of Thailand, if that's where you're from even.
Hey.
Lucy.
It's so good to see you.
How are you?
Oh, I'm great.
Lucy? Lucy's here with Schmidt?
Where's my set-up, already? I'm looking at the menu, and I see a lot of skirt but no steak.
I think that Coach picked you, so watch out.
'Cause I'm sure he's gonna bring one of his clients or weird, like, gym buddies.
(whispering): Ryan.
What?
Ryan. Ryan.
Ryan-Ryan?
He brought Ryan. Oh, God.
I don't think I can even look at him, like, without getting pregnant.
He just oozes sex.
Good holiday to you! I've come with biscuits!
(groaning)
Hey, hey, hey, Schmidt, Lucy?
I-I used to date Lucy.
Oh, I know, bro.
I met her that day you gave me the pass to your gym.
Hey, do you have any snacks?!
Yeah, you blew her off. I didn't think it would be a problem.
Oh, it's a problem. I'm telling you it's a problem.
And I forbid you from dating her, so... (whistles) cut it off.
Grounds?
The statute of limitation hasn't expired.
You dated her three years ago for, like, two and a half months.
The statute is very specific. 1,000 showers.
After that, no claim. And if you think I've showered 1,000 times in the past three years, then you're out of your mind.
Did you ever spend more than $65 on her, not including tip?
It's tough. There were a lot of coupons involved.
Did you ever watch her dog?
Trick question: she had fish and I k*lled them.
You ever get her a gift?
Every time we had sex.
(laughs) No claim.
(laughs) No claim?
Hi, Nick. It's been a long time.
Lucille. Great to see you.
Do you still like to eat, uh... popcorn?
I guess so.
Oh, you see that? I know her foods.
You must have spoiled her, huh?
You know, if you'll excuse us, I'm gonna give Lucy the tour.
Come on, Lucy.
I'm calling my penis "the tour."
My tour's more satisfying.
His is all about him. Mine's about you sometimes.
Hi.
Hi. Uh, thanks for inviting me tonight.
I-I didn't realize this was a singles party.
Oh. No. Uh, s-sorry.
Did Coach say that with a Sean Connery accent?
Did he say "shingles"? 'Cause he was...
He actually meant shingles. Like the... Like...
The... Everybody here is a roofer.
Look, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.
I know that. We both know that.
But this can't happen. Are we attracted to each other? Yes!
Do I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me? I do.
But my job is to enforce the rules.
And I love my job, and I worked hard to get it. So this cannot happen.
Is that why you locked me in your bedroom, and undone the top button of your dress?
I didn't undo the top...
Well, I did...
But that was an accident. That wasn't for you.
It was for me.
I just need to know that you will respect the rules and that this will go no further.
I'll do my best.
Looks like you missed a few.
What?
Okay, I summoned everyone to the roof because Bangsgiving is in peril.
All of you are focusing on things that have nothing to do with getting laid.
Let us please not repeat the mistakes that we made at my Eight Nights of Hump-akah party.
Now, what is the freakin' problem?
Coach did the opposite of what I asked.
Come on, Jess, you guys would be great together.
It's a dumb rule, all right? Dumb rule.
At least he turns you on. Pepper makes my ding-dong and my ping-pongs go into my body.
Can somebody help me with this keg?
Yeah, sure.
Pepper's got it.
(grunts)
What if she doesn't know her own strength down there, and she mushes it, or, Be a nightmare. like, rips it off and throws it across the room like a hot dog?
That's nothing. Jess brought me a hot lunch lady.
What am I supposed to do with that?
Do sex with the lunch lady.
Wait.
That's obvious. I have a real...
I know how it sounds. I know how it sounds, but she's a... like, a real lunch lady.
That's hot.
A woman that's willing, ready and able...
Nick: That's not an issue.
After she has sex with you, she can put food in your mouth.
That's not a problem at all. I do have a real problem.
Schmidt is trying to sleep with a woman I've already slept with.
Well, at least he has a date, because mine never showed up.
Geoff is coming! Apparently, a wild peacock got loose on the freeway, and is holding up traffic.
Now, you guys, we have guests downstairs.
And if we don't get back to them soon, they're gonna get spooked.
Um, so, have you always been from England?
I'm not going downstairs until Schmidt agrees to not sleep with Lucy.
Okay, yeah, sure. Never!
According to the statute, if you two can't agree, we take it to a vote.
The winner gets the girl, the loser gets five grilled cheese sandwiches.
Nick: I'll agree to that.
Let's do it.
All right, all those in favor of Schmidt not sleeping with Lucy, raise your hand now.
I don't care.
Couldn't care less.
Raise 'em up.
Put 'em up.
Huzzah! Warning: tonight things will get loud with Lucy.
But don't worry. I'll have her jam a sock in my mouth right before I see angels.
Okay, guys, what about me?
Get your own sock.
No. What am I gonna do about Ryan?
Just have sex with him.
Look, bang one out, get it out of your system.
I don't do that.
You should do that.
You should bang one out.
Yeah, makes the most sense.
What?!
Nothing else has worked, okay, and the best way to get over a crush is just to do something about it.
I don't know.
Plus, he's British, so you know the sex will be weirdly polite.
(with British accent): Do you mind if I finish now?
He doesn't sound like Oliver Twist.
(British accent): Do you like that? Is that good, eh?
All right. Here we go.
One... really? Two... what?
Do you mind if I do it like that?
Hey, you like it when I do it like that, eh?
That was spot-on.
All those in favor of Jess doing Ryan, raise your hand.
(talking quietly)
Oh, he's trying to mess with me?
Here I go.
Cecilia.
No, you cannot have my beer.
(laughs)
Nick: You think I'm going after the beer.
You okay?
Mm.
Okay, great.
(groans)
(talks quietly)
(phone buzzing)
(gasps)
Happy Bangsgiving.
(whispers): Close the door.
Oh, my God.
Is there nothing underneath that apron?
Just a little white meat looking for some gravy.
That probably wasn't very sexy. I shouldn't have said that!
No, it was very becoming.
I'm totally confused about these oven mitts.
How else am I supposed to take a hot dish out of the oven?
These mitts were a bad idea.
What, uh, got you in the-the, uh, holiday, uh, sp-spirit?
Well, I like you, you like me.
Why don't we just... bang one out of our system?
Bang one out of our system?
It sounds really bad. I get that.
And I hear it now, it sounds awful.
But we just bang one out of our system, and then, we can go back to our strictly professional relationship, and I can stop thinking about you all the time, which I do.
I didn't come here to bang one out.
Well, you know what I mean.
Look...
I care about you.
Well...
Jess, I'm crazy about you.
Ryan, look. Oh, God, it's so complicated.
Can I just put some pants on when we talk about this?
It is complicated.
This would have been worth it.
Oh, God. Ryan. Ryan!
Oh, God!
Nick: Oh! Yeah!
(hooting, whooping and overlapping chatter)
Oh, no!
Freaking Bangsgiving.
Schmidt: No, I actually put those in there myself.
I'll tell you, I wouldn't eat asparagus though.
It makes your pee smell.
(laughs) Mmm.
Hey, Cece, I got that $20 I owe you.
It's, uh... it's in my bedroom.
Okay.
Yeah, it's right this way.
You're really sexy for a Jew.
Not now, woman!
Wait. What?
Who needs men? You don't need a man.
You can lift your own furniture.
Hey, Pepper.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
I am so sorry. You approached my blind spot.
Your money is in her somewhere. Let me just find it.
Great.
Oh!
What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself?
No, it's just not there. Let me... Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooh, ohh, that feels so good!
When I'm looking for your money, it feels so good.
I love that!
(loudly) You nasty woman! (softly) Cause you are making me give the money to you.
Oh, Cece, you love this!
Getting your money.
What exactly are you doing right now?
Getting your money.
You are definitely not getting my money, in no world you have my money.
I was flirting with you to give Schmidt a taste of his own medicine, okay, and it's a huge mistake and insulting to everyone involved, and I'm sorry.
Yeah, and also he would never fall for that, at all, okay...
You are a d*ad man Miller!
Don't, don't.
I'll choke you to d*ad.
I'll choke you to...
Barely fighting. Schmidt, nothing was going on.
He was just trying to make you jealous.
Please, I know that!
He would never h*t on you.
You are on my Never List.
I know she...
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?
You pissed me for bringing Lucy, and you bring Tran as a date?
Leave Tran out of this, he fought in Korea.
I don't know which side, but I know he is a w*r hero.
You couldn't find one of those drunk girls at the bar?
The ones with no family or friends. That's your sweet spot, man.
I know, I could have. I didn't want to.
Why not?
What kind of women have you been sleeping since you and Jess broke up?
Terrible ones.
And how does that make you feel?
Terrible.
Then reaaly good.
Expected, expected.
There you go.
And then immediately after terrible.
Just gonna put this out there, but I think you'd probably rather like to sleep with someone who doesn't make you feel terrible, but, you're just a little afraid of getting hurt again.
Nah, it didn't sound right.
You know, growing up we had this lunch lady named Miss Wheaton.
One day, I cut in line, so I can get actual tater tots.
And as punishment, she made me eat the entire tray.
In front of her.
While she's stared at me, for a long period of time.
And I'm not sure if you know how hard that is for a growing boy.
How old were you?
I was 18.
(chuckles)
If it helps, we're called lunch monitor now.
No one says lunch lady anymore.
(chuckles) Kind of like how you can't call little people "shrinkies".
Oh, lunch monitor Pearl, I like you.
Excellent form.
You don't have a hard job.
So, I saw your butt earlier. It's been holding up nicely.
It does the trick.
And I noticed, uh, Ryan left.
Yeah. Ugh! It's so embarrassing.
I kind of came onto him, and he told me he wanted more than just sex.
He wanted more than sex and that's a bad thing? How?
Well, look, I'm his boss.
We could get sued, and I could get fired.
There's a reason it's against the rules.
You gotta br... okay.
Remember when we tried to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
Okay, I stick by that... that kid is not a hero.
All he does is break rules. What's so great about that?
You're taking Rooney's side. No one takes Rooney's side.
I'm a vice principal... Rooney is my people.
Ferris hijacks a parade.
That is an act of terror.
You want to know what I think, 'cause you're not going to like it.
What?
I don't think this is about breaking rules.
I think Ryan scares you.
You like him, and you're going to have to put yourself out there again, and that scares you.
But look, life moves really fast.
And if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you just might miss it.
Is that from Ferris Bueller?
Yes, it is.
Okay.
It's a terrific movie.
All right.
And I delivered it perfectly.
It was pretty good.
What are you doing here?
You're fired.
(laughs) Just kidding.
Oh, God.
You left without eating so I thought, um...
I'd bring you a pie. Well, most of a pie.
The guys ate some of it. That's a lie.
I ate-I ate-I ate a piece on the way over.
I-I ate two pieces.
Three pieces.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Would you like to come inside?
No, um, I came here to say something and that this...
I want more, too.
This dish is empty.
Okay. I ate the whole pie.
Look, I don't know what I'm doing or where this is going (sighs) and I'm scared, but... it's worth it 'cause it feels big.
And that's why I'm going to leave right now, and we're going to take it slow.
Wow.
Well, tonight is Bangsgiving, and I have to honor my American traditions.
It's my duty as an American...
I think I'm going to stop being afraid and start dating.
You probably knew all along, didn't you?
If only I could meet a girl like you, Tran.
Your face, your brain... throw it in a dress.
Oh, daddy, I'd be with her forever.
I'm getting off topic.
Thanks for the talk. I feel a lot better.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tran, are these all yours?
Come on, man.
I thought you were switching to white wine.
How do you think you're going to get home now?
You're not driving, so how are you going to get home?
(knocking)
Hey.
Are you Nick?
You the guy who's obsessed with my grandfather?
Grandpaps, you ready to go?
Hey.
(screams)
Ah, ah, ha... hey.
I'm taking off. Um... sorry I body-slammed you but this doesn't feel like it's working out so I don't really want to waste our time.
Look, Pepper, um...
I think you're beautiful, and very nice.
I just, uh...
You know, I'm not used to... dating women that are stronger than me.
How do you know that I'm stronger than you?
Do you want to arm wrestle?
Yeah, like I'm that insecure that I have to prove my masculinity by arm wrestling a girl.
(yells) Come on.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
(grunting)
(yells)
Yes! That's how you do it!
That's how it's uh-uh-uh done!
(moaning)
(giggling)
Thank you for letting me win.
Sure. Anytime.
Well, Lucy left.
Turns out she's a bit of an anti-Semite.
Hmm.
Yeah, looks like we both struck out.
Okay, Schmidt, there is no Geoff.
Come on. But to honest, I'm kind of glad there isn't.
You know, Thanksgiving should be spent with the people that you care about.
Let me get you a beer.
By the way... you're on my Never List, too.
Hi.
Are you Cece?
I'm Geoff.
Um, I'm Schmidt's friend.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I h*t a peacock on my way here and then I held it in my arms until it d*ed.
It was horrible, but also kind of uplifting.
Um, anyway, I brought creamed spinach.

Ed Rooney.
Ed. This is George Peterson.
How are you today, sir?
It's not him Rooney.
This movie should be called "The Day Rooney Trying To Do His Job".
Oh, the female reproductive system.
Kind of looks like the Chicago Bulls symbol.
It does.
Now, this is the only part that matters.
The money train. Sure.
Hey, I call it my nine-to-five.
'Cause it's my job to work it. You know what I'm saying?
(laughter)
The large intestine, you degenerates.
What?
Let me see that.
I told Jess that I don't want to teach health.
I'm not good at it. Such a hassle.
Studying, planning, giving weak kids good grades. No.
I heard that. There are good things, too. Like you get to come with me to a dope two-day teaching conference in Palmdale.
I want to stay and hang out with the guys at Guys' Night. - What's Guys' Night?
Oh, yeah, we're celebrating you being gone. No offense.
Guys' Night!
Guys' Night!
Guys' Night!
The conference is gonna be really fun. We just have to work from, like, 9:00 to 7:00.
And then after that it's a par-tay.
Until 10:00, when quiet hours are strictly enforced.
But before then we rage. For three hours.
Actually, two because there's the half an hour of setup time and the half an hour of cleanup time because we have to actually be in bed at 10:00.
Cece: Ooh!
Are you kidding me?
Ryan is going?
Ryan-Ryan? The guy you have a crazy crush on?
I had a crush on him. Principal Foster says that administrators can't date teachers. It's forbidden.
That makes it so much hotter.
It makes it crazy hotter. But, look, it's not just about Principal Foster.
This is about how I worked really hard to get to Vice Principal, and I'm not gonna let some British guy get in my way.
Some redcoat bastard.
That's why I keep all of our interactions strictly professional.
Hey. How was your weekend?
That's personal.
I can't risk learning any personal details about him.
What if he taught his dyslexic sister how to read?
I can't know that. I'll go crazy with lust.
My pants will turn to ash.
And so exactly how do you plan to avoid this man that you are trapped in the same hotel with?
There are, like, a thousand p*rn that start that way.
Yeah, but no p*rn have teachers.
Every p*rn has a teacher.
Well, I'm not worried, okay?
'Cause I'll probably never even see him.
Jess?
Can you believe we're right next to each other?
Hey, you guys want sangria?
It's Guys' Night!
Only beer!
Yeah, what is this, Spain?
Great sangria burn, man.
Really?
Never let your guard down!
Aah!
Oh, takedown!
Never let your guard down.
Well played.
All right, first up, we eat meat.
How much meat?!
Then we take a fart nap.
Not for me. Pass.
All right, guys, it's Guys' Night. Let's think.
Okay.
Anything else we can't do when Jess is here.
Wow.
Look at that stretching.
I don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.
I wouldn't touch them. They'd want for nothing. But I would know they were there.
Stretching. For me.
I want to French braid that girl hair.
I want to French braid that hair so good.
The third hottest one just waved at me. Hello!
Ah!
Ooh!
Oh, no.
Oh!
No!
No, no, no!
Oh...
-Jess is gonna k*ll you.
sh**t! She's not gonna k*ll me.
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have it cleaned, I'll have it cleaned.
Schmidt, red wine sets.
Shut up, Winston! It sets.
Why don't you just wash it?
Why don't I just what?
Wash it.
Just wash the blanket.
Unless you can't.
Come on, man. Get out of here.
I've known you for a lot of years and I've never seen you do laundry.
Never seen me do laundry... Get out of town.
Wait, wait. Is that true?
Come on, you guys, this is so...
Really, this is silly.
Then do it.
Right now.
We'll watch.
Doing the laundry...
It's no problemo.
Little bit of this.
What in the world...?
Straining the soap.
Get that in there.
Back in there.
Um, okay.
And...
That's it. Laundry.
Can't... Oh, so silly.
Forgot to put the quarters in.
That's right, the quarters.
Schmidt...
All right! I don't know how to do laundry!
I knew it!
Forget it.
Finally!
That is insane!
Hope you're happy.
Nerd. Nerd.
Dud.
Lady nerd. Goofus.
Virgin...
Hey, Coach, I need you to be my buffer!
Okay, but Nick can never find out about this.
Wait, what? Hmm?
What?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I need you to be my buffer between Ryan and me.
He's so sexy.
Really?
Yeah.
That guy?
Beautiful. Did you make that?
Looks like a Boys Department mannequin.
Yeah.
Hey, Jess, can I, um...
Nope.
No time for chatting.
We have to sit down.
You can't sit there.
Coach likes to sit in the middle.
Mm-hmm.
I sit bitch or I don't sit at all.
(whispering): You're weird. (whispering): You're weird.
You're a weirdo.
You're weird.
You're weird.
You're weird.
Shh.
I am education guru Brenda Brown.
Coach: Oh, no. Who is this? She looks like one of those ladies who talks you into having a baby in a tub.
You. the talker.
Mmm...
Stand up.
Talk to us.
There were other people talking, I just want to let you know that.
Why are you a teacher?
Uh, 'cause my... my roommate made me.
Hmm.
What?
I'm worried about you.
You're a worry.
Wor... why, why are you worried about me?
Teaching is an awesome responsibility.
You are not prepared for it. Sit down.
Okay.
Today, we will learn about our fellow educators, their hopes, their dreams, their bitter regrets.
The things they wish they'd said to their birth mother...
So, partner up.
Will you be my partner?
Mmm, sorry, I'm with Coach.
No, I can't do it.
I'm going to the bar. What?
Buffer out. Buffer out.
No, buffer in.
Buffer in. Buffer in. Buffer out.
Everything okay here?
Yeah, sorry.
My, um... my partner just left.
Or... did your partner just arrive?
Oh. Um... No...
Wicked.
Everyone!
Look at your partner, really look.
Take his or her hand and say, "I'm excited!"
I'm excited.
Oh, crap.
(knocking at door)
We just came to say we're sorry.
Guess you think I'm pretty dim, huh?
A man who can't do laundry.
You weren't born this way, were you?
Born not knowing how to do laundry?
Like everyone else?
Yes, Winston, I was. It wasn't till after birth that the trouble really began.
Here we go.
Schmidt: Nana wouldn't let me in the laundry room.
I think it's because my hands were always covered in butter.
And so I went to college unable to do laundry.
I'm making jean shorts!
I'm doing laundry!
Big day for both of us!
Yeah, it is.
As I pulled out my maternity corduroys, I spied a six-pack of Pi-Phis.
I need... um...
I need them loose to keep... to keep my sperm count up.
You know how it is!
Eventually, the window of time when it was acceptable to learn something so basic had closed.
I was an adult.
It was too late.
Well, I understand.
You know, I've never told anyone this, but, um...
I don't know how to read a ruler.
I don't, I mean, how do you start?
At the edge or the first tick?
It's confusing to me.
Are you serious?
Do you know how to count?
It always gets on top of me, and 'Cause then you should know how to use a ruler, you idiot!
I'm an idiot? You can't even wash your own underwear, you dumbass.
Hey! They're both super easy!
We're talking about laundry and a ruler!
I'm gonna teach you guys right now!
Let's go.
Each of you holds a stack of cards with questions for your partners.
You must uncover the answers. Begin.
What gets you out of bed in the morning?
Let me guess.
Your mother, who you live with, says, "Ryan, your crumpets are getting cold."
The thought that any ordinary day could be the day I look back on when I'm much older as being the best day of my life.
You?
Same.
Don't look away.
Embrace the intimacy...
I'm good.
Embrace the intimacy.
Okay.
You know, I think there's an art to a picnic basket.
Apricot jam would never go with a sesame cr*cker.
Of course it wouldn't, it would go with Both: a flaky baguette.
Duck, duck. Okay, now step forward, step forward, another step forward; okay, go to your right, go to your right.
Do you scrapbook?
On rainy days.
Step forward, go to your left; left, left.
Big step, that's it, big step; now come to me, another big step; come to me.
Do you own yarn?
Spools of it.
I craft so much.
It's a left, and again come to me, come to me.
Yes.
Come to me.
Oh!
Oh!
It's okay, I've got you.
We have a new record.
He's amazing.
I think he might be an angel sent down to Earth like Denzel Washington in The Preacher's Wife.
Oh, honey, okay, what can I do?
In your purse, you will find a white envelope.
Okay, you, you wrote a letter to yourself, and stuck it in my purse?
Read it, I need to hear it.
"Dear Jess, If you are reading this, it's because you're being an idiot and developing feelings for your employee, you ballet-flat-wearing piece of Oregon trash."
You are so right. You are so right.
"To have intercourse with the first man hired under your reign would be an insult to yourself and also..."
This part's in caps.
...all women everywhere."
All women everywhere.
"Did you learn nothing from the movie Elizabeth, you stupid little bitch?"
No one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects.
I will paint my face white.
No man may have me.
Thank you, Cece.
You're welcome?
Teaching is such a pain in the ass.
Isn't it?
I'll tell you what, I wouldn't give it up for anything.
You get to really impact those kids' lives.
I'm not gonna impact them, I'm just teaching health.
"Just health"?
Hey, Carol.
Hey, Ned.
Oh, it's Carol.
Oh, hey, Carol.
Health is the most important subject.
Screw up, and they "just" get pregnant.
What's your safe sex lesson plan?
I don't know!
Uh, lie to them and say condoms feel good?
Uh, maybe tell them about my buddy who's got bumps on his thing?
Maybe bring up Magic Johnson.
Maybe bring up Kobe Bryant.
You're my best friend in the whole world, but I'm really worried about you.
You think the line is a suggestion?
I don't know what it is...
It isn't!
Do it again.
It's too hard!
Do it again!
Okay, so you start with the first tick.
Oh...
That's it, really.
Stop!
That was at the line!
That was perfect.
Now do it ten more times.
So in the beginning, you never mind the edge.
Yeah.
Man.
You got to hold on to it.
What about bleach?
Let's walk before we can run, huh, pal?
Hey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!
(laughs) Man, that is way too soon.
Warm-warm, warm-cold...
You got this, don't get flustered!
Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot? It's hot-hot!
It's always warm-cold.
Well, what's "permanent press"?
Fake button, nobody uses it.
Yeah, don't press that one.
(buzzing) The machine is buzzing, you didn't close it!
What?! Yeah, I closed it!
Who you gonna believe, me or the machine?!
I'm gonna believe the machine!
(grunts)
This is bull!
(buzzing stops)
Damn it, you!
We're so close.
Take ten and relax.
Nine-inch bottle.
Rappers be lying.
You told me to relax, so...
Self-pleasure is the only thing that relaxes me.
Ugh. Seriously, Schmidt?
That is crass.
I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear it.
So stupid.
Hey, you did it!
You did it!
Yes!
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about!
Guys' Night!
Hey.
Oh, hey.
I saved you a seat.
Oh! No.
I've been offered a seat at the higher-ups' table.
The tastemakers.
You're not invited.
Oh, I see. You're back to avoiding me.
I'm not av... I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do. You've been avoiding me for weeks at school.
That's why I was so happy that we were finally getting a chance to, I don't know, maybe get to know each other.
What, is this summer camp?
We don't need to get to know each other.
What's your problem with me?
Did I do something to offend you?
Why do... I... I don't have a problem.
You have a problem with me.
I don't have a problem with you.
Yes, you do, you have a problem.
Do you have a problem?
No, I don't have a problem.
Great, then we bothdon't have a problem.
We have a problem.
Coach: Hey, Jess!
Buffer on the roof!
(laughs)
I'm freaking out.
Freakin', freakin' out.
Freak, freak, freak. (dog barks)
Is that a baby? I feel like I hear a baby.
All right, gentlemen... bar crawl.
Man, look at this, I know how to do laundry!
I feel like a new man.
Good, good, good.
There is no way for me to express my joy.
Except by telling you the width of my smile.
(giggles)
(chuckles)
I can't read it, somebody else read it.
No, I want to do it, I want to do it, hold on.
But I can't see, let me turn it... uh...
You know what? To Nick.
What can't you do?
A lot, you know, I can't say "Frebuary."
(laughs) No one can!
Frebuar... Febuar-ar...
Feb.. I... (babbles)
Whatever.
Feb... February.
Yeah, it's February.
I can't say the alphabet unless I'm singing the song.
And I never learned how to love.
But enough about me... Guys' Night!
Let's go, gentlemen.
Winston: Man, that is... that is heavy.
Hey, Nick, that's something we should talk about.
I mean, what are we gonna do, sit around all night and talk about love?
(laughs)
Winston and Schmidt: ♪ I want to know what love is ♪
♪ I want you to show me ♪
♪ Ooh... ♪
♪ I want to know what love is ♪
♪ Oh... ♪
♪ And I want you to sh... ♪
♪ I know you can show me ♪
Sad song.
Hey, buddy.
Hey!
Jess: What's happening?
I freaked out about the whole teaching health thing, and then I went and I-I got drunk with Ned...
Neddy!
And then I bet everybody in the bar that I could do a backflip off the roof, and that's what I came to do.
So...
Hey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, I... I totally understand how you're feeling.
Yeah? Does, uh, teaching scare the crap out of you, Jess?
Well, it is my life's calling, so, no.
Exactly.
You don't get it.
I do.
What's up, player?
It's the British dude.
This is my first time teaching, and I'm scared, too.
It's a terribly important job.
Yeah, but health is the most... (all gasping)
I'm good.
Health is the most important subject on Earth.
Yes, it is important.
'Cause you know kids, they're always wanting to have sex with each other.
They don't know that it just feels good for a second and then you're sad.
And that's why we need someone great, someone strong, who the kids trust.
Okay.
Someone who can yell at them about chlamydia.
That does... that sounds like... like something Coach would do.
You can teach.
I can teach, guys!
That's mostly what I was trying to tell you.
No one needs to worry about me anymore!
No! (all screaming)
Oh, my God.
I'll get him.
No.
Yes.
Don't do anything heroic right now.
(all gasp, exclaim)
(gasping for air)
(cheering)
This guy's amazing.
Nick, Winston and Schmidt: ♪ Hello ♪
♪ Is it me you're looking for? ♪
♪ I can see it in your... ♪
I want to be the someone that somebody is looking for.
-♪ In your smile... ♪
But what do I have to offer?
Do not talk about yourself like that.
Come on, guys, what do I bring to the table?
That's easy, man.
You're the cute one.
What?
That's right.
Look, I'm the smart one, Winston's the silly one, Coach is the sports one, and you're the cute one.
Well, if I were so cute, then how come I can't find anyone to love?
'Cause you're aiming too low.
Nick, my man, you don't find diamonds underground.
That's exactly where you find diamonds, Winston.
Let's... can we not...
This is not about gems, okay?
This is about Nick valuing himself enough to aim for the top.
Now, I-I've been to the top of the mountain, with Cece, and it was glorious up there.
And you know, one of these days... could be tomorrow...
I'm gonna be a millionaire.
If I don't have Cece, then what do I have?
You got a million dollars.
If I'm being honest, you guys, uh...
I'm worried about being a cop.
Sure.
You know, what if I see something really bad and then it... it changes me?
You know, it makes me lose my faith and then I become really bad?
You guys really think I'm the cute one?
You know what's not cute?
Pretending that you don't know that you are.
Schmidt, this sangria is just delicious.
Thanks, man.
I'm jealous of that little orange in there.
It gets to just drink all the sangria it wants.
Yeah. I'm probably gonna...
I'm gonna eat the orange, too.
Guys' Night.
Guys' Night!
(bl*wing)
(whistles)
(whistles)
It's like instant world music.
(tones harmonizing)
(laughing)
Wait, shh.
Why "shh"?
I think he's finally...
(Coach snores) asleep.
Asleep.
(giggles)
Cheers.
Chin-chin.
Um...
Hey...
I'm sorry.
I was a little bit of a jerk to you earlier.
No, it's fine.
I'm used to jerks.
I used to work in finance.
Oh! Finance!
Mm-hmm.
Really?
Why did you leave?
I know this sounds silly, but I realized that the only time I'd been really happy in my life was teaching my little sister how to read.
She suffers from crippling dyslexia.
Oh, God!
What?
You're just... so perfect.
Well, it's more common than you might think.
No, you're like the most perfect person I've ever met. And it's like you're an angel who's been sent down to the Earth, like... have you ever seen the movie The Preacher's Wife?
Anyway, I just have this big, stupid crush on you.
I... didn't say that.
No, it's fine. It's-it's...
Shouldn't have said... No.
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry, um...
I need a bucket.
Now!
Um, you should go.
I need a bucket!
(gags) Just go.
No, let me help, please. Let me help.
No, just go, just go, just go.
Coach: Ugh, gettin' the mouth sweats.
Oh, I need a bucket!
Just go.
Just go. Just go.
Okay.
Why is there ice in here?
More room... (sighs) for what's about to happen...
Oh, God...
Oh, my God!
When I get home I'm hitting the books.
I am going to crush health.
Yeah, you are.
Yeah.
Ned!
Let me get his contact before we leave.
What?
Ned! I need details, bro!
Hey, man. Am I gonna get your e-mail?
What's gonna happen here?
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.
Let's do it, let's do it.
Yeah.
It's therealned8(a)guhmail.com.
At guhmail... you mean Gmail?
Oh, is that how you say it?
Um... (chuckles)
Good morning.
Good morning.
Can I, um... talk to you about last night?
No, I want to talk to you about last night, because I said some things, um, that don't reflect how I really feel about you.
Um... so I'd really appreciate it if you could strike them from the record.
It was the conference talking, not me.
Consider them struck.
Thank you.
Enjoy your Thanksgiving vacation.
It's, uh, an American holiday where we celebrate the fact that we... didn't know how to farm by ourselves.
Are you curious to know how I really feel about you?
No.
Because if you were interested, I'd tell you that I won't enjoy my Thanksgiving because I won't get to see you every day.
I think you're beautiful and totally insane, and when I'm at work, I can't focus, because I can't get you out of my head.
Coach: Hey.
Hey, uh, you guys want to stop on the way home and get some pancakes?
Hey, what do you call them in England?
Roundy-yums.
Really?
No.
See you after the holidays.
Oh, boy.
You didn't see anything!
Where'd your lipstick go?
h*t 'em! h*t 'em!
From the back.
h*t 'em!
Ugh!
It smells terrible in here!
How many beers did you guys drink?
So much.
Beer, beer! Lots of beer.
Just a lot of beer.
That's how beer smells.
So many beers.
(sniffs)
Smells like sangria.
Schmidt: That must be the perfume from all the ladies we hooked up with. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
They were all Spaniards.
Winston: Mine was named Señorita Lucinda Madrid.
Say, how was the conference?
It was just... stupid... conferences...
Ugh.
So, she finally hooked up with Ryan.
He put his teeth behind her teeth.
Wow!
Aah!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What the hell did you guys do to my blanket?
Gentlemen!
Three months ago I bravely reentered the dating pool, and how has this city rewarded me? With an endless parade of weirdo ass clowns. Hard to say who was the worst. Comedy magician. This guy with the little ding dang. The lion tamer.
Never went out with a lion tamer.
I am having some vivid dreams.
The point is Ian has asked me out on a third date, and this is the biggest compliment I could give.
I want to go. Because I like him.
Booh!
That's not a reason.
And frankly it's been a while, and the third date is where, # mama gets her biscuit. #
(chuckles)
Mama gets her biscuit.
I don't understand.
It's sex.
Oh!
Yeah!
Now, that's a reason!
Anyway, I'm bringing him home tonight, so let's keep those toilets flushed.
That means stick around. Take a second look.
How'd you tell Ian about the fun surprise that you still live with your ex?
All right.
Well, I haven't told him yet.
Uh, tricky conversation.
I'm thinking of something simple like, "Hey, Ian, I live with my ex."
No. No, no. When a guy hears that, he is going to run through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.
Here's a fun idea. You can put a hat on him with antlers.
This way, the hole he makes in the wall will make us all smile.
Nick brings home girls all the time.
There's no problem.
No complaints here.
It'll make you forget every botanical garden you've ever seen.
I live with my ex-girlfriend.
And after the farmer's market...
I live with my ex.
Let's have sex again.
I live with my ex.
(sighs)
Damn it. Too quick.
Hey, if you're looking to scare somebody off, it's basically a gold mine.
Nobody cares that we're exes who live together.
(groans) I got to go.
Okay, that doesn't prove anything.
Just for the record, I'm leaving 'cause you live with your ex.
It's gross. And disgusting.
And I'm gonna steal some stuff.
Take what you want, honey.
Coach: We don't read those anymore.
(door closes)
Nick, who are these girls?
They're not the best.
Jess, guys hate complicated situations.
We want the path of least resistance.
There's a flap in our underwear because we are too lazy to pull our underpants down.
No offense, Nick, but...
Ian's a little different from you or the women you bring home.
The... tavern folk.
Have some respect. They're called Uh-Ohs.
And I've been through a lot of names: Pork Pals.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Bone Cronies, Right.
C-Plussy Hussies.
Very reverent.
But "Uh-Oh" takes it off of them and back onto me where it belongs.
I made the mistake, not them. They're great.
You really are a prince among men, Nick.
Aw, that's awfully nice. I feel like I'm maturing.
All I'm saying is that, somehow, Ian is even more mature than you are.
And that's why I think he'll understand when I tell him in a mature adult way I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about.
Can I suggest a tweak?
Fine.
"I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about because he's gay now."
No.
"Because he has weeks to live."
No.
"Because he's already d*ad."
What?
Then I'll act like a ghost.
No.
(imitating ghost): Consider it.
No.
Come on.
That's the worst ghost impression I've ever heard.
This is the worst ghost impression you've ever heard?
(imitating ghost): I'm a ghost.
(scoffs) There's way worse.
(Winston humming softly)
Anything for me?
Oh, no, this isn't our mail. This is our neighbors' mail.
You see, Viv likes it alphabetized.
Yet Michelle likes it according to size. (chuckles)
Hashtag "go figure," right?
Hashtag "did you see how I rhymed?"
I want to choke you until your eyes literally pop out of your head.
Those girls are not going to sleep with you.
They are hot. And nothing is less hot than a male secretary.
(imitates record scratching)
What?
I think somebody needs to take a good long look at Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.
Dude's eyes are so pouchy he can barely see anything, and he's still k*lling it.
Girls don't have sex with guys who sort their mail.
I am playing the long game here, Coach, weaving myself into the fabric of their lives.
Pretty soon I'll be as permanent as the will that I helped them draw up.
Oh, Winston, thank God you're here.
The toilet won't flush.
Did you jiggle the handle?
No, it's not working for us.
Here.
Oh.
I'm not here to do any chores.
You guys want to hang out tonight?
Sure.
Sure.
Right on.
Right on. That's what's up.
Winston: Coach, I really need my stilts and a plunger!
Eh, I don't care.
I'm happy to lend you a bra, but I don't think I have anything that would fit you.
That's the Peter Pan.
That'll smash 'em down good, but you'll never get those in there.
I know. I just wanted to see what it would feel like to be your size.
Are we doing, like, a boob Freaky Friday?
Because I don't want to lug yours around. They're a load.
I know. That's the whole point. That's why all the women in my family have back trouble, you know?
(groans)
So, now that I have insurance though, I was thinking maybe I could have, like, breast reduction surgery.
Schmidt (in distance): No!
(footsteps running)
(frantic knocking) I wonder who this is.
What?
It's a boob reduction, Schmidt.
Just accept it.
Acceptance is stage five.
I'm grieving, Cece. There are five stages of grief.
Stage one was denial.
This is not happening, this is not...
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
You're not getting a boob reduction.
Yes, I am.
This is not happening.
Yes, it is.
Stage two was anger.
Your breasts belong to all of us!
Okay.
Who are you to decide?!
Next will be stage four, depression.
And then stage five, acceptance.
But right now, I'm firmly planted in stage three, bargaining.
Dear God, if you stop Cece's breast reduction, Okay.
I'll circumcise Coach.
Whoa, Coach.
Go out with them tonight? Doesn't make any sense, man.
And compromise the long game? Ha.
Not until I replace their rocker switches with dimmers.
Forget your long game, Winston! Getting a girl to have sex with you is not about planning ahead.
It is about seizing opportunities that you never saw coming. It is instinct.
All right? It is improv.
It is jazz, man.
But with words. You dig? And the words are, "Oh, yeah, girl, I'm about to..."
(scatting loudly)
(phone vibrating)
(humming quietly)
(chuckles) Glen, my man, tell me something good.
And you better not be trying to sell me some non-dimmable halogens, you son of a...
Where you at? Are you kidding me?
(sighs)
Hey, buddy.
You know what you need to surround yourself with tonight?
Four new boobs.
On two different women?
You're damn right.
Take me to them.
(laughs)
Um, do you want to, like, go find a bar, grab a drink?
There's a bar that I like.
It's called... my place.
Great. Uh, is it... You think it'll be crowded?
You know I'm talking about my house, right?
Okay. Yeah, no, I wasn't... I thought that was just a clever name but now I do.
No.
And, yeah, let's go there.
(laughs)
Um, one thing I want to, uh, disclose to you in a very mature adult way, I... live with my ex.
Okay. Uh, yeah, you live with your ex.
Yeah.
But also three other guys.
It's more zany than sexy.
Okay. So it, like, wasn't really serious?
Oh, it was very serious.
Did you say "I love you"?
Not until he said it. (chuckles)
Uh, yeah, I don't think I can do this.
I'm sorry. I just...
What?
I've been on so many weird dates lately. I'm just looking for something easier.
I... No, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, look.
Yes, I live with my ex.
But there's nothing to worry about.
Because...
Nick. You're gay.
Huh?
You're gay.
Be gay. Be gay. Be gay.
Be gay?
Hey. (chuckles)
I just had to make sure these animals flushed.
Oh. Not you, you fastidious queen.
Oh, y-you must be Nick.
Well, friends call me Gay Nick.
My perfect Sunday, sitting here watching the game, eating a pot pie with a hot dude with no shirt on, on my lap kissing me.
Right on, man. Right on, man.
All right.
You got it.
(imitates expl*si*n)
Uh, can I use your restroom?
Yeah. It's down the hall to the right.
Don't worry. I won't peek.
But he wants to.
(chuckles)
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I should just tell him the truth.
It's too late for the truth, Jess.
You live with a gay man, and this gay man's gonna help you get laid.
Okay. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you think you can play a gay man?
I'm terrible at lying, I'm terrific at make-believe.
Okay.
Okay? But I need to know some backstory 'cause it's very important to me.
Okay. Yeah, backstory's important.
Okay.
Tell me, have I always known I was gay, or did I just recently realize it?
That's... Um, you-you always knew you were gay, but you grew up in an oil town where masculinity was the most valued currency.
Um, you-you had an older brother named Chip.
And Chip was a union guy.
Yes.
And if it wasn't about Teamster Local 11, Chip didn't want to hear about it.
Oh, my God, we're doing this.
When I came out, was it flashy?
Was it emotional?
Am I mad that Anderson Cooper doesn't fly the flag?
Or for what he's doing in his own way... is it even braver?
These are all really good questions, but I just can't get my mind off, like, why you dress this way.
Why aren't you in better shape?
Don't put me in a box!
There's nothing we gay men hate more than being put in a box.
Look, maybe I'm a bear, maybe I'm a twinkler.
That's not a category.
I like rugby for the game and for the men.
Now, if you excuse me, I got to go do that gay thing I was telling you about, because, of course, I'm gay as hell.
(laughs) Bye.
(whispers): That's not how gay men talk.
(whispers): I am shattering stereotypes.
What are you doing here, man?
Winston: I'm always here.
Very definition of the long game.
Coach: Forget your long game. It doesn't...
What is he...?
What are you doing, man?
Is this...?
Is this the fut... the future?
I can hold them both in one hand.
Yeah, man.
(sighs)
No, no, there it is. Look at that.
Stage four... depression.
My two best friends are going away.
Going away far too soon.
And if you were lucky enough to meet them, to touch them, to be touched by them, you came away a better person.
If you'll excuse me.
Is he... is he talking about you guys?
Yes. Yes, he is, uh... he's talking about us.
We are, unfortunately, we're going away... tomorrow.
So, uh, we better make tonight count, huh, ladies?
Wait.
We barely got to know you!
How long will you be gone?
For... for... 44 weeks.
44 weeks?
Tell them about our business, man.
You don't have to be shy about it.
Uh, right.
No. Yeah.
Hello. Do you like socks?
We sell socks.
Everybody likes socks.
I just cried on my penis while I was peeing.
Whoa.
Schmidt: That happened.
I just can't stop thinking about them.
(sighs)
You know, there are some people that are gonna say that they... they look alike.
That they're exactly the same. And you know what?
They just don't know them like I know them.
Truth-truth be told?
One of them...
One of them is slightly more brown than the other.
And they're so unique, and they're so special.
You know what I'm gonna miss most about them?
Watching them bounce.
Watching them...
Watching them bounce.
If you just give me a chance to exp...
Well, easy come, easy go.
Easy? Easy?!
You just stole six months of my life, man.
I am... I am P.O.'d, hombre!
Winston!
Can I get a high five?
Bam.
(laughs)
Sorry I called you a biscuit.
I'm sorry I liked it so much. (laughs)
(knocking) NICK: Hey, Jess, you in there?
Is that Nick?
Do you mean Gay Nick?
Yeah, that's Gay Nick.
I am so sorry.
What's going on?
I screwed up. (door opens)
A girl, Nick?
I know.
Nick, really?
(laughs): Hey.
(laughs)
You look like my d*ad friend Karen.
Does anyone ever tell you that?
Hmm, no.
Thank you.
Mm.
(door closes) What?!
I wanted to be gay for you, I really did, but it's a very hard time to be gay.
Girls are wearing scarves and boots.
They have so many layers to them.
What is underneath all those layers? I want to find out!
Are you blaming autumn?
Look, it was one night. Get rid of her!
I tried. I told her I live with my ex, and she didn't care.
You look so cute in the morning. (laughs)
You talking to me or her? (laughter)
(door closes) Okay. I'll get rid of her.
I'll just pretend to be your crazy ex-girlfriend.
I can do this. I did a one-woman production of A Christmas Carol.
(British accent): You, sir, what day is it?
Aye, it's Christmas day.
That was not good.
It was perfect.
Thank you. I thought you'd think that.
Yeah, it's perfect.
All right, look, you stay here and keep your gay warm, okay?
In case Ian comes back. Also, can we agree that this is not the most mature way to handle things?
Even though it's pretty fun.
It's no fun a couple Bellinis and a round of apples to apples can't solve.
What kind of gay are you?
I'm still finding it.
All right.
All right.
Nick thinks we're broken up, but he also thinks that the last girl he slept with wasn't me in a wig.
(laughs)
Wigs are so good for tricking guys.
I'm around all the time.
Do you really want to get yourself in this situation?
My last boyfriend was, like, honestly in his 80s.
I was just like, "Don't die, Myron."
Does that answer your question?
Tell me everything you did sexually!
Everything! All of it, or leave!
I put my finger...
Stop!
But you asked...
No.
I-I did, but it backfired.
Winston: Ah, so it is load bearing, huh?
What are you doing?
Me? Oh, well, first, I'm putting up the shelves.
Then I got to finish the floor, so that the shelves can appear level, then the ceiling.
Enough! All right? You've done enough for these women.
Look, ladies, I tried to manipulate you, and I am sorry about that, but you guys have been manipulating my friend for months.
It is not okay. Just dangling sex like a little carrot.
We are not using sex to get Winston to do stuff.
No.
Wait. You're not?
No.
Well, then he's done doing stuff.
Come on, Winston. You're better than this.
Forget you guys.
Wait!
Yeah, just-just give us a minute.
Okay, we have to talk about...
Okay.
What are they whispering about?
I don't know.
We could just stack the books.
No... No.
Oh, man, this is embarrassing.
Uh...
Okay. It's me.
Come on.
What?
Wait. Listen. Um...
Michelle, you don't have to do this.
That's okay. I kind of want to.
Just, uh, keep the pencil behind your ear, and bring the hard hat, um, and the safety goggles.
(whispers): Long game.
(sighs)
Wonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.
Well, you know women.
What's women?
(laughs)
(laughs): Am I right?
"What's women?"
I just don't know them like you know them, is my point.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so, what kind of guys do you like to date?
Me? All kinds.
Yeah.
Hunks. If I can get my, uh, paws on a hunk, I don't let go.
Uh, ripped nerds.
'Cause they're smart but strong, I guess.
Uh-huh.
I like Spanish guys.
Throw in a little, uh, hint of German in there, there's a perfect combo.
Okay.
Certain ice cream men, I guess.
Carpet steamers. Sleepy guys.
Uh, we in the gay community call them "drowsers."
Why would you like a sleepy guy?
Look... I'm so out of the game...
I'm in a relationship.
Um... he's got a nice penis.
You're sweating a lot.
That's what he said! Am I right?
(laughs)
I'm a sweaty lover, is what he says to me.
Okay, you know, you really don't seem gay.
I don't buy it.
Hey. Not now.
Probably wondering why I didn't come home last night.
Just needed some space to process this whole thing.
I'm sorry if our room felt empty.
(sighs)
Well, it did.
I was really worried about you.
So where were you? You owe me that much.
I just went walking on the streets last night.
I needed to come to terms with all this.
Ended up in a park. I know that's stupid, but I promise I was careful.
I mean, I was totally safe.
A park?
I don't know, man.
Hey, I'm upset... but I understand.
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
(sighs) There, there.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Acceptance. Wow.
Yeah.
Give me a kiss.
Just give me a kiss.
All right?
I felt like you needed that more than I did.
(sighs)
You're scruff, by the way, is perfect.
Don't touch your beard trimming setting.
Okay.
Take it easy.
Okay.
That was beautiful.
I'm-I'm sorry, you know?
I think I'm just more used to, like, stereotypical gay guys, like him, you know?
You offended me.
I'm sorry.
Ian! Ian! Hi. There are some events that are about to occur that I'd like to get ahead of.
Um, the truth is that Nick is...
Oh, God.
Get off of me!
You're not a man!
Ian! Wait. I'm so sorry I lied, and you don't owe me anything, but could I just ask you one thing before you leave?
What is this, an exit interview?
Is there any good way I could have told you about my living situation?
Okay, you know what? Fair question. Um... no!
Look, Nick was just trying to help me. Clearly, he would do anything for you. I mean, he went so far as to hire an actual gay man to play his cheating lover.
What? Oh, my God. You know what?
I think that was Schmidt.
He's... not gay.
When are the lies gonna stop?!
Now, this is just a consultation, so do your best to relax.
Okay.
Stop the surgery!
This is just a consultation.
May we have the room, please?
That's what it's here for.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?!
Okay, look, I know I can't stop this, and I accept that, but I just wanted to stop it long enough so that I could say good-bye.
Aw. Look, this is a low-risk procedure, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, you meant say good-bye to my boobs.
I forgot who I was talking to.
No, Schmidt, you cannot see my boobs.
I need to look them in the eyes. I can't let them leave without knowing how much they've meant to me.
I'll let them know.
No.
I need to tell them myself.
(groans) All right... you can say good-bye to one, all right?
I mean, j-just one?
One.
(sighs) Gosh almighty.
The Ultimate Sophie's Cho-Cho.
I mean, there's Harold, who's just... full of life...
(groans)
(sighs) And Kumar, who's shy.
Who's shy, but yet surprisingly so brave.
But, you know, who wouldn't be with a best friend like Harold?
Oh, my God, fine!
You can say good-bye to both, okay?
Okay. I need you to put these on.
What?
This is a private conversation that doesn't concern you.
The playlist... matches the mood.
("Canon in D" playing)
(music fades)
I mean, I guess if I'm being honest, it doesn't matter what size you are. I'm always gonna love you, because you're attached to the most beautiful person in the whole world.
(music resumes)
You know what I think? I think that when people go on dates with us, probably talk to their friends and their friends say, "You go on dates with a lot of weirdos."
(shower running)
Oh, my God. We're the weirdo ass clowns.
Aw, no. Everyone in their 30s waits in line for the shower.
I'm sorry, but the truth is, as long as you live with me, you're not gonna meet a normal guy.
(Jess chuckles)
Why are you guys all in here?
Winston's taking a long-ass shower.
Poor guy gets dirty.
All right, let me see the new.
I accept it.
Again, it was just a consultation. And actually, I don't even know if I'm gonna go through with it.
You're still here. I saved you.
I'm your Schindler. One day, your children are gonna put rocks on my grave.
Hey, uh, wow. You guys mind if I get cuts? 'Cause I am very dirty.
Wait a minute.
Who's in the sh...
Hey, what's the vibe here on shower pee-pee?
I'm just trying to plan my day.
Who is this woman?!
You have awesome water pressure. You should see what's falling out of my hair.
Well, Nick... looks like you're gonna have to marry her.
It's looking that way, isn't it?
Yeah.
She's not so bad.
She's peeing in the shower.
Yeah, she is.
(laughs) That's weird.
Classic Tina.
Cece went on a date last night?
Schmidt, why don't you just read my text messages while I'm in the shower like you normally do?
Our Cece has taken a lover? Good for him.
Don't get weird, Schmidt.
I'm not being weird.
I just said good for him.
You know, I've camped in that forest, too The babbling brook, the beautiful mountains, little secret trailway that's only open seasonally, and when it is, let me tell you something, bring a camera.
Cool, not weird at all.
Good, you're all here.
I just got a tip from my buddy Dugan.
My academy background check is today and I need everybody's help.
Can't do it, bro.
Going to the outlet mall today. I'm gonna look like a rich person from three years ago.
Can't... You can't go to the outlet mall today. Not today.
Yeah, you can't go to the outlet mall today.
Why?
It's a weekend... what are you, crazy? Unless you got a game plan.
I have a game plan.
Schmidt: Grab a quick smoothie, power up.
Do my leg stores first. Pants, socks, shoes.
Hats and accessories last, then one sweet treat for the road. Most likely a cinnamon pretzel.
I'm in. (laughs)
That sounds like a tight afternoon.
I'm in for sure.
What the hell, dude?
I do want to be part of the pretzel.
This is my life. If I don't pass the background check, then I fail out of the police academy.
Guys, this is an all-hands-on-deck situation.
If we don't help him, Winston will never become a cop. Remember?
He-He handcuffed his cat's paw to a radiator and then lost the key.
In my defense, I was making a Christmas card, so...
Okay, you know what... I'm gonna cancel my plans with Cece.
I'll find out about her date with Paul later.
A ridiculous name. Oh, hey, my name is Puh-ha... Pau... I don't even know how to pronounce that.
It's Paul.
I'll take that Paul, I'll take him to a water park, I will.
I'll put him on one of those waterslides between two obese people and he'll get smushed to death.
Die in a... Die in a water... He'll die between the obese people before he drowns in the water.
What?
Hmm?
Schmidt, that is exactly the kind of talk we can't have today when the LAPD comes here.
Um... the, uh, cops are coming here?
Yes.
Like, here, here?
Yes.
Like, to our home, w-where we keep our stuff?
Why can't we just go there? We'll just go there, a-answer some questions, get an ice coffee on the way back... I really feel like ice coffee.
It's a home visit, Jess.
And not just from any cop. It's from Sergeant Tess Dorado. The Fish.
I'm pretty sure they call her The Fish because she's tough but fair, just like most fish I've interacted with.
Winston, "Dorado" is a fish.
It's a subset of mahi-mahi and it pairs very nicely with citrus, you oaf.
I'm not a oaf, you're a oaf, stupid.
So... You're dumb. Shut up.
Also, put on some underpants, please. It's like a bounce house down there.
Do you guys think that the cops are gonna go through our stuff?
What are you afraid of? They'll look through your dream journal?
No, I just...
What, are you running a sweatshop back there for skirts that look like curtains?
Actually...
What'd you- What'd you, steal a kiss and hide it in an envelope?
(all laugh)
I have a bag of meth in my closet.
Oh, I know it's in here somewhere...
Oh, oh, ooh. These are my "bad decision" hats.
Bad decision, right?
How do you not know where a bag of meth is?
Find it and get rid of it.
Find it, get rid of it.
Jess, why do you have meth in your closet?
Do you remember that day when I was trying to convince you guys to come with me to that waffle restaurant in the Antelope Valley that I found?
And you were like, "That's way too far to go for waffles."
Turns out you were right... How good can a waffle really be?
That's the question I answered that...
Tell us the story faster.
Your waffle story sucks.
Where is the bag of crystal methamphetamine, you dummy?
Okay, fine. Do you see that footstool?
I bought it at a garage sale.
Turns out the top opens up and when I opened up the top, I found... here it is... this.
Coach: Holy frickin' what?
(whoops)
Aah!
Oh, hey. How do I look?
Terrible.
N- Not for me.
Not great.
Like crap.
Go change.
I don't like any of it.
Wow. You guys are like rubbing alcohol.
You sting me in the now, but save me in the later.
All right.
Okay, Winston cannot find out about this.
Because if he doesn't know, he can't get in trouble, and he's probably already failing out of the academy as it is.
Also, why are you keeping this in your closet?
What am I supposed to do, notify the authorities? I'm sorry, Officer, I found this bag of meth in a footstool I bought at a garage sale. Uh, no.
My closet is safe. The only person who goes in there is me when I'm naked and/or sad.
Hey. Much better, right?
I found it on the lawn.
(chuckles)
And that's the whole story.
So, you guys ready? She's on her way.
Why don't you go wait for her downstairs?
Don't make her buzz up like a shawarma boy.
Good idea, good idea.
This way, I get to tell her my sidewalk joke.
You remember the sidewalk joke, right?
There's a man on the s...
How's it...? There's a man on the...
Oh, you know, okay...
Everybody just calm down.
Especially you, Nick, you're already sopping wet.
Lying makes me sweat. I can't lie.
It's why I don't play poker or talk to pregnant ladies.
No one has to lie. I'm just going to get rid of it.
(mutters anxiously)
I'm gonna call Cece.
She knows about this stuff.
She lived one summer in Milan with a guy named Crystal Randy.
Ask her about the date.
Hey, Cece, quick question. How does one get rid of a bag of meth? Call me back.
Ask her if Paul is taller than me.
Stop it.
Did she surrender her virtue?
Hey.
Throw it in the trash.
I can't see it.
I can't see where it goes, 'cause then when she comes in here, I'll just yell "trash!" I'll yell "trash!"
Cover your ears and sing "Landslide."
Schmidt: Let's call Cece again.
# Took my love and I took it down d... #
We need to get this back in my closet...
I could see your lips moving.
Well, close your eyes.
(Nick singing)
Throw it out the window, okay?
I'll sneak down there, I'll toss it in the Dumpster. Here.
Oh!
Jess: Oh, my God!
What the heck, Jess?
Jess: I threw like a boy!
I've always thrown like a boy!
You almost h*t me in the face!
What are you, nuts?
Overhand?
Oh, well, Winston's a goner.
You know, this building used to be a biscuit factory.
And apparently, the mice have not been told it's gone residential.
Was that a joke?
I hate jokes.
# ...of changing #
Jess: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
# 'Cause I built We just have to hide this. #
# My whole life around you Throw it in here. #
Come on!
I was bringing it to you!
Why does everybody keep asking me to throw stuff?
Schmidt: Work on your aim!
This is actually a really good song.
Nick, stop singing!
Where are we gonna put this?
Put it in the baggie!
Fun Saturday?
No. My bird d*ed.
Well, my mom used to say when a bird dies, he gets another set of wings in heaven, so...
Well, that bird was going straight to hell.
Welcome to our home.
I will ask you questions. You will ask me no questions.
In pursuit of that, I will offer up three personal facts: I was born in St. Louis, I have three brothers, two of whom were k*lled in separate plane crashes, and...
I like music.
Good? Good.
Now, let's get started...
My name is Nick.
Nicholas Miller?
I- I don't... I don't know.
Schmidt: Hah!
He's just messing around with you.
He's our resident clown here.
Dorado: Let's keep this simple.
I need to be home in time to feed my bird.
Oh, God.
(light clattering)
Uh, green grape? Would you like...?
No, thanks.
I already had my grapes.
Jess!
I got your message.
Where's the freaking me...
Play along, or Jess goes to jail.
What are you doing?
Hey.
Look, it's my girlfriend Cece.
What's up, Cece?
Ah, it's his girlfriend Cece.
Winston: Girlfriend? Oh, my goodness, you guys are back together?
Yeah.
No, uh...
Like I always say, you can't put peanut butter and jelly on the same shelf and expect 'em not to mix.
'Cause somebody got to eat a sandwich.
It's exciting.
Yeah, no.
Moving on. Miss Day, in your own words, please state why Cadet Bishop would be an asset to the Los Angeles Police Department.
A few kind words. Known me for a long time.
Yeah.
It's your boy Winnie the Bish.
Oh!
(light clattering)
I have to go to the bathroom.
Winston: If you guys will excuse me for just one second.
Okay.
Will somebody answer the question so I can write it on the form and we can get on with our lives?
Why would Bishop make a good police officer?
Mustache.
I'm sorry?
Because, uh, Winston has a mustache.
And, uh, police officers all have mustaches.
No, they don't. Not the ladies.
Unless the ladies want to.
Why can't a lady have a mustache?
She can. And it would look sexy.
Would you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth? Handed to your mouth?
I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.
No, he- he would. He definitely would.
Yeah, he would.
You know, Winston has done plenty for, uh, the, um... community.
He has a little brother at the Boys & Girls Club.
Of course. All the work that Winston does with the Boys & Girls Club that he actually does in real life.
So much work at the Boys & Girls Club.
Yeah. So passionate.
What was his little brother's name again?
Duke.
Juan.
Duquan is his name.
Duquan.
Duquan. Duquan.
And I'm Nick Miller.
Hey, let me ask you s... um...
Hmm?
Breasts.
It's my cycle.
Already?
Damn, girl. My calendar is way off on you.
You must be, what, like, ten days early?
Aw, Winston. Someday you're gonna make some lucky girl really uncomfortable. Can you go get Cece and tell her to meet me in the bathroom?
Sure. And, girl, uh, you ain't got a cycle... you got a roller coaster.
(chuckles) Don't I know it, girl?
Mm-hmm.
(growls, chuckles)
Duquan Feldman?
I'm gonna make a note to call the Boys & Girls Club.
No!
Why not?
Uh, because he's coming here.
Why would... why would Duquan come- come here?
Because he comes here every Saturday.
He does?
Then where is he?
Huh?
It's Saturday. Where is he?
He's at the bus station. He's waiting for, uh, one of us to get him, and, uh...
You know what? I'll go do it. You guys stay put.
You're gonna go and get Duquan?
I think so.
Yeah.
You guys, anybody want to... come... with? No?
(sighs) Where are you, Duquan?
Hey. Cece, Jess needs some help with some lady stuff.
Of course.
You know how we do.
(chuckles)
Schmidt: Whoof...
Gonna...
Must be a rough one.
You know what, I'm gonna have a look around.
What a great i... You know what, you should start with Nick and I's room. We share it.
Hey, don't mind the condoms. We've been banging like rabbits.
Not each other.
What are you doing? Jessica.
No, Jessica! What are you doing? You do not put drugs down the shower drain. Have you never seen a drug movie before?
I don't know. I saw <i>Ray.</i>
That does not count.
I might have ruined Winston's chances of being a cop.
Well, we can cry about that later. We are gonna take the drugs now and we're gonna go flush 'em, all right?
What are you doing? Come on. Help me. Pick up the drugs, Jess.
I think that the meth entered my bloodstream through my boob skin.
That is not a thing.
That's not how drugs work.
I'm the one on meth! Don't tell me how drugs work!
Okay.
(toilet gurgling)
Oh, my God.
(exhaling anxiously)
Could you open this trunk?
Oh, I'll do more than open it.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm gonna open the trunk.
(whispers): I think I'm having a heart att*ck.
What are you... Oh, my God.
You're a mess. Here. Cover up. Cover...
No, I'm not putting that... I'm not putting on your kimono. It legitimizes you owning it.
Just put it on. Put it on.
Okay.
I'm wearing a kimono.
I see that. Why?
Why? Why is he still wearing pants? That's the real question.
(creaking, clanging)
What's all that going on out there?
I'm on drugs. I'm on drugs...
What's all that clanging?
Uh, just a bunch of clanging.
Well, there's feminine issues...
It's probably the ladies playing with their jewelry.
Their brooches.
You know how... Brooches. Of course.
Nick makes a very good point.
I'm gonna go check on that right now, actually.
Uh, Winston, why don't you show the good sergeant Jess' room?
What?
What a great idea.
Oh, I've had intercourse in there.
You'll be excited to...
I think I'm gonna take off, too.
Nick, what is going on out there?
What's going on out there?
No, I'm asking you what's going on.
Hmm?
What's going on?
(grunting quietly)
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, what happened to the "turlet"?
Schmidt, you're here. So we're in a little bit of a thing right now, but you're our best cleaner.
We might be out of towels, but you'll figure out something.
Right? It's gonna be fun.
Jess, are you crying right now?
I don't know.
I hadn't noticed. Um... (sniffles)
I might be on drugs.
You gonna help mop or are you just gonna try to kiss me again?
Oh, please.
You kissed me back. Your... I felt your lips surrender. And who's this Paul anyway? Paul.
What, does he work in a pizzeria?
Yes, Schmidt, I went on a date with a guy named Paul.
You just need to get over it.
Paul. Paul. Nice name, dude.
Why is your shirt off?
I've seen <i>New Jack City</i>, okay?
They all take their shirts off in the cr*ck cocaine lab!
Ah, it won't go down!
Hats off to the hillbilly that made this meth.
Meth?
What meth?
This meth.
It's... legal meth.
It's... medical meth.
For my... cramps.
Wait a minute. Who's with Nick? d I took my love and I took it down d d I drove around and I h*t a pound d d And I saw all the puppies with their d d Eyes so blind...
Nick! Nick!
Sergeant Dorado, don't listen to him! He's deranged!
I'm gonna talk to this man alone.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That is not good.
No.
So, this Paul...
I've never seen someone sweat so much in my life. It looks like your body is crying.
What are you hiding?
Distraction!
Okay. You're a tough cookie.
And that's the last thing I'll say.
Look...
Okay, you want the truth? I'll tell you everything.
When I was 13 years old, I once made love to myself behind a post office.
Oh.
Hey!
(honks horn)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Yo! What's up? You in the shorts.
Hey, come here, man. Come here. I need a little boy.
(chuckles) Whoa. No. That's not what I meant. No, no, no.
I didn't mean... You know what I'm... Ah.
I wasn't trying to...
It's for my friend, you know?
I need you to come over to, uh, hang out with my friends.
No, not like that. I just need you to pretend like, uh, you're in a relationship with this grown man that I know. Ah! Ah! Uh, I did not think this through. Did not think this through.
Um, bad decision. Very bad decision.
I'm gonna go now. Don't remember my face.
Forget this face. This didn't happen.
What is wrong with the name Paul, okay?
Paul is a normal name. He is a normal guy.
That <i>is</i> the problem, okay?
You shouldn't be with a normal guy.
All right, okay.
It was Mark-Paul Gosselaar.
What? You... you were... you were with Zack Morris?
Mm-hmm.
Guy's a frigging god.
I mean, all right. I've... I surrender.
That's awes... Can I come to the wedding?
(laughs) You think Slater and Screech are gonna be there?
(laughing): I'm kidding. I just wanted to freak you out.
You really had me going there for a second.
(laughing) It works every time with you.
It's amazing. Now...
There was a real second there where I had bad feelings towards Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and I didn't like any moment of that.
How dare you. Don't ever do that to me again.
When I was nine years old, I fed cereal flakes to a frog, and it d*ed.
Then I went into a period of time where I fed cereal flakes to all little animals.
Squirrels can live through it, chipmunks can live through it.
Anything that lives half in and out of water dies, and I don't understand why.
When I was ten, I once walked by my mother sleeping, and I snuck in the room, and I put a lemon in her mouth.
When I was 11, I once tried on my girl cousin's wool tights, and I didn't hate the way it felt!
Why are you telling me this?
Because you said you wanted to hear everything!
My sixteenth year, I never got an erection.
I thought they were done.
I thought my penis was d*ad.
It wasn't.
It's fine, Winston. We can fix this.
Just help me mule this crank.
I'll prepare, you mule.
I can't mule crank. I don't have the system.
It's the perfect plan. I don't think it is.
Jess, do you know how much time we could get for possessing this much meth? Why'd you hide it from me?
I was trying to protect you.
I should've been the first person you told!
I could've taken care of it, or something.
Now it just looks like we're hiding it.
I just...
I didn't... I didn't think there was anything you could do.
And- and why is that?
Because... I don't know!
Because you don't see me as a cop. None of you do.
I didn't... I didn't think you'd make it this far.
We always thought you'd change your mind.
I mean... you say a prayer every time you get on a escalator.
Why risk it?
I just... never really saw you as a... as a cop.
Sorry.
Oh, there it is.
Okay. Okay.
You know what? I know exactly what I have to do.
I'm gonna tell her it's mine.
What?! No. No.
Yes. Maybe I'm not supposed to be a cop.
There's no reason you should lose your job, too.
I once changed a sign that said "Happy Jewish New Year" to "Happy Newish Jew Year."
Is that a hate crime? Stop talking, stop sweating.
What is wrong with you people?! Enough!
Sarge, I have something I need to tell you.
Wait! Sergeant!
My name is Jessica Day, and this is my meth.
Dorado: What?!
Jess, No. I won't accept that. So...
The bathroom is covered in meth.
Meth that belongs to me.
And it may have intoxicated me through the skin on my breasts.
But I assure you, no one here had any prior knowledge of any of this.
Especially Winston.
And I don't want him to go down for my mistake.
You'd be lucky to have him as a cop.
Take me downtown to the all-lady fur factory.
Okay, cuff me.
Somebody bring me handcuffs. I'm guilty.
Is she cuffing me?
I can't see what's going on up there.
Do you feel anything?
Does meth make you feel, like, normal, but, like... like your face feels, like, scratchy?
Oh, no, that's just the carpet on my face.
Here's the way this is gonna go down.
I'm gonna go in the bathroom, have a look around.
You will stay here.
You will not move, you will not talk, you will not think unless they're thoughts about not moving.
Winston, I'm so sorry.
I ruined everything.
You would have been such a good cop.
You would have made someone really lucky to have you as a partner.
I always imagined I'd have a partner named Robertson.
That would have been perfect.
Yeah.
"Robertson, you're on the edge!
You've gone too far!"
No, no, no.
See, the thing about me and Robertson is that we're tight.
You know, then I went ahead and slept with his wife.
I don't know why...
Why would you do that?
I don't know why I would do that. The job really gets to you.
You know, it's stressful out there.
This might not be the right moment but... for what it's worth, I did it.
I kept a secret.
Well, congratulations, Nick.
You have the willpower of a six-year-old.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry about the whole kissing thing.
Oh, you don't have to apologize.
I did... kiss you back a little.
So, should we tell Paul together?
Oh.
Well, what do you think he's doing right now?
Do you think he's explaining to the air-brusher that that really is his name? Paul?
And that he wants that painted across the back of his denim jacket?
It's a normal name.
(whispering): Hey, Nick?
When I'm in prison, write, dance, sing... live your life.
And if you come and visit me in jail, please don't wear that robe.
It's a kimono.
Well, this is a first.
These are aquarium rocks.
So, that's the street name for...
No. These are actual aquarium rocks.
You were trying to flush rocks down your toilet.
Oh, what?!
Oh.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
That's great! Yes! Awesome!
So we're not going to prison?
(Cece laughing)
So, did Winston pass the background check?
Of course. He's one of our best cadets.
His test scores are high, he's passionate, hardworking.
He's gonna make one hell of a cop.
But he won't work in narcotics.
You get to be a cop!
Yay!
(all chatting happily)
Congrat... congrat... Congratulate...
Really? No, we're celebrating Winston.
Celebrating Winston. Okay.
All right, we'll celebrate Winston.
Oh.
Yeah.
Excuse me. Please consider moving.
I have no idea why you live with these people.
What kind of person would urinate on an electrical socket?
I... I thought it would make lightning.
I told you that wouldn't work, Nick.
Coach: Hey!
Guess who's here like he normally is every Saturday!
It's Duquan!
Big brother Wimstons.
Oh.
I love you, Mr. Wimstons.
I go from no hope to hope.
He take me and he says to me, "You're gonna be somebody. You- You could be the presidents, or Statues of Liberties."
Is that right?
We make homework togethers.
He buys me toys, and we chase each others, and we laugh at the sun.
This feels good, man.
Yeah.
Like I got a new friend.
Me, too.
Duquan.
Right.
Hanging out.
It's Jose, so...
Yeah, I like Duquan, though.
Yeah, but my name's Jose.
Like outlet malls?
I love outlet malls.
Ah, me, too, man.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's awesome.
On the weekend, though? Mm.
Yeah, but I mean, I have a strategy, you know.
Like, I start out with a smoothie, and then do my leg stores first.
Then, I... Yeah.
I do the same, but I end it with pretzel.
Pretzel. I...
Shut up.
Cinnamon pretzel?
Oh, my God.
Dude, don't, don't,.
No, you don't.
Don't.
No, you don't.
You want to play a tickle game?
(Phone rings)
Hello?
Hello, "Dog," it's Principal Foster.
Oh, hey. Did you just call me "Dog"?
You're Vice Principal now. We're peers.
Oh.
Good news... I have a replacement for your science class.
It's about time, you old son of a bitch.
What?!
Too casual?
Uh, what?
Hello?
Sorry, what? You're breaking up.
Hello?
Dog?
Hello? Sorry, hello?
(Staticky): I can't hear you.
Bad reception, sorry. Hold on.
(Staticky): Breaking up...
I'm so sorry. They're building a new building next door and I have terrible reception.
Hey, no more phone calls! Get out of my room!
It's the only place I can get a signal, dude...
You know that.
Out!
Look at the stick... Is it red or blue?
Uh, yeah...
Well, sir, I...
Get out of my room.
Hello? Hello? Hello  Hello? Hello... Stop.
Is it red or blue?
Hey, ow, Schmidt!
The Scarf has been backordered a month.
Wait, hello?
Meanwhile the hat is just sitting here.
Yeah, hello.
This is not a business center.
Hello?
Get out of my room.
Hello? Hello?
It's my man time.
Mama?
Mama, unplug it, okay?
Schmidt: Hello? Hello.
If you unplug it, it cannot electrocute you.
It's blue? Oh, yes!
Mr. Foster...
No, I don't want blue. With a bisque hat?
Hello, Dog. Dog?
I'll look insane!
Why do you have an electric guitar?
Aah!
Hello?
This phone situation has me really jazzed up!
Excuse my language.
Now, I'm gonna propose something.
Something insane.
Now you just all have to stay calm and trust me.
Fascinating.
Where do you put your music?
Why is there a rope?
(Phone rings)
(Gasps) It's ringing.
Whoa, that's cool.
Just like the movies.
We should answer it with, like, really funny voices.
Yeah.
We don't know who it is.
It could be anybody.
Could be Tanya from sixth grade.
Yeah.
(Stops ringing)
Oh... oh.
Next time it rings, we should answer it.

Just can't stop looking at this thing.
Man, I used to be so great at talking on the phone, man.
You know, something about the cord and the handset that just really set me at ease.
You were weirdly smooth.
If you slow dance with Nick, I'll hold hands with Amy.
Just make sure she cut her fingernails, though.
Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.
I'm just being stupid.
Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.
It was going great, by the way.
If this isn't sexy, I don't know what the heck is.
Something just came over him.
He was amazing.
I'm just excited to add a third number:
Home, work and cell.
Damn, I'm reachable.
I'm definitely gonna mention that in my profile in Business, Man! Magazine.
Businessman Magazine?
No, no, no.
Check that out:  Business, Man! Magazine.
I've gotten a lot of heat from working on the sponge account.
I'm telling you, this is the first step in my quest to becoming a millionaire.
Well, I think that's a weird plan, but let's drink to it... Who's in?
No, come on, I got to study for my interview.
Oh, I would, man, but I got a lot of police stuff to study.
You know, like, roads, laws, b*ll*ts...
Be really nice if you guys spent some time and studied your friend Nick. Pop quiz, hotshots.
I miss you guys.
I don't understand what you're saying, man. Are you asking me a question?
For real, though, I miss you.
So we would just sit around and drink all day?
Aw, forget it, man! I'm storming off.
(Phone rings)
Oh!
Good morning, Vice Principal Day speaking.
What...? Calm down!
What?! Coach?!
(Whispering): Coach...
Are you sleeping with the school nurse?
Jess, are you crazy?
Of course I'm sleeping with the school nurse.
What?
Mazel tov.
My man. Much respect.
Look at you getting up in there.
Yeah. Living the dream.
Great.
That's really hot, dude.
That's really great. For me.
We have to fill out a form declaring our relationship?
Yes, it's a legal thing.
We're just covering our asses.
While you uncover yours.
Sorry, that was an unfortunate joke.
(Nervous laugh)
Um, anyway, uh, how did this start?
Uh, fine. A couple of weeks ago I got a cut.
Mm-hmm.
And I went to the nurse.
Okay.
And when I saw her, I was like, "damn."
And I was, like, "you frickin' got a cut."
And I was like, "you frickin' better fix it."
And she was like, "no. Cuts are gross."
Yeah.
And then we had sex.
Yeah.
That's disturbing on so many levels.
Um, I'm sorry, but your outfit looks like you got it at a Halloween store.
Thank you. Coach got it for me.
It's a child's medium.
(Giggles)
What'd you put for "nature of relationship"... "Girlfriend"?
Well, that's what I actually wanted to talk to you about.
'Cause, uh, we hadn't...
Question mark?
Um, it didn't feel like a question mark when you put a calamari on my finger like an engagement ring.
That didn't seem like a question mark to you?
Jess, someone's in my parking spot again.
Not now, Rose.
Hey, Ernie.
Hey.
Last night was really fun.
I found your swim trunks.
They're ruined. Really fun.
Ah, come on. Yeah?
I thought you ditched this bitch.
I will send your weave right back to the loom!
Oh, no, no. Excuse me?
Guys...
Oh, yeah!
Ladies, stop.
(Both arguing at once)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
See what you did?
This is a different form.
(Phone ringing)
(Groans)
All right.
(Ringing continues)
Settle down, I'm coming.
Hello?
No, Schmidt's not here.
No one's here. I'm here by myself.
Because I work at night, which means I'm probably the one who should answer the phone during the day.
Great, yeah, I'll tell him.
(Groans, sighs)
Great, she get a phone so Nick can answer it.
(Phone rings)
(Sighs)
(Groans)
What? I'm busy.
Winston's not here.
Really?
Uh-huh. Okay, I'll pass it on.
Okay, you too.
My gentlemen, I'm glad you're home.
I got your messages.
All right, here you go.
Wow. Are these alphabetized?
Yeah, you're welcome.
I felt like a secretary. It was pretty awesome.
Some auto body shop called, Schmidt... Apparently you're getting a spoiler?
I'm not getting a sp...
I just wanted a quote. Yeah, I get a quote just in case I do want to actually buy one.
And it's nice to have a price before you get emotionally invested. It's called predicting desires.
What I wish I would have said is when I first said it...
"Spoiler alert."
I wish it... when I... I wish I would have said, um,
"you're getting a spoiler.
Spoiler alert."
I don't think that would have helped.
I just... I'm just getting a quote, okay? It's really none of your business.
Definitely noted. Thanks, my man.
For the... Winston, uh...
Who's this Gal Judy?
I've never heard of her. She called twice.
Who is this woman?
(Chuckles) She's nobody.
Doesn't sound like nobody. Where'd you guys meet?
At the driving range.
The driving range?
But you don't golf.
Uh, I like to watch?
Winston, you go to the driving range just to watch?
Yeah.
Very strange, very strange.
Let's get back to this Judy character, because I am interested.
You made love to her yet?
I don't know.
Leave me alone, dude. Honestly, stop.
That's not even a big d... I don't even like her that much, all right?
Just, ugh. I'm probably gonna dump her.
Do you want to talk about it?
Just kidding. I'm messing with you.
Are you guys having as much fun as I'm having right now?
This landline has really brought us together in a great way.
I miss this.
Hey, if I cooked up a whole chicken, would you guys have some?
Those look like two hungry faces... (Chuckles)
Wow. That was intrusive.
Winston, how do you not know if you'd made love to someone?
I'm mad at you, Jess.
Why'd you put me on blast like that?
Because you shouldn't be sleeping with other teachers, Coach, let alone two.
Who are you, Blanche from Golden Girls?
Honestly, it took me a while to figure out who I was in that school, but I finally did.
Who?
I'm the guy who has sex with everyone.
Why can't you be the guy who loves recycling?!
Everyone loves that guy. This is a school.
It's a sexy place, Jess.
Look at that CPR poster. It's hot as crap.
What the...?
Why aren't they wearing shirts? Are they drinking wine?
Mm... That's it!
I'm gonna need to talk to all these teachers.
You're just jealous because you're not gettin' any.
(Indignant gasp)
When's the last time someone gave you CPR?
Well, I give it to myself at least once a month...
Oh!
To refresh.
I'm talking about real CPR!
Oh.
Look, you work in a school.
You need to have boundaries.
You have to be a professional.
Ah, Miss Day.
Oh.
There's someone here I'd like you to meet.
Oh!
This is Ryan.
He's gonna be taking over the science class.
Now, don't be alarmed, but his voice is gonna sound kind of funny.
It's because he's British.
Say something to her.
Hello. Pleased to meet you.
Ah. Oh, charming. Hi.
It's a... How do you do?
You must be, um... Mister...
"Gos... Gosin-Yure."
It's pronounced "Goes-In-You."
Goes-In-Who?
It "goes in you," Jess.
Goes in me. Goes in... Jess. What!?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna make a note of how to pronounce it.
It's really nice to meet you, Mr. Goes-In...
Ryan.
Coach: Hey, Jess, where you going? You forgot to tell him about boundaries!
It's great having you here, Mr. Goes-In-You.
Geauxinue. Yeah. Goes-In-You, Goes-In-You.
No... goes in all of us.
Yeah.
Sooner or later.
(Phone buzzes) This is Schmidt.
Hey, it's Nick. Let me get Winston.
Winnie the bish, you on?
What is happening right now?
I'm just giving you guys your midday update.
Schmidt, dry-cleaner company called.
Your socks are ready.
Schmidt: Oh, great.
Not quite sure why we need to be on a conference call for this.
Not quite sure why you need to dry-clean your socks, you weirdo, but we'll get back to that.
Winston, Judy called again.
And so, I told her you weren't feeling it.
(Laughs) Now why would you do that?
You said you were gonna dump her.
It was a very difficult conversation for you.
We all know how you are, so I just handled it. You're welcome.
Hey, Nick, do I need to be on for this? Can I get off?
Greta, great, great. You know what? Now she's gonna do something crazy.
You know, this is a very emotional woman we're dealing with, all right?
That bitch a leo!
Can I go now?
You should have thought of that before you dumped her.
I didn't! You did!
Because that's what you wanted.
I don't know what I want!
Judy didn't know what you wanted, either!
Oh, and Schmidt, the magazine called.
And they need a picture. But don't worry. I handled it.
What do you mean, you handled it?
I know you have a lot on your plate, so don't worry...
I sent them the most recent picture I had.
The most recent one?
Winston: Did Judy sound...?
Winston, enough! Nick, what, what do you mean by "the most recent"? I don't... I don't understand what that...
The latest picture.
It's the most accurate.
It's just good marketing. You know that. Check your e-mail.
You'll be happy.
Did you check it? Is it loaded?
Oh, no, no, no!
And that's all I got. You guys good?
(Schmidt sighs)
Okay, I'll check back in five.
What? Five... Five what? Nick? Five minutes?!

Yo!
What up? What up? What up?
Winston!
Hello.
I said... Winston I said "yo."
Wait. Who's this?
It's Schmidt! We got to do something about Nick.
We're here to address the school policies on interfaculty relations.
Some forms of touching, say, a... a friendly handshake, or a spirited pat, are completely appropriate.
Man: What if you spill coffee on your pants, and you're very burnt, and upon getting your pants cut off by paramedics, you become aroused?
I'm truly hoping that didn't happen.
What if you're in a situation where you either have to um...
Grab a teacher's crotch, or give narcotics to a student?
That's a great question, man.
Thanks, friend.
Not a great question.
And what if you...?
I'm done with you. If you feel things getting sexual...
Just say, "shut it down!"
Followed by a sweeping gesture with your hands, like such.
Everyone do it with me. Shut it down!
No, thanks.
It's kind of fun. Shut it down.
Shut it... Down.
Thank... Thank you, new guy.
Yes, Coach.
See, I'm more of a visual learner.
(Laughing): Oh, yeah, you are.
Do you think you could maybe demonstrate that move in context?
Really, Coach?
I think we'd all like that.
It's kind of like a...
Like a skit.
What?! (Overlapping chatter)
No idea.
Visual learning.
Like a skit.
All: Visual learning.
Show us! Do it!
All: Visual learning!
Okay, Coach, do you want to come up and help me?
How about the new guy?
British people love doing stuff, right?
No, I don't think...
British guy... doing stuff!
Woman: Yeah.
British guy doing stuff!
I'm telling you they don't like to do things.
Doing stuff! (All chanting)
The British are coming!
Okay, okay.
Happy to help.
(Applause and cheering)
Mr... "Guzinya" and I will now act out a sexual scenario.
It's "Goes-In-You."
Yeah. I know.
Okay, let's try it again.
All right, all right.
(Beep) Hello. You've reached the loft.
Oh, my God!
What?
Too sexy!
Sounds good to me.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm on f*re right now.
This is a home. We're not selling lubricant.
Why aren't one of you doing this?
Because we couldn't decide which of us to do it, and this way, it's fair.
Put nothing on it. Flat as can be.
All right, here we go. Flat as can be.
Just say the words.
(Beep)
(Flatly): Hello. You've reached the loft.
Oh, my God!
Will you not stop until the whole world is aroused?!
Cece: Okay.
Hey.
Nick, my man, looking good.
There he is.
New set of PJs?
I know what you're doing.
You're bl*wing hot air up in between my butt cheeks.
And I'm no idiot. I know I was let go 'cause of the dang old machine. Story as old as time.
A new piece of technology comes around, and all the peasants freak out.
But one prince knows what's going on, and he says:"Don't trust the technology!"
And all you peasants trust it, and then the machine becomes self-aware and destroys you all.
And then, I become the loneliest prince of all, laughing in my golden tower.
(Laughs)
Isn't that a movie?
Maybe I stole that from w*r games, yeah.
Short Circuit.
No, it isn't.
Man, you know what's a good movie? Splash.
I don't know what is happening.
(Phone ringing)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let's see what she can do.
(Beep)
Cece (Flatly): Hello. You've reached the loft.
Schmidt: Oh, my God. Will you not stop until the whole world is aro...?
(Beep)
Woman: Hey, this message is for Nick.
You responded to my ad about a custom secretary headset.
Please give me a call back.
(Beep)
How do they know my name? It's a stinking old prank.
I don't even care.
I got a lot going on today, so...
Are you just eating a bowl of jelly?
What does it look like?
It looks like a bowl of jelly.
It's a bowl of jelly, yeah.
Okay, so say I'm in the library and I feel Mr. G.'S hands on my shoulders.
I'm not interested.
So what do I do?
I say, "shut it down."
Does that make things more clear for you?
I feel like it needs to be a little more real, you know what I mean?
I feel like if he were to touch her, that would help, am I right?
(Others agreeing)
Am I crazy for thinking that? No, right?
Yeah. Just...
It'll be more helpful if he were to touch her. Just touch her, man.
I don't think so.
Yeah, he should touch her. Touch her!
Get in there! Touch her.
Okay, fine. Um...
So I'm in the library and, uh, Ryan approaches...
Hello. You look tense.
(Oohing)
With that accent.
Oh!
(Everyone murmuring sensually)
Mmm...
Sha, na, na.
Mmm... Day-o.
A little lower. Right in the wolf patch.
(Puzzled murmuring) Huh? What?
Should I shut it down?
What? Yes. Yes!
Shut it down!
(All gasping)
I touched your... I... that was...
That's fine. It's-it's cool.
Nice to meet you, too. (Laughter)
That was an accident. And when an accident happens, shut it down.
(Cheering, laughter)
I did it again.
That's what I'm talking about!
I think we need to fill out some forms.
Why won't these messages play, Winston?
The machine's on the Fritz.
Just don't tell Nick.
The magazine was supposed to call today and set up my interview.
I'm as mad as a dad in traffic!
You probably burnt it out. I mean, you listened to Cece's message 100 times.
I know. Then I touched my peen.
(Scatting cheerily)
There he is.
All right, Nick, hey, uh, you were home today.
Did anybody leave any messages about my interview for tomorrow?
I don't know. Why don't you ask the machine? Isn't that what you wanted?
(Chuckles) Uh, the machine's not working.
Isn't that funny? I feel like I'm working perfectly.
I'm gonna go take this machine back to 1993 and exchange it.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
The magazine. They called.
They left a message. They want to do the interview today.
Why didn't you say anything?
That thing is super important to him.
You know how much this interview meant to him.
Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah.
First you break up with Judy and now this?
Why are you so obsessed with answering the phone?
Man.
We're just peeling the onion all the way to the middle, aren't we?
What's going on?
Just because I miss you guys.
And I didn't know what was going on with your lives and now I do, and it-it made me feel connected to you.
I'm not gonna lie to you, man, that got me.
(Phone rings)
Hello? This is Nick.
No, I'm sorry. Schmidt isn't here.
No, he didn't... Pl... H... Can you hold on one second?
(Quietly): It's the magazine.
They want to cancel the interview.
What?
They want to do it right now or not at all.
Yeah, this is Nick again. No, he-he did... He might...
Hold on one second. I hear something. That might be him. Please hold.
(Quietly): You've got to talk to 'em.
Why do I have to talk?
Because even though you're the most awkward person I've ever met, you're magic on the phone and you know it.
You know, I put those days behind me...
Schmidt's right here. Hold one sec.
(Quietly): You have to do it. For Schmidt.
I need a soda, I need a straw and I need to get horizontal, so get out of my way.
(Grunts)
(Exhales deeply)
Yeah, this is Schmidt. What up?
I read. The last book I read. Good question, good question.
Uh, some biography with, uh, Carson Daly. The one with the red cover.
Yes, that Carson Daly Joint.
You know, I respect that dude.
Yeah, he's just like me. He's always on.
There's not a lot of good white role models out there, and I say that as a white man.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you got it, Business, Man!
Is that the magazine? What are you boobs do...
What are you. Winston, get off the phone.
Stop, stop, stop. Stop.
Shh!
Trust us.
What does marketing mean to Schmidt?
This was the spoiler. What did it say? Uh...
Predicting desires.
Predicting desires.
Well, to me, it's all about predicting desires and finding buyers, you feel me? (Chuckles)
He's really good on the phone.
Did you know that my name was an acronym?
Uh-huh. Schmidt: Some can have money, I desire thoughtfulness.
(Winston laughs)
Schmidt don't quit!
Hey, Coach.
Hey.
I just came in here to say I'm sorry.
Sometimes it's...
Hard to control your feelings.
Which I demonstrated by...
Grabbing a man's "Dujeels" in front of the entire faculty.
Well, I'm sorry for putting you in a position to grab that man's "Dujeels."
I don't like saying "Dujeels." It's weird.
I call mine my Sam Jackson 'cause he's in everything.
I just don't know how to face Ryan again. I was so unprofessional.
Jess, you're the Vice Principal, and you're a great Vice Principal.
Doesn't mean you're not a human being.
Thanks.
Oh... And you'll be happy to know I've repealed the policy.
Oh.
(Gasps) You have?
That's frickin' awesome.
Ruth.
Hi. It's hot under there.
Happy to know you two have patched things up.
Yeah, we have.
Oh, they've been patched.
(Both laughing)
Two times.
I see your hand moving, and I... Wish you'd wait till I left the room.
Ruth: My bad.
Hey. (Chuckles)
Hi.
Hi. Sorry. Um, my hands are...
Staying behind my back, don't worry.
I won't even look at it.
I mean, I-I looked at it just 'cause I said it, but I...
(Chuckles)
Uh... hmm, yeah.
I was gonna ask you...
Foster: Vice Principal? A moment, please?
I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Um, my boss.
Good seeing you.
I'll, uh, see you around.
I hope so.
Principal Foster, I am so sorry. I went overboard.
First off, it's "Dog."
Dog.
Secondly, do not apologize.
I have tried to corral these animals myself.
It's impossible.
Word.
These teachers are straight-up ho's, Dog.
Sometimes you just got to let people follow their urges.
Yes.
I completely agree.
It's too bad we can't.
We can't?
Absolutely not. We're administrators, B.
This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
Two administrators? Perfectly fine.
But, unfortunately, as I've repeatedly told you, I'm not attracted to you.
Right.
You like asians.
So... Exactly.
So that's off the table.
Yeah.
So, do us both a favor...
Lock up that lobster.
(Sighs)
Schmidt:  I still can't believe it. Look at that. "Bringing nasty back."
Nick: "The bad boy of marketing."
That is cool.
So great for my brand.
I mean, I always knew I was a bad boy, but now it's in print and it's official.
Don't call yourself a bad boy.
Am I a bad boy?
You're not a bad boy.

I like 'em going in two different directions.
Like-like cookie monster.
Oh, yeah, like his eyes.
Ooh. Now, see, my boobs got to go "ooh!"
(All chuckling) Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You guys are ruling women out based on their breast size?
It's the least important part of a woman's body.
Unless you're a baby. Are you guys babies?
We're not babies.
I'd like to think that... that you guys see value in women's bodies other than just the way they look.
Come on, Jess, you're really gonna tell me that you don't care what a guy looks like?
Well... I'll notice an attractive man.
I can go to the butcher and pick out a nice rump.
But I'm not gonna rule out a guy based on how he looks... that's shallow.
That's crazy.
Yeah, right. That explains...
So much.
What?
Okay, if you saw me in the bar and I was a stranger, would you rule me out based on my breast size?
Absolutely not. Your breasts are perfect.
Now, if I saw your wonky knee? (Chuckles)
That's a whole 'nother ballgame.
What w... Wonky knee?
You have a wonky knee?
You think I have a wonky knee?
The left knee's perfect.
Uh, but the right one's got some stuff.
Why?
Well, stuff.
Um... oh, why do you think I always let you take your own pants off before sex?
Because you're the laziest person I've ever met.
Wonky knee, huh? (Chuckles)
Like big bird?
(Sighs) I have a Sesame Street problem.
This is what's wrong with men in this country.
You all sit around all day and you read your p*rn magazines What's a p*rn magazine?
And you think that that's what women are supposed to look like.
Well, I have news for you, okay?
Real women are wonky.
Perhaps. But, like climate change, we pretend they don't exist.
(Snickering, laughing)
Right?
Do you guys all just think you're so perfect?
Yeah. Pretty close.
Ah, please.
I mean, you're an eight, you're an eight and a half.
Everybody knows I'm a sweet, sweet six.
Winston, for the last time. Stop rating us.
Jess, I know I'm not perfect, but if you're asking me if I judge, you know, women based off their breasts, then the answer is yes.
Everybody knows that boobs are a direct indicator of personality.
All right... What are you guys doing?
Yeah, how you walking on this thing?
That knee is not architecturally sound.
Coach: I don't trust it.
Man, if you had a jacket on with a bunch of yellow feathers, I'd be done!
I've had enough. This is... insulting.
Ugh. I'm so sorry, I know I don't know you, I know this is your booth, but, uh, my friends are really pissing me off.
I'm just gonna sit here for like... five minutes.
Or maybe ten.
15 to 20 at the most. Probably an hour.
They're super annoying to me.
(Chuckles): Okay.
(Laughs) Why are you mad at your friends?
They're so shallow. They're like...
They say that they have a boob shape preference, but when the chips are down, they'll take anything.
So would it be bad if I told you that I think you're hot?
Shut your gross, beautiful face.
No, I'd love it. Thank you.

Mm. Hey, you, uh, you want to maybe... go out some time?
Yes, I do. Yes.
Should I put my number in your phone or...
Yeah, that's... that works.
Great.
Works for me. But, you know, while-while we're on the subject of stupid physical stuff, you know, I should probably tell you before we go out, uh...
Mm-hmm?
I have a micropenis.
Cool. What?
It's a medical condition... it means I'm unusually small.
Technically, "micro."
Well... Lucky for you... My eyes are bigger than my stomach.
I don't know... what that means. but I'm free tomorrow night.
S04E04
Micro
Coach: It's an actual medical condition.
Here's a web page all about it.
I don't know what I'm looking at.
Where is the...
It's right there. I think. Yeah.
No.
It's like a single tent in a...
A vast, dark forest.
It's like the letter "I" floating around in a bowl of alphabet soup.
Oh, that's awesome... an anteater's being born.
Winston, it's a micropenis, bro.
That's a grown man?
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
Come on, guys, stop it.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Are you honestly going on a date with somebody who has one of these?
Yes, I am, 'cause I don't care what a guy's body looks like.
You know what revs me up?
A fertile mind and a gentle spirit.
A nice, smart guy...
How do you know he's nice? You barely know him.
Man made it through middle school with that ghoulish raisin. He's a hero.
I bet you're not gonna last a week with this guy.
I bet I last at least a month.
You want to put money down?
Oh, absolutely.
500 bucks.
All right.
Winston: Wow.
Great.
Wow.
You said yeah?
If I date him a month, then you will donate 500 bucks to the national organization for women's love your body campaign.
And if you win, I will get you a subscription to the p*rn site of your choosing.
Really?
Yeah.
(Speaking quietly)
Winston: Nubile Nubian Butts.
We know, dude.
Shut up, Winston.
We're gonna go with ass chat.
Ass chat? Come on, what is that... two butts talking to each other?
It's not butts talking to each other.
No, it's all a lot categories.
I'd like you to realize, someday, that a nice, sweet guy who just happens to have a lil' squeaker is just as attractive as a guy with a blue-ribbon hog that's ready for market.
Honey, if you have a blue-ribbon hog, you don't take it to the market, you breed that pig.
(Laughs)
'Cause what's he gonna do at the market?
Jess: Shut up, Nick.
You know what I mean?
Winston, honestly...
I'm sure the national organization of women will look forward to your donation.
Hey, boys, why don't you push heavy up?
Get 'em, heavy.
We got us a bet.
So now I was like screw it grandma.
I'm-a become a street artist, yo.
I mean, most people see a wall and they just see a wall.
I look at a wall and I see, like... a goat in a backpack.
Right.
Like, a ninja handing out cheeseburgers.
Whoa.
A chill alien, you know?
Well, who doesn't see a chill alien?
That's my question.
Lot of people.
Lot of people. It's sad.
You have any tattoos?
No.
I got seven.
Oh, good.
Check it.
Okay.
Custom font.
I invented that font.
Mm-hmm.
Star.
I have a question... do you know of a web site called "ass chat"
and do you know if it's socially conscious?
Just based off the name, I'd say, probably, yeah.
Hey! Okay, so you guys are kind of bringing the bar vibe down, and I need tips, so...
Pretend that you're having fun or pay for me to go to college.
You know, if I could give that poor man some of my penis, I would.
But, obviously, you don't pull a bumper off a Ferrari.
It did go fast, I'll give it that.
You know, when I look at that picture, I think to myself, "is there a God? And if-if there is, did he run out of Clay?"
Winston: I just put five dollars in the jukebox.
We got a Paula Cole rock block coming our way.
I'm just so thankful, you know?
Here we are, beautiful as all heck.
Normal to above-normal endowments.
That's right.
It's like why were we given so much while others were given so little?
I don't understand.
You know, I look at you and I see a stunning physical specimen.
It's like you were created in a la... in a lab. full of gay scientists.
Coach: You have a perfect body, my friend.
You're like the only Jewish Greek God... (Throaty "h"): Hercules.
Thanks, buddy.
You're cute as a button, bro.
Appreciate that.
You're swoll, my friend.
No, look, I work at it.
You're super swoll.
No, it's something I work at.
No, I mean that, though.
It doesn't happen overnight.
It's something that I put the work in, just like you do.
You look good, dude.
Schmidt: We're blessed, the two of us.
Coach: Beyond blessed. Just... I feel like we should be doing more to share our beauty with the world.
Right? It's frustrating.
It's fru... It's frustrating.
So frustrating.
Let me ask you something, guys, haveou er considered modeling?
Now, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.
That's crazy.
What? Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.
Modeling is a real job and, trust me, neither one of you could do it.
Schmidt: What? Give me a break, CeCe.
I could model in my sleep.
Modeling is exactly what these two should be doing.
I bet they would take some amazing pictures.
A drunk baby with a phone in its mouth couldn't take a bad picture of you two.
Oh, well... I mean...
I mean, I mean.
Nick.
Yeah.
Nick, um, uh, I need out of the bet.
Yeah. No, seriously, 'cause, um, he's coming out of the bathroom soon, and, um, he's actually... He's the worst.
So the date's not going well.
I know what you're thinking. It's not 'cause of the thing.
First of all, he's a street artist; Second of all... he called a scotch on the rocks a sko ro.
Ooh, that hurts.
I can't date him for a month... like, I can't even spend like, five minutes with him.
Right. I get it.
So you have to let me out of the bet, please.
You're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is, "he's too small."
No. It's not because of that. He has a... He has a tattoo that just says "Warrior Poet."
Sounds to me like you're being pretty shallow, Jess.
No. He tipped the waiter with a sketch of a hip-hop mouse.
He did? That's incredible.
Yes!
What's up, man?
Do you mind what's up, my man?
If I graffiti your bathroom?
I want to paint a skylight on the floor that looks into hell.
Oh... no, that's okay.
I'd prefer if you didn't.
Matt: Are you sure? Okay.
I'm positive. Yeah.
He's wearing skinny jeans.
They fit him like sweatpants.
Thinking of asking this lovely lady on a second date?
No diggity, no doubt. (Whoops)
We can go speaker shopping, drink some sko ros, if that's where the rhythm takes us...
Mm.
Um, unfortunately, I will be out of town for the next month.
Oh, for trues?
Yeah, for trues.
Hello. This drink is for you, from those gentlemen over there.
You the man.
Skol!
Do you know those bros?
Nope.
Anyway, I'm gonna be out of town for a month, but, uh, we can go out on another date, perhaps when I'm back.
Technically, our, um, one-month anniversary.
Jess, you're not going away for a month.
She keeps forgetting that that got canceled. You're available.
No, but you keep forgetting it was rescheduled.
You weren't on the e-mail.
Okay. That doesn't sound for trues.
For true.
You're not really going out of town, are you?
Oh, gosh. Uh, Matt... (Sighs)
If I'm being honest, I don't think we should go on a second date.
I get it.
Yeah.
It's because of my micropenis.
No!
I looked it up and I-I actually feel like I could make that work. Um...
No, it's...
Don't take this the wrong way, but...
It's actually your personality and everything about you.
You think I'm a douche bag.
You said that you thought street art was the closest thing to an education homeless people would ever get.
Okay.
And I when I asked you, "is that a joke?" You said...
Your mom is a joke.
Yeah. You said, "your mom is a joke."
Right? That's kind of a douchey response.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, I've been made fun of my entire life... in school, in locker rooms... so, yeah, I can be a douche bag sometimes.
But I'm this way... because of my micropenis.
Later.
Radiant. You don't even need Yes, yes. this bounce board. You're making your own light, man.
No doubt, no doubt.
Winston, you getting this?
Oh, hell, yeah, dude. I'm getting all of this.
Flawless.
Yeah, there you go. All right.
Now give me some stuff like it's the first day of school, right?
Okay.
That's right, and you got your backpack on. Yeah, there you go.
But you packed your own lunch. But what you don't know is when you were making it, you got some mustard on your forehead.
That's right.
Now you're playing pictionary, okay?
Now you're playing pictionary, and what do you...
Ooh, now I got... Now I got my little card.
What am I gonna draw? What am I gonna draw?
You get sardines.
They don't smell good.
How do I draw a smell? How do I draw a smell?
What does that look like?
That's modeling. That's right.
Wow, this is great.
Hey, give me five. I got to protein-load.
Schmidt: What do you see we split that last packet of power goo.
I cannot believe that this actually worked.
Oh, man...
No, that's a lie...
I would've been surprised if it didn't.
A classic CeCe-Winston mess around.
That's not a thing.
All right.
So, guys, I was looking at the sh*ts here, and they're really incredible.
I think I could call my modeling agent, if you want.
I know this... we're-we're, like, just doing this for fun and everything, but part of me wants that to happen more than anything else in the whole wide world.
Ugh! No, but my agent probably would only want one of you, and you guys are a team, so I shouldn't call.
Hold on. (Chuckles) You don't want to be rude to the man.
No, no, no, no, no. We don't want to see you guys pitted against each other.
Mm-mm.
P-pitted against each other?
Pit...? What are you talking about?
I think, you know...
I'm more runway.
He's more...
Yeah, I feel like I'm more catalog, high fashion.
Catalog, back of the mag.
You're t... you're too big for high fashion.
Also, my agent really loves piggyback sh*ts, so...
We should piggyback.
We'll piggyback right now.
Oh.
Yeah.
Let me get on, man.
You get on me.
I didn't know you guys had it in you.
I want to be on the bottom.
Let me be on the bottom.
Yeah, yeah, you're a little piggy.
Bottom's my game, dude.
No, me...
You went to the market. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Little piggy went to the market. (Laughs)
Just let me... (Groans)
Damn it. No.
Oh, yeah.
It's like sh**ting candy into a baby.
Mm...
That's it. That's it.
Yeah, give me that. Give me that!
I could... I could...
I can totally dig this.
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
I know you're bummed and so I hate to do this, but I want to look at p*rn and you owe me a year's worth.
Yeah, okay. You know what?
You earned this p*rn.
And the vip pass.
And the "Kitty Room live cam experience."
Do you really need all of this?
Just click the boxes.
Matt was right. I am shallow.
It's like I jumped to a conclusion about him, but I didn't have the whole story.
I thought I was better than you guys. Mm...
But I'm a superficial size queen.
Coach: Hey, guys?
Can you tell schmidt that my portfolio is way better than his portfolio?
Look at that: I'm better wet, I'm better dry, my sexy baby is way more believable than his.
Watch, look... mama change baby 'cause baby made a dirty...
Schmidt: Okay, mine is way more sexy.
There are people lining up in the streets to have sex with my baby.
Liar!
I don't like this.
You can't use that photo, unless you're planning on posing for the tiny nipples of America foundation.
Schmidt: Yeah, you're one to talk, little miss princess waist!
Hey, I'm a 26! That's normal!
Yeah, in Asia.
Who's talking to you, depression-era garbage man?
I've been holding that in for two years.
I said one thing.
Guys, stop attacking each other!
Come on. He's making fun of you
'cause he feels sensitive about his geisha waist.
And you're putting him down
'cause you've got those cute little kitten teats.
Everybody has something.
She's right, you know. She's right.
Look, I grew up fat, and I have scars that you can't see.
And I'm not talking about the stretch marks that I had removed by laser beams.
Mm.
No matter how many miles I run, I'll never outrun that feeling.
Damn, son.
I didn't even know it was like that.
It'll always be like that, my man.
Still better than having a micro penis.
So much better.
Yeah.
It's true.
Guys!
We're all covered in micro penises.
No, I'm not.
Coach: Come again?
No, thank you.
I don't want to be covered in anything.
No, it's not true.
Yes! Yes! No! We all have flaws!
We're all freaks!
All of us.
We have to support each other!
I knew it!
I am better than you guys.
Thank you for helping me realize that.
I know now why I was superficial.
It's because I was scared.
Of my micro...
No. No!
Of mine.
What?!
I'm saying that we should all celebrate our flaws! Together!
I'm saying that...
The one day I wear jeans.
(Groans)
I'm saying, look. We're exactly the same.
I'm sorry, what-what am I looking at?
This monstrosity the doctors call a knee that I didn't know was a problem till, like, three days ago.
What the hell is this?!
You have a girlfriend?
He did!
Whoa, whoa... How can... no, no, no!
Matt: How dare you!
That's w*r question mark!
How dare you don't answer me!
Think I should go.
You owe me $12,000! (Door slams)
Wait, wait... Jess, I can explain.
Okay, why are you not running after your girlfriend right now?
Aah, if I'm being totally honest, she was getting a little fat.
No, she was... that's crazy!
I wouldn't behave like this if someone, just once...
(Voice breaking): Just once, took the time to get to know...
You're not even crying!
You are unbelievable!
Is anything about you real? Anything? Do you even have a micro penis, or is that...?
It... it... looks like a... little tiny... pigeon's egg.
Don't you want to hatch the bird?
No, I definitely, definitely do not.
You're... you're a very complicated person.
Um...
But I'm glad I met you.
Sort of.
I mean, I don't know why, but... I kind of am.
Anyway, take care of that little rug-rat.
He needs you.
Hey, man.
Oh, hey. I'm just, uh...
It's all right.
I'm just, I'm just looking over some of the pics from today.
I don't know which one to send to the agent.
I've narrowed it down to 60.
I can take a look at 'em.
Yeah, okay.
Just tell me what you think about a couple of these.
I just, I don't know what's what at this point.
This "hot guy with a kidnapped son..."
Wow.
He really looks like he's never gonna find his son.
"Classical guitarist loses a shoe."
That guy's never gonna find his shoe.
I don't know.
This is "cuddles with tigers."
Oh-ho.
It's good.
This is "how did I get up here?"
What do you think about this one?
"Kiss the cook."
See, I like "kiss the cook."
It's catalogue.
His lips are popping.
There's an accessibility with this one that I feel like...
Schmidt, relax. I'm bowing out.
I want you to have this.
Come on. What?!
Why are you doing that, coach?
Because you obviously need this more than I do.
When you look in the mirror, you see a fat kid.
I don't. I don't know how that feels.
I do. It's my micro-p, yo.
If there's anything that could finally help you get over your body image issues, it's modeling.
That's for sure.
Yeah.
'Cause you're not a fat kid anymore, man.
You are a model.
Now, say it.
I don't know.
Say, "I'm a model."
I'm a model.
Say it louder.
It doesn't feel real.
I need to hear you say it, or else I'm not gonna believe it, man.
I'm just saying, it's hard... I'm a model.
That's better.
Hold on.
I'm a model.
Good.
I'm a male model...
You are a male model.
I'm a male model!
What is happening?
What did we do?
I don't know.
(Whoops, laughs)
Thanks, coach.
Mm.
Now, go journal.
I'm gonna go journal.
Right on, man.
Mm.
Coach: Um... What's going on with you two?
Hey.
What?! Nothing.
Man, we just being mega-cool over here.
Mm-hmm.
What is going on, guys?!
Wait. Hold...
Hold on.
Was all this a classic CeCe and Winston mess-around?!
No!
Yes. Yeah.
Do not acknowledge that is a thing.
It's not a thing.
Now, look, okay, look, we got a little carried away, but how are we supposed to know he was gonna get emotionally invested?
This will destroy him. You know that, right?
You two got to make him a model.
I did not mean to hurt Schmidt, okay?
But I can't make him into a model!
Not in modern-day America.
In 1970s Israel... Mm-hmm.
Maybe.
Get... it... done.
I hate when Schmidt cries.
Sounds like a ghost singing "hey ya!"
♪ Hey ya ♪
♪ Hey ya, oh, oh-oh ♪
♪ I want to be your daddy... ♪
Fix it!
It's glorious, isn't it?
How did this happen?
Are there just no laws in koreatown?
Uh, well, uh, CeCe's agent saw Schmidt's portfolio and loved it.
Yeah, yeah, he, uh... he fast-tracked it.
That-that's an industry term.
So, what am I selling here anyway?
Oh, uh, you know, uh, Korean-Jewish interrelations.
All right.
I wanted to tell you that, um, the bank cancelled my credit card after I ordered you p*rn.
That's okay, I wanted to cancel it anyway.
You paying for it kind of k*lled it for me.
Yeah.
Just made me sad for everybody involved.
I wanted to give those girls a hug and say, "wipe your face, go back to school, honey."
Coach: So, guys, when does Schmidt get paid for this?
Well... The agency is pretty tapped Uh-huh. after spending $1,887 on this billboard.
Well, why don't the Jew-Koreans pay for it?
Well, it's an international thing.
See? So, there's fees.
Coach: Yeah, but you said he would get a check for $500.
Yes.
Congrats, bro.
You deserve that $500.
Let's head out.
I think I'm gonna stay here for a little bit, take this all in.
All right.
Tell me more about this internet p*rn. Is there anything I would like?
Like something with a story, you know?
I don't think you'd like it.
Nothing about Victorian England or anything like that?
Oh, there's some stuff, I don't think you would like it.
Millionaire!
Hey, Nick?
(whispers) Shh, I'm reading.
Can you just give me a second?
What do you want this time?!
So, I'm... I'm pitching on the sponge account today.
It's kind of a... it's kind of a big deal.
I'm just wondering why my idea notebook is covered in crimson stains.
Oh, that's a fair question.
It's either Sloppy Joes, or it's blood.
(groans)
You unbelievable pig person!
You giant, fat pig person! You sloth.
You should be living in a tree in Costa Rica, you know that?
Hi, guys. Um, have either of you seen the French press?
The French press is in cupboard 64B. Did you not consult your item map?
No, I looked there. The Tagine's in 64B.
What is the Tagine doing in 64 frickin' B?!
I used the French press.
Everybody chill out. So it's in here somewhere.
Nick, you know you're not allowed to use the French press.
I use it to get the pulp out of my juice.
So just give me one second, I'll find it.
(chuckles): Hold on. Oh, yeah.
I wasn't looking for it, but I found my pulp bowl.
That is a crystal candy bowl filled with orange goop.
I don't need to sit here and take this! I'm going to my study.
You are gonna get back here and clean your room, mister!
JESS: Guys, I still need the French press.
Winston, I need my study corner!
No, not after last time.
Hey, Winnie! You know there's an Albany in California?
(chuckles): Well, hello, Winston Bishop.
I towel-b*rned my unders.
Well, I just prairie-dogged thanks to you guys.
Stop fighting! Now the bathroom stinks for no reason.
You happy, Schmidt? You just scared Coach's poop!
No, I'm not happy. I'm poor, and I'm living in a filthy thimble.
I've gone from riches to rags. It's reverse Annie.
Oh, spoiler alert. Now you just ruined Annie.
(men arguing)
JESS: Guys, chill out!
Schmidt, your people have been selling sponges since the days of Abraham. You got this.
Nick, the pulp bowl is real gross. Tighten up.
Most importantly, my dad is coming with his new girlfriend, and I need the French press.
Oh, 64B. The Tagine is in 64B.
64B is occupied!
Uh, he said the Tagine is in 64B.
It stinks in there! What did you do?!
You k*ll an animal?!

How long before you unleash holy hell on your dad's new girlfriend?
I want to make sure I got a good seat and plenty of snacks.
Okay, Cecilia, look, I know I've been a little bit hard on my dad's girlfriends in the past...
I know you stole my dad's credit card, Margot.
h*t the damn road.
I don't have a car.
(whispers): Find one.
I was the one who had to pick up the pieces when his heart got broken.
Besides, to hear my dad talk, it sounds like he has really found someone who... is good for him.
Ha!
And you believe that?
Your dad has terrible taste in women.
That's why I love him so much.
Remember the one who pretended to be a paraplegic?
Get up!
I can't!
Oh, whatever.
That's the last one I met, and I'm lucky he's letting me meet this one.
So, what? You're just gonna be nice to her? No fireworks? No show?
I'm gonna be nice to her no matter who she is.
Then what the hell am I doing here?
(knocking)
Oh.
Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi.
Hi, Daddy.
Gee, I'm sorry we're late, you know, but we saw Seal at the airport.
We talked to him for 20 minutes, got his autograph.
Wasn't him.
No.
Anyway, this is Ashley.
Hi.
I think, um, we went to high school... together.
You went to high school together!
We went to high school together!
Julie Berkman's older sister Ashley?
That's me.
(Cece laughs)
Is this fun or what? (laughs)
(whispering): Oh, my God!
(whispering): Your dad is dating Trashley Berkman?
Didn't she... ?
Yes. She sexually intercoursed my high school boyfriend George Jiang underneath the bleachers.
While you were sitting...
Yes! While I was sitting on those bleachers.
Have you ever seen sex from above, Cece?
It's horrible. That's why God thinks it's a sin.
Also, Trashley gave him giardia in his belly ring.
Giardia is a river disease.
She had river mouth.
Wasn't George Jiang, like, six-11?
Yeah. They called him George Jiang the Giardia Giant, and I never got to hold him in my arms.
What are you gonna do?!
Uh...
Uh... nothing.
I'm gonna be sweet and kind and supportive.
Look, peop-peop... people change.
People change. It's been 15 years.
She had sex with our DARE officer!
No way.
There were rumors flying around about every damn one.
(chuckles)
You remember the rumor about me? What?
Oh, that you shaved your chin?
Was that was the rumor about me?
That was the rumor.
No. It was... definitely sexier than that.
Thank you guys for coming. It's really helpful that you're here.
I'm trying to get my boss to give me the new account.
I just have to figure out how to sell sponges to men.
What do I have? I have a blood-stained idea notebook filled with terrible ideas.
I don't know what to do, you guys.
Damn it!
"Spongey make wipey." I like that.
Okay, please. I don't have a lot of time.
This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna say the word "sponge", and you guys are gonna say the first word that pops into your head, okay? Ready, one, two, three. Sponge.
Sponge!
Yellow.
Sponge.
That was mine.
Okay, let's just try this. We're gonna try this one more time.
Okay? Just clear your head, okay?
So I'm gonna say the word, and you're gonna say the first word that pops in your head.
Okay, it might be "sponge." Don't say "sponge."
Sponge!
Sponge.
Damn it! Focus!
I'm sorry. Okay, let's just try it again.
Give me a sh*t. Give me a sh*t. Give me a sh*t.
I'm gonna say "sponge" one more time, first word that pops into your head. Ready? One, two, three, sponge.
Sponge. Aah!
Winston!
Sorry. So much pressure, man.
Okay, you know what? Let's move on to Coach.
Coach, here we go. You're the man of the group.
You should be good at this. We're selling sponges to men.
Ready, one, two, three, sponge.
Sponge.
Why would you say that?
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, come on, come on. Sponge.
Cake.
What?
Cake. No!
Sponge cake.
We all know that men are idiots.
How long have you been in my office?
But what we don't know is how much they love to clean.
You're wasting my time, Schmidt. Go.
Come on, Gina, you have to give me this account.
They want to market sponges to men. I'm the only man in the office.
Oh, speaking of. Sherri, you got the sponge account!
Touchdown! Yeah.
Just hear me out here.
The reason why men don't talk about how much they love to clean is because they're afraid to admit it.
Give me a chance here. Be the one to put Schmidt on the map.
Let's blast America right in the face with a little bit of Schmidt.
Oh! God in heaven! Fine!
Put together a focus group, okay?
I will do that. This is exciting.
All right. Maybe next week we'll start it?
No. Today, 3:00.
Today... today at 3:00?
Today at 3:00?
Mm-hmm.
3:00 today... that sounds great.
I love that idea.
Mm-hmm, you just... you just earned a special thank you in my autobiography.
Working title: Punting the Sweet Fantastic.
I feel like you kind of have to do something to write a book about yourself.
Sports!
(screams)
Oh, it's just so great to see you guys again.
Will you please remind me?
Were you there my first senior year or my second?
I was not good at high school.
(Bob and Ashley laugh)
Oh, the early 2000s.
God, I did so much E.
Just doing E, watching that show Ed.
I would love to know how you two lovers met.
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, sure.
Okay, so I was listening to him sing with his band, The Co-Pays.
Yeah, well...
I didn't know you were in a band, Dad.
Yeah, just... just me and a few other pharmacists.
You know, we do alt rock covers.
Oh, man, when he started singing "She's So High"...
♪ She's so high... ♪
Stop. Because I'm gonna fall in love again.
Okay, go, I want to.
♪ She's so high... ♪
ASHLEY (sighs): Oh.
Oh, man. That was it. I was done.
Ashley, have you kept in touch with our DARE officer?
Oh! Cece.
Oh. Okay, I... I get it.
You guys heard about that rumor that I had sex with the DARE officer?
No! Only a crazy person...
That rumor was true.
(stammers)
Crazy fun person.
Oh, yeah, that guy.
Wow, I did not just say no. I said yes.
Oh, yeah.
I just said, "Yes, yes, yes."
Oh, she said yes a lot.
(laughs) She's had sex with hundreds of guys.
Yeah. You know, we spent some time trying to total them all up.
It was fun.
k*lled a whole Saturday. Yeah.
We couldn't even get through the list.
We got to the "Ls."
(laughs)
But that was in the past.
And then I was diagnosed with a sex addiction.
Oh, great.
Thankfully, I attended rehab.
Which... did not take the first time.
Or the second.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
But third time's the charm.
For a lot of people. Not for me.
For me, it took four. Four times.
Well, Bobby, we should get ready to go to the beach.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you so much for this delicious brunch, Jess.
It was wonderful.
I ate so much, I'm gonna have to bang nine guys just to work it off. (laughs)
Oh, my goodness.
(Bob laughs)
I'm kidding. I did do that once, but I'm not gonna do it this time.
It's all in the past for me.
Isn't she great?
I just love her.
She makes me laugh so much.
(groaning)
What? What... what, are you humming?
Mm... Dad, just so we have this conversation...
No, no, Jess.
She seems like the type of girl who might hurt you.
Jessica...
I've seen you get hurt by a lot less.
Please, don't... don't go there.
No matter what you say, you're not gonna change my mind.
I'm in love with her, and I'm gonna marry her.
Gonna... get a new mom, Jess.
BOB: ♪  She's so high... ♪
Hey, are you okay? Because I am not sure if you heard that, but there is going to be a wedding.
Oh... there will be no wedding.
And it begins.
Why are we meeting in a parking garage?
Because what we are doing is unsavory and we're hiding from God.
And you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...
Yeah, you definitely did.
Yes, there'll be pizza.
Just do one thing for me first.
Here, memorize these.
That's yours. That's yours.
"I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand."
Look, I had to scramble, you guys.
I told my bosses how much men love to clean.
What are talking about?
Only you.
Yeah, only...
Yeah. I know!
Why do you think I'm rigging this focus group?
"Sponges make me feel more exhilarated than any home run or touchdown ever could."
This is ridiculous, man. I'm out!
I can buy my own pizza.
Can somebody please loan me $15?
Maybe like 20, 25, depending on toppings, 'cause I'd love to get a bunch of ham.
Ham. What about the tip, dude?
What about tip?
I don't give tips. It's for delivery. You don't tip delivery people, ever.
You definitely tip delivery people, but...
Guys. Guys.
I get sponges, this solves all our problems. Okay?
I make more money, Nick gets his room back, I get my life back on track.
Punting the Sweet Fantastic.
For the last time, Schmidt, that doesn't mean anything!
Fine. But I'm gonna need one hour in a quiet room to get into character.
No.
Right on.
After long and thoughtful and careful consideration, Winston is in.
Okay.
Assuming pizza is still on the table.
Say "pizza" one more time, Winston.
No, just don't.
Just don't.
No, we just never talked about when we're gonna...
Don't.
Just don't bring it up. He's getting really mad.
Like, delivery of... Say "pizza."
Say "pizza" one more time.
Don't say it again.
Say "pizza" again.
Pizza.
Say "pizza" one more time, I'm gonna k... k*ll you!
I just thought maybe we'd talk about toppings, perhaps, or something.
Not a mirror.
Not a mirror, you idiot.
Not a mirror.
Sponges make me feel exhilarated more than any...
Did you just say "sponges make me feel exhilarated"?
(chuckles): No, no. I... I..
What do you think of sponges?
They're stupid.
That's how I feel. (laughs)
I mean, who cares?
Ex... That's exactly how I feel.
What do you think of this whole place?
I'd rather not be here.
"Be here" is what I was about to say.
(both laughs)
I'm Nick.
I'm Brittany.
Oh, my God, we have so much in common.
Okay.
My dad can't marry her.
He gets hurt in relationships with normal women.
Yeah. He can't handle a recovering sex addict.
No.
What if she relapses?
It would crush him. It would crush his heart.
I can't let this happen. I have to protect him.
So what are you gonna do?
I could write him a letter about my feelings.
We... Yeah, but her phone is in her purse, and we could check her phone for dirt on her.
But he hates letters.
He always gets so frustrated opening the envelope.
You know you want to check her phone. You know you want to.
Cece, we're adults; we're gonna handle this like adults.
We're not snooping.
You're right, you're right.
That is... that's a huge violation of privacy; you can't do that.
Put that... What does it say?
It's bad. Mm.
Give that to me.
(gasps)
Dad, she's cheating on you!
What?
Yeah, just ask Jim.
At 10:40, Jim heard she was in town.
At 11:52, Jim had his hands down his pants.
And at 11:53...
Cumin? What, is he cooking cumin?
(clears throat)
Oh, my God.
My dad is the best guy in the world, and you better h*t the damn road, unless you want to say hello to my old friends Crabtree and Evelyn.
That's my work phone. I'm a sex therapist.
Jim is my client.
Your... your client?
Client!
Client.
Client.
Client.
Am I supposed to say "client" now?
I'm gonna go. This was clearly a mistake.
No.
And for the record,
George Jiang gave me giardia.
I saved you from a hideous river disease.
Thank you.
Damn it. She won't answer any of my calls.
I left ten voice mails.
Two of them, I'm screaming. Three, I'm crying.
One is a long silent one. Nothing!
And it's all your fault... both of you guys.
But mostly you.
Look, Dad, I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do...
There's nothing more that you can do.
I... I knew this was a mistake bringing her here.
Wait, Dad.
(door slams)
SCHMIDT: So, uh, why don't you tell me what you think about that sponge there, Coach.
I mean... (clears throat) Ernie.
I don't know why I would call you Coach.
Okay. Um... (clears throat)
Well, I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.
Wow, thank you so much for that.
I wish my buddies could see me now.
What?
They'd be all like, "Hey, man, let me get a h*t of that squishy whip."
Right on. Way to, uh, add your own take.
Uh, to-to your... to your own take.
WINSTON: You know, I... I have something I'd like to add.
Please.
Um, I like cleaning.
You like cleaning.
It is the only thing I can control in a world filled with chaos.
Thank you.
May I add, I am Thor, and this is my hammer, Mjolnir.
M... Melnir. Mjolnir.
Okay, wonderful detail. Thank you so much for that.
Uh, how about you down there, Mayor of the Corner?
(chuckles)
(pounds table) Nick.
What?
How does cleaning make you feel?
Uh, like I-I'm cleaning. Move on to somebody else, please.
(quietly): Read the cards that I gave you. Remember the cards?
Not now.
(pounds table) Read your cards!
You want to know what I think about your sponges?!
(imitates farting)
(laughs)
(laughs)
Well, this is clearly rigged.
My office. Now, Schmidt.
Schmidt...
Schmidt, I'm sorry.
(door closes)
Dad.
Thanks for waiting.
I wasn't waiting. I just can't get this damn thing started.
You're just pressing buttons.
This was supposed to be a big weekend for me and Ashley.
I had everything planned.
I... I even wrote new lyrics to our... our song.
(high-pitched): ♪ Ashley, marry me... ♪
(engine starts)
Y... you didn't have to do that, you know.
I can take care of myself.
Can you? Dad, if I hadn't protected you after you and Mom's divorce, you would've ended up with Nancy Zimmerman.
Oh, Nancy Zimmerman.
She was bad news, Dad.
Ooh, v... very bad. You don't know the half of it.
That woman made me try cocaine in 2005.
What, Dad?! Booger sugar?
Yes.
Nicaraguan yazz.
Are you kidding me?
It was a very expensive evening.
I wound up buying his and her Jet Skis.
The point is I'm still standing, and I can take care of myself.
Yes, I might get hurt, but that'll be my problem.
You don't need to do it anymore, Jess.
I should be taking care of you.
Ashley is different from any woman I've ever dated.
She... she makes every day better.
I... I want to spend the rest of my life with her.
Aw, Dad, that's so sweet.
(car alarm chirps)
Hey!
Hey, Th... Ashley!
JESS: What did she do? She went out and found a guy?
She's gonna relapse. Um...
Oh, we have to turn her off. Ashley...
Let's turn on NPR and blare it.
Oh...
Ashley, wait. Wait a minute. Please. Please don't do this. Please.
JESS: Ashley, if you're gonna relapse, relapse with my dad.
I'm not relapsing.
This is Roy. He's my L.A. sponsor.
BOB: This is Roy? Oh!
You know, I... I always wanted to meet you. Hi.
Jess, he's not a strange man.
He's a sex addict.
Former sex addict. Uh, current chocoholic.
I'd be in trouble if you were black.
Thank you?
Ashley, look, I screwed up.
I have to let my dad make mistakes.
Oh, I'm a mistake?
No, you are not a mistake.
That came out wrong.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I never meant to come between you and your daughter.
I love you so damn much.
You're my big, round, bald, fuzzy Weeble-Wobble.
But I just... I just need a little space.
It's not over, Dad.
Get the ring.
I'm sorry, Schmidt. What can I say?
You're just not really built to play with the big girls.
Don't f*re him!
Oh, God.
What the... Why?
Give him the account.
He's a hard worker, and he's a neat freak.
How do I know that? 'Cause I share a room with him.
You two share a room?
And you should see his side.
It is so clean. It looks like the inside of a Japanese subway.
Speaking of sharing a bedroom, Brittany's coming over tonight.
Uh, so I'm gonna need ten to 15 minutes of privacy for...
I don't need 15 minutes. That's excessive.
Give me five to ten.
That feels braggy. Give me three to five, but no less than three 'cause that's rude to girls.
Do you really think that she's gonna have sex with you in that pulp-covered filth bunker? - I'll throw a tarp down.
Oh, God.
SCHMIDT: What if she's turned off by the mess? What if she's turned off by...
What if she's turned off by the mess?
Hey, Gina, why don't you hear me out here for a second.
That's all right.
If Nick cleans his room before Brittany comes over, he might get laid.
I don't know. It seems like a lot of work.
Not with the right tool.
We open up on a modern man with a nose that only America could love.
This might seem obvious, but what side does the dirty stuff go on?
He doesn't know a lot, but he's about to discover the ultimate wingman.
NICK: I bet this side is really good for tough areas.
The Man Sponge.
Because the dirtiest thing in your room...
Probably be her. (chuckles)
Yay. We're doing a pitch.
Yeah. (chuckles)
I... can't believe I'm saying this, but I like it.
All right, you get the sponge account, Schmidt.
Sponges. We got sponges.
We got sponges. We got sponges. We got sponges.
JESS: Wait!
Ashley! My dad loves you!
No matter what! Wait!

I don't know.
I mean, are you okay?
You need to do it now, Dad, before we get flattened by a parade. Come on.
Ashley... will you marry me?
And be the stepmom to a very crazy but... but very lovable woman?
(chuckles): Yes.
Yes. Yes!
Oh, yes!
Jess, you're my little girl now.
Oh, Jess.
You go to your room. (laughs): I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding. But you should go to a-a hospital.
Here's to attending a wedding with everyone from high school and my dad's side of the family.
It's gonna be great. It's like going to prom with all my dad's friends.
NICK: Hear, hear!
(cheering)
Oh. Oh.
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry, don't worry.
I got it. I got it. I'll just clean it.
COACH: Dude, there's a sponge in your hand.
SCHMIDT: No, let him go.
He's my inspiration. You know, living with him in that slovenly hellhole has been a secret blessing.
It's made me stronger.
Without ash to rise from, the phoenix would just be a bird getting up.
I am a phoenix, and I will rise.
He usually says that speech before sex.
By 2015, I will have my own room. And by 2016...

Hey, look who it is! It's Schmidt. And...
This is Barb. Barb is leaving.
Oh, Barb. Like the elephant.
That's Babar, you dum-dum.
Barbara. A little potassium pick-me-up?
Since I know sleeping wasn't the main activity of the night.
Thin walls. Just kidding. They're very thick.
You're just so loud! (chuckles)
You have a lot of roommates.
So many of 'em. That's great.
Bye, Barb.
Bye, Barb.
Bye, Schmidt.
(door shuts)
That was the third piece of nanny this week, am I right?
Sure is.
Little shop talk from someone who's also out there trying to crush butt herself.
Um, where are you meeting all these eligible singles, these, uh, elly-sings?
Dice.
Hmm?
It's kind of like Tinder. Dice and Tinder.
I've been to those bars. They're downtown, right?
(groans)
Dice is a dating app.
Dating app. What?
It's not for you.
Schmidty.
Come on. I've Internet dated before.
You send an e-mail, you get excited, you wait, you get an e-mail back.
You are just describing e-mailing.
Come on.
You're gonna get eaten alive on Dice.
Do you want to see...
Come on, now.
Do you want to see... This is Dice. Come here.
It's all about split-second decisions, okay?
You see a picture, you swipe down for yes, you swipe up for no.
JESS: You're so fast.
Instinct. That's what it's about.
Which you don't have.
Now, I'm gonna go do a deep-ass mouthwash.
Don't go on Dice, Jess.
I won't.
Okay, now.
New account.
I am... Darn tootin' fun.
DTF.
Seeks same.
I'm Dicing.
WINSTON: You know, I'm really enjoying the police academy,
but, believe it or not, I am not clicking socially with the other cadets.
What? Weird.
Oh, my God.
No. That's crazy.
That is super shocking news.
I can't wrap my head around that.
That just doesn't add up.
Everyone's got a nickname but me.
Yo, Swoops! What up, g*n? (chuckles)
Hey, Winston Bishop.
Why don't you just go ask them if you can hang out with them sometime?
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
Just invite myself? Now, that's just rude.
Winnie the Bish wasn't raised to be rude.
Now, save my seat. I got to go make a caca.
I can't believe we're gonna live with a cop.
I mean, can we still do illegal things? Like, I don't know, what if I want to get stoned or something?
I've actually never gotten stoned before.
You've never been stoned?
What?
Should I do it before he becomes a cop?
We could do this.
Really?
We're adults. We can smoke a little weed.
I think we should do it.
It's been a while.
I pick up stuff really quick.
You can't just pick up pot and be good at it.
Like everything else in life, it takes practice.
Yeah, if pot were a piano, Nick would be a nine year old Chinese girl.
Daddy's here to take care of you. I'm gonna guide you through it.
I'll be your spiritual guru.
And Mommy's got nothing to do this afternoon, so I'm gonna bake some damn brownies so we can all freak out.
Let's do it.
We're getting stoned?
This is like watching a meeting of idiot 12 year olds.
The hell is that? What is that noise?
(ringtone playing)
Your cellular technology.
I haven't gotten a non text message in two years.
Jess?
Hey, uh... So, I Diced and it was great. Um, but could I get a ride?
You sure you don't want to hop on for a second?
Do you have a dog, or is this all you?
Which would you prefer?
(barks)
Schmidt, will you at least just talk to me, please?
He looked nice in his picture.
The frame cut off the bottom of his beard, so how was I to know it was braided into a beardy tail?
Mmm.
He asked me to the food court near his house.
I thought that was down to earth, and I liked that.
He didn't bring any money, so we had to go back to his apartment.
And also he wanted to show me some of his old baby clothes.
(groans)
Maybe I'm not ready for Dice.
Will you just help me, please?
I want to get back out there. I have to...
I need to get back out there.
And I know I'm gullible.
'Cause people tell me that, and I have no reason not to believe them.
Teach me to Dice.
Is that a yes?
(mutters)
Schmidt?
What's happening?
Ah! What the hell?
I will teach you Dice.
Welcome and... good morning.
It's weird here in the morning.
It is very sad.
Now, over the next 1,000 minutes, your notions of dating will be challenged.
Jess, just listen. No notes.
I'm sorry.
You put notebooks and pens on the table, so I thought...
I totally get it.
Look, Jess, you're nervous. Would you like some water?
Oh, thank you.
Of course.
That's really nice of...
Never show weakness.
Write that down. Now, you're on Dice and this hunk shows up.
Hubba hubba, mama in trubba.
Don't ever do that again.
Okay. So you find this man. He looks like a Hemsworth, if you will.
He swipes down, you swipe down, you guys set a date. I show up.
Hey, how you doing? I'm Jack Steele.
Hi, Jack.
(buzzing)
Wrong.
Is that our Taboo buzzer?
Not important. Why did I buzz?
Do you think you could just return it to the box when you're done?
The reason I buzzed is because I look nothing like this person.
Look at this. There's a sun-kissed sweetie.
I am a rugged Semitic prince.
I thought we were role playing.
Role playing?
What about this feels like a game to you?
(buzzing)
(phone chimes)
Ooh, I got a Dice match.
Jacob.
He has dreamy eyes.
Them's joint bank account eyes.
Okay, if you're saying things like "dreamy eyes" to my face, we have more work to do than the Kings of Leon.
Good band, but it feels like they are stuck in one place musically.
Well, I have a good feeling about this guy.
Okay.
I'm gonna ask him out.
Hey.
You're not ready yet.
I'm s... I'm sorry about your phone.
I'm sure you have the protection plan.
I do have the...
(buzzing)
Never get the protection plan!
NICK: The oceans are very wild.
No man or piece of scientific technology has ever been to the bottom of the ocean.
Titanic did.
Uh, Titanic sunk down there, but that's not to the bottom.
No, the man who made Titanic did.
I don't know what Manhoo is, but...
You guys seem a lot higher than me.
Well, it hits everybody at different times, Hoss.
But it's coming for you.
My people! (chuckles)
Time to rally, everybody. We are going to a party.
I took Cece's advice and decided to invite myself to hang out with some of the other guys, and I think y'all should roll with.
Make me look cooler.
I'll totally go to a party on your butt.
What?
(laughing)
No. No.
Now, that is a humorous image.
What?
But, seriously, you have to go.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Know-know what? We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
Okay. We're gonna go.
We're gonna go. We're gonna go.
You're gonna go?
Hey, we're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
Right on, right on.
Well, then we'll go.
(chuckling): Yeah.
You guys are way too messed up to be going.
You're not an expert. I am.
Nobody knows we're stoned.
If we didn't go, then they would know.
You're saying that be... if we don't go to the party, they're gonna think that we're high.
Oh, the guy who's never done weed.
That's not the proper term. It's "smoked weed."
You don't "do weed." That's a test.
You said it. Listen to me, first order of business, we eat their food.
Okay.
Then you look at the pool.
"Aw, what a great pool.
I wish... I wish I could dive for rings."
Because if you were stoned, you wouldn't dive for rings.
Um, I was just thinking of this impression.
Who am I doing?
Who am I doing?
Al Pacino?
Maybe. So, then, you get home, you eat some pizza...
Trust me. I just thought of every single possibility of what could happen at that party, and none of them are bad.
Ooh. Wow.
This is a big party. I'm talking wall-to-wall cops.
Man.
Oh, I did not think this through.
(giggling)
It just h*t me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
And that is why... No matter how tricked out it is...
You never get into a van.
"...van."
Okay, moving on.
Classic warning signs.
Now, last night, the crazy man said he needed to meet you near his house.
What he was really saying was, "I expect tonight to end in sex."
Or maybe he doesn't like to be far from his pets.
Never date a man with pets. The only acceptable pet for a man to have is a saltwater fish. Okay, what now?
Okay, first test. Now, I'm gonna say something, and you tell me what's really being said.
Oh, you know, I'm just staying in a hotel right now.
"I like to travel."
(buzzing)
Homeless. Pervert.
Oh, my God, my mom is just the most amazing woman.
Oh. "I love my mother."
(buzzing)
Virgin. And somehow also a pervert.
I kind of prefer public transportation.
Oh. Earth-conscious.
(buzzing)
Multiple DUIs.
(buzzing)
Pervert.
Okay, time for the next phase.
Next phase?
Jess?
Hi. I'm Malcolm. From Dice?
Oh...
Oh.
Hi.
Hey.
She'll be with you in just a minute.
Okay.
You set me up on a date? I'm wearing my lounge-around underwear. I set you up on ten dates.
What?
Ten years of experience in one day.
Expert by midnight.
The Dice Diez.
"Diez" is Spanish for ten.
Are you insane, Schmidt? I'm not ready.
That's like taking a musical from rehearsals straight to Broadway. You got to workshop it first...
If you are for one second suggesting that I don't know how to open a musical...
How dare you? I'm trying to help you out here.
Now, of course you're not ready, Jess.
That's why I set up ten dates.
Now, you can do this. Come on.
All right.
So...
So.
Date talk.
Okay. (chuckles) What do you do?
Um, well, I don't have a job, currently, right now, in the traditional "nine to five" sense, but, uh, I got a lot cooking.
I "grow" "raisins."
I'm sorry, Malcolm, um, I'm gonna have to... (whispering): Get out of there. let you finish that story.
Oh, okay. I grow two types of raisins.
There's the Leopold raisin, which is from Austria.
Mm-hmm.
And then there's the Zwiebel raisin, which is also from Austria.
But I think the main thing that got me through my time in prison was the realization that a "raisin" can be anything.
We got to go!
(in Southern accent): Ma called. The bees are back.
Ma called. The bees are back.
Oh, okay. Um...
Should I just... Should I wait for you?
You know that was a bad date, right?
I know, but I just felt so trapped.
Just do what I did, make up an excuse and then leave.
Just, just say as little as you need to, okay?
Make it your own.
You ready? Yeah.
You can do this.
Okay.
You have so much hair. What?
Where did all that hair come from?
You're like a lioness.
So, did you know you could put a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it without plucking it or preparing it at all?
(whispering): Keep it simple.
Uh, let's keep it simple.
You're a nice guy, and that's a neat outfit.
Are you a chef? Are you a beatnik?
Are... Do you work on... on a submarine?
Shh.
No! No!
Oh. Stand down, sir!
We found your son.
He's alive.
They found my son; he's alive.
I'm sorry. It was nice meeting you.
WINSTON: All right, now, remember, y'all are my dogs, okay?
So just stay by my side and make me look cool.
If I tell a joke, dogs got to bark.
(laughs) I want to see those tails wagging out there, okay?
Oh, okay, look.
Look, there's Dugan. There's Dugan.
That's the guy I was telling you about. Come on.
Over there is better.
All right.
What?
Whatever the hell that means.
Is there a cop in the house? (laughs)
I feel really calm. Really relaxed.
Oh, look, a hummingbird.
What the hell are you talking about?
There's no such thing as a hummingbird.
Birds don't hum.
They sing.
They basically invented singing.
You're so high right now, man.
You're so high, I couldn't possibly even bring you back.
Actually, dude, I feel really good.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, when you walk, you look like an insane person.
Okay? And your voice sounds so stoned and crazy.
Say something.
Hello, Nick.
(laughs)
That took you, like, 20 minutes.
"Hello, Nick."
And now I'm a model and a bartender.
But I...
I'm not sure what's next. I feel a little lost.
I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with my life.
I'm so sorry.
What was your question again?
I didn't ask you anything.
You just walked up and started talking.
So, man, I'm in the locker room, and I see a spider, and I'm like, "I hope this is Charlotte's Web and you're nice."
You haven't seen Charlotte's Web?
Charlotte's Web, the, uh, cartoon.
The tale about the spider who was super chill and super cool.
Then, well, series of events, she ended up dying.
So that was sad.
That was sad, but spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.
I'm sure you... You haven't seen it.
Where are my dogs?
I took the liberty of writing down some exit lines, because obviously, you can't come up with any on your own.
Here, take a look at those.
I've got hockey practice?
Sure.
My boss is trying to contact me about a project that could save the company.
Mm-hmm.
Schmidt, these are such obvious rejections.
I don't want to hurt their feelings.
Hurt their feel...
Do you just walk around all day thinking about other people's feelings?
Yeah. Don't you?
No.
How do you get anything done?
It's hard.
Okay, Jess, how can I put this?
You're the prize here.
Okay?
You are the last piece of pie, and all of these guys are the fat kids in the cafeteria, and I can say that because I used to be fat as a truck.
You really think I'm the last piece of pie?
Damn right you're the last piece of pie.
You're the best girl on Dice, Jess.
And who cares what these guys are feeling?
You know, what do you feel?
Jess, what do you want?
I'm the pie.
You're the pie. I'm the pie.
Say it again.
I'm the pie.
Say it again.
I'm the pie.
There you go.
Who are you?
Never really thought about that.
Mmm.
I'm not gay, but I would go crazy on Michael Strahan.
A prominent U.S. senator is trying to contact me.
You know, I just think Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.
An important document has gone missing.
I need to find it.
I've been getting into a lot of fist fights lately.
Like, a lot.
More than usual.
But, you know, I'm kind of enjoying them now.
I have an acquaintance who's in jeopardy.
Jess?
Nope, not Jess.
Velcro shoes, pervert.
I didn't even see those.
I would love for you to share... share... what you think I should do with my life.
Am I boring you now?
Officer, can I read you your rights?
You have the right to remain hugged.
(laughter)
Oh, no, Coach!
And you have the right to remain sweet.
(laughter)
Run! Diversion!
Run! Run! Now! Now! Uh, du...? Whoa. Hold on!
What's with your friends, Winston Bishop?
They kicked over the grill, and then they ran that way.
Yeah... I know.
Wow. Last date.
It's a big moment.
Oh, my God, is that who I think it is?
I give you Dreamy Eyes Jacob.
Happy Dice birthday, Jess.
You're ready for this. Now, go get him.
Thank you, sir.
JESS: Wait a minute.
Are you from Portland?
The Jolly Cow Creamery.
Yeah, I used to work there summers in high school.
No way. I'm from Portland, too.
Are you serious?
Yes. I used to go there all the time in high school.
Oh, my God.
That's so funny.
(laughter)
Yeah, I hope you like this place.
I live, like, right across the street, so...
Oh. (clears throat) I get it.
You asked me here because -you want me to go home with you.
Wait. What?
No. Um, you know what? I got to go.
I have hockey practice.
I'm center wing, so they really need me. I... Wow.
Okay, I just live across the street.
I'm not some weirdo trying to lure you back to my apartment.
I thought we were kind of hitting it off.
Guess you just make a snap decision, and then that's it, so...
All right, well, have a good practice.
And by the way, there's no center wing in hockey.
The Dice Diez!
You did it!
This thing is on!
How do you open it?
Oh, wow. This isn't even champagne.
Look, it's a super fancy salad dressing.
That is delightful.
We're celebrating... Me and you. Jess, you can have whatever you want on the menu. They got pizza, gelato, Tikka Masala.
A raw bar. This place is doing too much.
They can't be doing all this right. What's wrong with you?
I just don't understand how what we did today is gonna help me find love.
Love?
Well, why would you want to fall in love?
Why else would I go on dates?
The point of dating is just to keep on dating, and then never stop.
It's like burning fossil fuels or seeing a therapist.
No. Schmidt, the whole point of going on dates is to fall in love and have a relationship.
Like, don't you ever worry that you're missing out?
I mean, you're plowing through all these girls, and some of 'em might be great, but you'll never know.
Do you want to go through life that way?
Yeah.
I don't.
Oh, hey, yeah. I'll take the, um... the rock shrimp meatballs.
What is this place?
(shushing)
I think my life is going nowhere.
Oh. Mmm.
No, Cece. It's wonderful here.
Do you like to learn?
I do.
I see you going back to school.
I see it, too.
Yes, yes.
I don't see it.
Yes.
She's a bartender. Why would she get paid for it?
(Cece and Coach hum "Pomp and Circumstance") - She's not very good at it.
(all humming "Pomp and Circumstance")
(beatboxing)
On the floor!
Shut up!
(yelling, overlapping chatter)
(shouting and yelling)
CECE: Get the dog!
Get down on the ground!
Yeah, and stay down!
(indistinct, overlapping chatter)
CECE: I'm a student!
Both of you, butts up.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
(laughter)
See, I see you guys were high, so I got these guys to come and mess with you.
(laughter)
Let's go, man.
Let's never do drugs again.
That was a lot of fun... Toilet.
"Toilet." Is that... is that my nickname?
DUGAN: Yeah, 'cause living with these guys, you got to put up with a lot of crap.
Lot of crap. (laughs)
DUGAN: Let's get a beer.
Thank you very much.
Flush, flush, what's the rush?
Toilet's coming!
You guys want to go back in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming back.
Sure.
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry.
Um, I was... I don't know where to begin.
Uh, my roommate taught me all of these phony excuses to get out of dates.
Well, anyway, that is not me.
Okay.
So... will you give me another chance to get to know you?
Yeah.
Let's go back in and get a drink.
Yes. Great.
Hey, uh, you know, we can just make that last date disappear.
Like... this coin.
(laughing): Oh.
You're a magician.
No. Ugh. No.
I'm a comedy magician.
Even better.
And, like a lot of people in comedy, I have a little problem with, uh... Nose candy.
Uh-oh.
Can't have this. It's my last one.
(laughing): No...
I'm kidding. Take it.
I don't want it.
Please take it.
No, you take it.
Okay. Let's go in.
(quietly): Schmidt?
I totally didn't think I'd ever hear from you again.
Well, you know, I just figured, why not see if there's something here?
You know, let's hang out, get to know each other.
There's a coffee place down the street.
Maybe we could go... Grab a cup of joe.
I don't think you understand Dice.
Okay.
(door closes)
SCHMIDT: Jessica!
I'm late to officiate a giant's wedding, and these are stuck.
(Jacob giggles)
Now the rings are free, but the groom is imprisoned forever.
I know how he feels.
You know what they say.
You got to cr*ck a few eggs to, uh... make an Amish.
It's an egg.
It's an Amish person.
My uncle is on f*re.
So, you've seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat, but have you ever seen a hat pulled out of a rabbit?
No, no!
Oh, my... Okay, this date is over.
I can't. I can't do it.
Oh, of course you can and you will.
Okay, Schmidt, we've been to 11 weddings in a row.
That's too many weddings.
I can't even get into the fridge anymore.
Aah!
I'm so hungry.
Why does everybody get to have a party for everything in their life?
Why can't I have a party for really dedicating myself to knitting this summer?
God, I hate that you knit. I hate everything about it.
Why?
It makes me angry and scared all at the same time.
Just like when I hear the phrase, "Academy Award winner Anna Paquin."
Jessica, you are going to this wedding.
Well... well...
And I'm gonna tell you why: Sexual intercourse.
Do you remember that?
You got to get back out there, Jess.
The last mouth that you kissed was Nick's mouth.
That was four months ago.
Think about that. That's horrible.
Hey. Is Schmidt making fun of me?
Yes.
Hi, Nick.
Okay, cool. Just checking.
Are you wearing tap shoes?
I got 'em at the goodwill. I thought they were just really shiny dress shoes.
(Clicking)
They're cool.
Coach: Hey, what do you guys think about this belt? Like for a wedding gift?
Nick, Coach, get in here.
Everybody in here.
Are we a man down?
I feel like there's one more of us.
Something's going on in Jess' room?!
I'm coming!
(Moans)
Just wait for me.
He's sore from police academy.
I'm sore from police academy!
Okay, we have gone to wedding after wedding this summer, and, with the exception of Coach and myself, none of us have truly taken advantage of the sexual opportunities that a wedding provides.
Jess: Not true.
Wedding number seven, an unneutered dog ran after me, so...
(Scoffs)
I made out with a bridesmaid.
Jess: You did?
Yes.
She was wearing a hospital bracelet and carrying a d*ad goldfish in a bag.
(Snorts) She was still a bridesmaid.
Coach: She looked like the snowman from Frozen.
Hey, aim for the middle.
The ride's rough at first, but the body adjusts.
(Thud, clattering)
I'm all right! I just rolled off the couch.
Winston, please!
I can't close my ass!
We are hooking up tonight, all five of us, including the gimp.
This is the last wedding of summer, which means it is our last chance.
Nobody meets anybody in fall...
No.
Or winter. What, are you gonna gamble on the unknown contents of a bulky sweater?
Not me.
Do you realize how important this is?
I do.
Winter... is coming.
No one comes home alone.
You know what, yeah.
Yeah, I'm in.
She's in. We're all in.
Yeah.
Yes.
I'm in.
I can't hear what's going on, but I'm in.
All five of us out there together, in the wild, getting some strange, like a sex fist.
I'm sorry, what?
Mm, that's not what you mean.
What's a sex fist, now?
One, two, three, four, five of us, together, make a fist.
You're making a mistake right now.
Schmidt, Nick, Coach, Winston, Jess... sex fist.
When you put them all together, Nick: No, that's not right. tearing our way through the reception.
Slow down.
Are you listening to what you're saying?
Isn't that sweet? It's a metaphor for togetherness.
It could just be a fist.
All five of us sex-fisting our way...
S04E01
The Last Wedding
Hi, everybody. Uh, I'm Ted. I'm, uh...
I'm Mark's best friend and his best man.
I-I've known mark since he was in diapers, you know?
Uh, and, by that, I mean junior year of college.
(Laughter)
Ah, what about him, Jess?
What? The best man?
Best man.
Get real, you clown.
I've been out of the game too long.
He's a wedding celebrity.
Everybody say hi to Nana.
How great does Nana look, everybody?
Give it up for Nana.
Six months sober.
(Laughter)
I'm kidding. Three months.
(Laughter)
Jess, come on. Get in there.
What?
You got this.
Think so?
Yes, you got the bangs parted.
You're looking good.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Stick your boobs out. Gotta turn the headlights on.
Ew! Schmidt.
But you got it.
Sex fist.
All right.
Hi.
Hi to you.
(Chuckles)
I'm Coach.
Oh, my God.
You don't remember me?
Yeah...
Yeah, I remember... (Yells)
Ooh... Ooh...
I'm good.
It's the end of the wedding season.
We've got some repeats.
Oh, God. What is she doing here?
I thought she was in Australia.
How do I look?
How-how Jewish?
I mean, like, good Jewish or bad Jewish?
Oh, I won't say... it feels like a trap.
Come on. Come with me.
I haven't told the guys that you broke up with Buster yet, 'cause, um...
I feel like I might have to tell Schmidt outside a hospital, like, you know, when you give a baby peanut butter for the first time?
Yeah.
You're not doing this tonight.
What?
You're not doing this tonight.
I'm not listening to you.
You're not doing this tonight.
I'm picturing CeCe naked.
Stop doing this!
CeCe has a boyfriend, and your obsession with her is not good for you, man.
She's been away all summer, and you have been k*lling it!
Mostly hand stuff.
Who had sex with a bridesmaid on a 45-minute flight to San Jose?
Me.
You were boarding group "d."
She was "b." How's that even possible?
Gotta think outside of the box, my man.
Now get your little white butt back out there and finish the summer of sex that you started.
That's what I'm talking about.
CeCe gone.
See that bridesmaid right there?
The pretty one?
Schmidt: Sure do.
The foxy lady?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you're going home with her tonight.
And I got your back.
Look at that.
She looks like the girl from the commercial playing tennis with a tampon in.
Let's do it.
Hi. I'm Jess.
Hi. I'm Ted.
Cheers.
Cheers.
So you're from Wisconsin... (Voice squeaks)
(Clears throat)
(Coughs)
I'm sorry. Is this thing on?
You're making your throat like a microphone.
Yeah. (Goofy, raspy cough)
That's funny!
Thank you.
Yeah.
Woman: I loved your speech.
Oh.
Hi. I'm Kat.
Hi.
I'm Ted.
Kat: Really nice to meet you.
Yeah. Oh.
Excuse me.
My girlfriend's getting jealous.
Kat: Perfect specimen.
Ted is the only eligible guy here, and we are his two best options for procreation.
Oh.
I'm not trying to intimidate you, I just want you to know who you're dealing with if we're both gonna compete for this man tonight.
What?
Here are the facts: I am technically a genius, I have a photographic memory and I lost my virginity to Malcolm Gladwell.
Okay...
Have you ever heard of plutoxic syndrome?
That's because I cured it.
You're welcome, vaginas everywhere.
(Goofy voice): Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sorry, that was...
vag*na voice, and a...
It was a huge mistake.
I stay current on sporting events.
I watch 30 minutes of p*rn every night just to stay up to date on the latest sex trends.
In the coming months, I'm predicting a throwback to missionary.
It all depends on what happens in Syria.
Well, have you ever had sex when you were really, really, really, really, really, really tired?
I'm never tired.
I'm the better choice of mate.
From a purely biological standpoint, you're shorter, weaker, and dumber.
No offense. I love those shoes.
I love your shoes.
But I love your shoes.
Your shoes.
No, I love your shoes.
Your shoes.
Your shoes.
(Very quiet): Your shoes.
(Whispering): Your shoes.
(No voice)
What?
I was just moving my mouth.
So you're competing with her?
Jess: I can take her down, because I have something she doesn't have: You guys.
Now, strategies.
What about you, Coach?
You hook up at weddings all the time.
What's your strategy?
It's called being a gorgeous black man with the body of an action figure.
I could give that a try.
(Laughing) Nick: You want to know what your ex-boyfriend thinks you should do to get the guy?
No, I don't. That's super weird.
Yeah, it's too weird, so... Somebody else.
Okay, look, babe, just get out on the dance floor, okay?
Guys think that they way you dance is the way you have sex.
Okay.
So just give them a little something, okay?
You just need to, like, roll your body a little bit.
Something a little sexy.
Pop your hip out a little bit.
Hey, man, I'm not gonna lie to you right now.
I've got a halfie.
Okay, we got to go!
Excuse me, everybody!
I need a minute.
What do you think of this?
Mm... hmm...
Mm-mm.
I'm good to go now.
Let's go!
All right.
Ugh!
I just want to get back out there, but I feel like I forgot everything I knew.
Do you guys still like an Oakland face with an L.A. booty?
Would you like to know my strategy, Jess?
Is the art of seduction really where you shine?
Be there.
(Laughs): That's it?
Yeah. Just be there.
No matter where he goes, be there.
He gets a drink, be there. He talks to his friends, be there.
At the end of the night, be there.
It's called "the Joe Biden."
That's creepy, man.
The basic concept of what he's saying, though, could actually work.
Yeah.
(Quiet laugh)
I'm gonna biden his ass.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah. Yup. That'll do it.
I know.
Oh, hey! Uh, you know, Kat was just telling me about her hairlessness.
Hmm. She's like a seal.
(Laughs) Hmm. That's okay.
You guys talk.
I'm just gonna be here.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Why are you so scared of intimacy?
Who broke your heart and why haven't you forgiven her?
Uh... well... Yeah, the thi...
Huh?
You're arrogant, you're sexist...
You stole my phone charger.
You're conceited. You're a liar.
Aah!
I rented best man holiday.
You're not in it.
So, you know Tom...
Uh, Tom, of course, he wanted to sell shoes for a profit.
And I said, "no."
I said, "you...
You do something better."
You got a... pretty good face.
So, you guys want to come home with us, right?
We want to do a four-way.
Me, her, you and him.
Of course. We'll, uh... Nick?
(Knocks)
Nick?!
Hi. How are you?
Hi. Good. How are you?
Are you enjoying the wedding?
Yeah.
You be... yeah.
Mm!
Hey.
Hey, Nick.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, do you know how they sell ice cream at the drugstore...?
I'm not having a four-way with you... end of discussion.
Come on, Nick. We don't have any other choice.
I've found 15 other girls since I've been here.
They're all either married or taken or mad at Coach.
I'm not doing a four-way with you...
It's the last helicopter out of Saigon, my man.
Charlie won.
No, Schmidt.
You won't even know it's me, Nick.
Look, at this point, it's all skin and shapes...
That's-that's what I'm afraid of.
It-it's the fog of w*r, man.
There's so much stuff going on.
You're just, you're just here.
Yeah...
You don't even know what's happening.
Okay, but I want to know what's happening if it's with sex... I don't want some fog of w*r on top of me, if it looks like you.
That's the point.
The fog of w*r is something you can't see through.
Like, the whole thing with the Charlie thing and Vietnam, I don't know who I'm fighting!
I'm soft like a lady. You won't even know.
But what if I get a surprise?
"A surprise"?
What if there's a surprise on me?
There's not gonna be a surprise on you.
What if I'm fighting the w*r and boom... there's a surprise!
You go north, I go south.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I'll be in steerage and I'm rowing.
And I'm rowing and I'm rowing and the...
You're up in the crow's nest.
Fre-fresh air up there, man.
And I'm in the trenches, you know?
I'm digging for coal.
I'm breathing in those fumes.
And you're up here. You're just taking in the sights. You're spotting dolphins, huh?
You're just the handsome prince covered in salty sea spray...
I don't want you calling me handsome before a potential four-way!
This...
Nick, please!
I'm begging you for this.
CeCe is here.
And I can't get her out of my head.
Don't, don't, don't play the CeCe card right now, don't do...
I'm gonna play the CeCe card, okay?
Look, she's here and I don't want to go home alone.
(Groans) I need your help, please.
(Grunts loudly)
What's up, guys?
Tell you what. I am so sore I can't have sex with nobody tonight.
Only thing I want in my mouth is Mr. and Mrs. I.B. Profen.
(Laughs) Minus the mister.
My man... Winston, I got a question for you.
Do you think that, that two men can engage in group sex without... without compromising their friendship.
Good question, good question.
Um... okay.
Uh, let's just say Nick is the salt.
And, Schmidt, you are the pepper.
I'm assuming we're talking about you two.
Hypothetically, I suppose.
Whatever. Yes.
Hypothetically, all right. Not necessarily.
Actually I'm gonna need some...
Ooh, boy.
Seems as if I've made a mess.
Got to clean that up.
Yes, look at that.
Salt all in the pepper.
Pepper all in the salt.
Just mixed up like that.
Is there salt shoved in the pepper hole?
How'd it get in there? How did salt get shoved into this tiny, tiny pepper hole?
Nick?
You're terrible at demonstrations!
Oh, uh...
You know, I-I'm just gonna, uh...
Yeah, Ted. Get crazy.
Leave it all out there on the field.
Okay. (Claps hands)
I'll come back with stories. (Chuckles)
(Both laugh)
Are you bidening?
What? No.
(Whispers): How did you know about that?
Because I'm always gonna be one step ahead of you.
Extreme biden!
(Whispering): Kat.
(Grunts with effort)
Kat, Kat... let me out.
This was a huge mistake.
I'm sorry. I'm not proud of this.
It smells so bad in here.
(Quiet groan)
Ted: Jess?
Hi.
Jess, th-this is the men's room.
This is where it all happens.
Don't wait for me, Ted, 'cause I might be awhile.
See you out on the dance floor.
And at wedding 12, I sat on a men's toilet.
When did one-on-one sex become old-fashioned?
You know, America's got to take a hard look in the mirror at ourself.
We used to make things.
Just be glad you're not single.
Oh.
Actually Buster and I broke up.
So, anyway...
(Groaning): Oh... no!
No!
That is so terrible!
Didn't know you cared this much.
No, no, no, no...
If you're single...
Mm-hmm. that means that I have to do something.
Something awful.
You have no idea what you just did to me.
You have no idea, young lady!
I'll do the four-way with you.
Yes! Okay, I'm gonna go book the room.
You go to housekeeping, have them give you as many shower caps as they'll give you...
Okay, stop.
They're gonna get one hand and I'm not gonna move it.
I'm just gonna dangle it into the mix while I look at something else on my phone.
And that's the deal.
Aw, man, this is gonna be big for us.
This is for you, buddy.
Thanks.
(Laughs): Yeah!
What the hell is that?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what's-what's that on your hand, man?
Why is it so rough? It's like hoof.
There's nothing on my hand. This is a regular old hand...
I'm out, I'm out. You're out of what?
Four-way. Done. No way.
Not with that thing.
You're a buffoon.
That is ridiculous.
I was only doing it for you, Schmidt, so you don't freak out when you find out that CeCe's single.
And now I'm the weirdo with the hoof hand.
What... take it back from the hoof hand.
What'd you say before? About CeCe being single?
How do you know that?
She's single?
I have my, uh... assumptions.
So CeCe's single now.
You don't know that for sure.
That's interesting.
Why are you so calm?
Interesting.
Don't just say "interesting."
That's interesting.
If you're gonna say "interesting" say why it's interesting.
It is interesting.
(Screams)
Aah!
Nick!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
It's the men's room!
Mmm...
Jess, scooch over. All right.
(Groans)
What are you doing? Just hiding in the bathroom?
Kind of.
(Laughs)
(Laughs) Me, too.
I know I'm supposed to, like, "get back out there," you know? But...
Maybe I'm just not built for it.
Man, I hear you.
Sidebar: What do my hands feel like?
Hooves.
Aw, son of a...
Maybe there's a reason I'm not up on a fridge, you know?
Maybe some people are fridge people, and other people are... toilet people.
You think you're a toilet person?
(Laughing) You're not a toilet person.
You want to get on the fridge, you'll get on the fridge, Jess.
Just be yourself, and if he's not into Jessica Day, then there's something wrong with him.
Be myself.
Like do my Tina Turner impression?
How did your brain jump there?
♪ What's love got to do ♪
♪ got to do with it? ♪
(Laughs)
(Laughs) All right.
I hear your logic.
Come on.
No man wants that, but... you can't quit, either.
You're our last hope.
You're the only one out of the group who might not go home alone tonight, Jess.
Really?
Yes.
It's all on your shoulders.
So the sex fist... has... turned into a sex finger.
Uh, don't... yeah.
Sex finger.
Hey. Ted. Um...
(Clears throat) I'm out of moves, so...
I'm just gonna try being myself.
Here's some stuff about me: I've never cured anything.
I'm a middle school vice principal and I love my job.
Um, I'm just getting out of a relationship with a guy that I still live with, which is kind of complicated.
He's over there.
What's up, Nick?
Hi, I'm Nick!
Sometimes I cry when newscasters wish each other "Happy Birthday" on air.
My first crush was on a Batman cake, but my first sexual feelings were about teenage Simba.
'Cause he was super hot, and I still, actually, find him hot.
Uh, truth time. Um...
So that's me.
And if you want to take me home, Ted, we can definitely do some no-bra stuff.
Uh...
That's me naked.
Well...
...and this is me with a guy who I thought was Larry king.
So it's decision time.
Yeah, Ted, who's it gonna be?
Me or Jess?
(Sighs)
Hmm?
Ted: Ooh...
Ted: Wow. Hah.
Ooh...
This is tough.
I mean, okay, 'cause I mean, over here we've got, you know, the whole... you know.
And then, but of course over here we got the... bing, and the... you know.
Mmm...
(Groaning): Oh, God, what do I do?
What do I do?
It's over.
Moment's passed, Ted.
Okay.
I'll take him out.
So you and Buster broke up.
Whew. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm just waiting for you to do something weird now.
Yeah, I feel that coming on, so, um...
I'm gonna go.
(Sighs heavily)
You know what doesn't whine and cry is the sperm in my freezer.
I am counting down the days until we don't need men to procreate.
If I really put my mind to it...
Autumn 2018.
Are you ready?
Oh, it's my plan "b."
Yeah. Beats going home alone.
Just giving her a ride.
Nothing weird.
(Whispering): We do this every time.
So, Katherine, uh... Where do you live?
About two inches north of your mouth, Padre.
Bye.
Bye.
Schmidt: It's okay, Jess.
Sex fist is obviously over.
We're all going home alone.
Well, that's where you're wrong, Schmidt.
We're not going home alone.
That's great.
All right.
It's like that.
"Regan, Kevin and Rebecca..."
(Laughing)
"...request the honor of your presence."
How about the honor of my garbage can?
Coach: Hey!
Jess: Those fridge people with their stupid houses...
Oh, look at this one, guys.
Uh, it looks like Jeffrey and Lauren want us to share in their joy.
How about they share in my chocolate pocket?
(Laughing): What does that mean?
In my butt.
Mm-mm.
Jess: That's gross.
Yeah, I...
(Laughing)
Oh, man... how about this one, you guys?
Scott and Derek.
Yeah, real tasteful wedding... for a Thursday!
Nick: Yeah.
Oh, look at that... Laurie and Mitchell.
They had a cash bar.
I hope they can't have kids!
That's super dark, bro.
That was too far. I hope they can...
Yeah!
...I hope they can, I hope they can.
CeCe and Shivrang... You bastards, take that one down.
You know what? It's gone.
(Whoops) No...
Nick: Take that one down!
Oh, yeah.
Jess: Wait a minute.
Who are Gabe and Stephanie, with the profile, these things?
Oh, Gabe's the heavy guy with the perm and the wheelchaiair...
No, Gabe was the guy on the motorcycle...
No, no, no, no. The guy with the perm.
The guy who kept showing his stomach the whole time.
Oh. Schmidt: That's the woman who was eight and a half months pregnant.
The groom was dressed as the bride...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, uh...
This wedding's next week.
What?
What?
(All muttering)
Not anymore.
(Whooping, cheering)
Whoa!
(All laughing)
That's right! Come on, now!
Ripping it up!
(Everyone talking at once)
Oh! Oh! Look at that one.
Rippin' 'em up.
(Whoops)
Rip. Oh, right there.
Yes.
Mmm...
(Laughing) More to rip.
Guys, we're going on a cruise and you guys are coming with us. And none of you have a choice.
(Laughs) A cruise? If I wanted to watch a heavy-set guy in sandals eating with his hands, I would've just posted up and watched Nick in the kitchen.
When we were together, we booked a cruise.
We tried to get our money back, but it's Both: Nonrefundable.
Yeah.
(Laughs) They made that very clear.
Seemed like a safe bet at the time.
I don't want a refund on my cruises and I don't want a refund on you.
We're never gonna die! - Nick: Yeah! - Y'all nasty.
Ah-ha-ha, yeah! Where you going? - Yes! - What are you doing now? Oh, there she goes (Laughs) Turns out, I do want a refund On you.
Give me my money back! Jess: Anyway, they let us downgrade our "lovers' suite" to include four more people.
And that's you guys.
I have some concerns about going on a cruise with two people that just broke up.
Absolutely.
Me, too.
Yeah, I have the same concern as Winnie.
Like, I don't want to go.
I have strong qualms as well.
He got qualms.
Put those qualms away.
Yeah.
It's gonna be fine, okay? - Totally.
We are k*lling this breakup, honestly.
But we're gonna be on a ship in the middle of the ocean with no escape.
What if you guys get in a big fight and we're stuck out there with you? It'll be like a floating, all-you-can-eat prison.
I promise you no weirdness.
Guess that's an excuse to go out and buy a new bikini.
Which could be good.
I'm in.
Full steam ahead! We have two on board! Nope! Let's not do, uh, nautical puns, please.
If we're gonna do nautical puns, we shouldn't We shouldn't go.
That's fair, and I won't.
I'm in, too.
Uh, I have an idea.
Just throwing this out there.
What if we do the cruise on the ground? - Like, on land.
That's silly.
What, are you scared of boats or something? Afraid me, afraid of boats? You're afraid of boats, dude.
Cece: Ha! He's scared of boats? (Laughs) Hold on, hold on.
Oh, my God, you're scared of boats.
Dude! Is it the boats or the water? Can you swim? Yeah.
You feel safe now? I'm not I don't need to be safe, man.
I'm brave! I take dumps standing up! I'm a man! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
Schmidt, do you got any Fisherman's pants I can borrow? What's that? It's a class ring for Cece.
She got her ged and I've been tutoring her, so I had this made.
What? Shame, shame, I know your name Please don't "shame, shame" me, Winston.
(Singsongy): You're still in love with her.
I am not still in love with her, okay? You're alone on a boat with Cece, romantic cruise, and you give her jewelry.
Then what? I tell her that I'm still in love with her and that I want her back, and then we have sex until the boat sinks.
I knew it, I knew it! To the bottom of the ocean.
To the bottom of the ocean.
Oh, man the sand and the mackerel and the chum and whatever the hell else is down there.
And crabs.
Not the crabs.
Yeah.
Don't tell anyone.
I'm serious, Winston.
Do not tell anyone.
What are you doing? You are so weird.
Can you ever just leave the room like a normal person? All (Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Yeah! Coach: A little tight.
With the amount of stuff we're gonna be doing, we're barely gonna be in the room.
(Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Both: Cruise! Cruise.
Cruise Welcome aboard the Wave Dancer, your home for the next five days.
I am your captain, Jan Nortis, and I invite you to dance on the waves with me.
(Cheering) Cruise! Cruise! (Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cru I'm gonna get drunk! Sorry.
Enthusiasm! I like these people.
Friendship is the most crucial ingredient to any sea adventure.
Second only to buoyancy.
Because a ship has to float.
Ah! Oh, okay.
(Laughing) I didn't know where you was going with it.
Nick: We love you, captain! Whoo-hoo! Everybody, my name is Doug.
Hi, Doug.
Hi, Doug.
Hey, Doug.
I'm Winston.
Does anyone know what to do in case of an emergency? Uh-oh.
It looks like we're all in the same boat.
(Laughing politely) Excuse me.
If we could just continue on without any more nautical puns, that'd be great.
Feels like that's just the lowest form of humor.
Looks like I found a grumpy Gus! - I'm sorry, a what? - Doug: Boo! - All: Boo - Doug: Boo and hiss! Boo.
Folks, if you see Gus frowning around, brighten up his day by giving him a tickle.
A what? - Tickle.
Quit it! Enough! - Tickle.
Tickles I don't like to be tickled, you guys.
Tickle, tickle - All right! Enough! We have fun! (Chuckles) But the ocean does not.
What? Listen to what I have to say if you don't want to die.
Don't worry, Coach.
Everyone who works on a cruise ship is a performer.
They're just doing a show.
So what? What are you talking to me about it for? - I'm not scared.
I just thought you should know.
You're definitely scared.
Sure.
I'm not scared, dude.
What are you talking about? - Yeah, no, of course.
I'm not scared.
You'll live.
It's okay.
Okay, now I need a volunteer to help me with some emergency procedures.
I'll do it.
I don't care.
'Cause I'm not scared.
I'll volunteer my ass off.
(Laughs) I ain't afraid of you! (Laughs) - Let's say it's 3:00 A.
M.
3:00 A.
M.
There's alarms going off - What? freezing seawater up to your ankles.
Adults are screaming, babies are crying! Go, go, go, go, go! You're up on deck! There's an Italian guy strapping chains together! - You don't know what's going on! - I know! - What do you do? - I don't know! What do I do? - What do you do? What do you do? - I-I get, I get in the boat? - You get in the boat! - I get in the boat! You're getting in the boat! - I get in the boat! - Wrong! Wrong! No! The first thing you do is you what? Make sure your life preserver is strapped on correctly.
No, no, screw that, man! I'm gettin' in the boat! Get out of my way! - I'm getting in the boat! - Where you going, Coach? He's paddling to heaven, 'cause he's already d*ad.
Don't say that! Spread your wings, little angel.
Douglas that's a little too much.
Oh, my God! Stroke! Stroke! - Ah, there's two of these! - Okay all righty.
How do you do two of these? - Okay - You're safe.
You're okay.
Stroke! Stroke! (Gasps) You're okay! You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.
(Gasping, sobbing) Shh.
Amazing grace I'm not afraid of boats.
How sweet No one's afraid.
(Sobs) The sound Okay, I'm good.
I'm good, I'm good.
You okay? (Screaming) Thank you.
Thank you all for coming to the To the seminar.
Remember to sign up for the volleyball tournament.
Hey, Coach? You okay, buddy? You okay, pal? Nah, you guys, I'm fine.
I'm just gonna I'm gonna hang out in the room for a little bit, okay? - See you later.
Later.
Cruise! Cruise.
Cruise What should we do first? Cheer up, grumpy Gus! All right! Cut your fingernails, man! Ha ha! Nice! With this tickling.
(Laughs) Hey, hey, hey, guys.
The captain's coming.
Nick: It's the captain.
Winston: What's up, captain? Nortis: Hello, again.
I'm captain Jan Nortis, as I previously stated.
I would just like to say that I am a fan of your enthusiasm.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Please don't do that.
Sorry.
I may be a captain, but first and foremost, I am a woman.
Absolutely.
Come on! Did anyone just see that she was flirting like crazy with Nick? That was, like, the most shameless flirting I've ever seen.
"Keep it in your pants" is all I have to say to captain Jan Nortis.
You're being really weird.
You're being weird.
Super weird right now.
Here we go.
This is starting now already.
I am not being weird.
You're creating an awkward situation for no reason.
Don't do this, Jess.
If this ship moves as fast as that captain, we'll be in ensenada by 6:00.
Well, she was flirting with you.
Which I'm okay with, because she is a handsome woman.
Jess, stop.
You're being weird.
No, I'm not being weird.
I'm not being weird! I am, I am being weird.
Okay, focus up for a second.
Okay, they say this is an all-inclusive trip, but you know what that means.
But from their eyes, you have a couple of drinks, and then you're done.
And then what have you paid for? We're smarter than that, okay? We are.
We're gonna take every class, we're gonna do every activity.
We're gonna get our money's worth.
Okay.
Got it? - Yeah.
Uh, Jessica Day and Nick Miller.
All right, Day-Miller party.
Here is your itinerary for the grand romance package.
No! No! Yeah, we're looking for something more like PG-13.
What do you have? Do you have, like, a friendship package or? What package would you recommend for two brothers looking for trouble? The grand romance package is nonrefundable.
Well, we're not doing that, so we're good.
Are you sure? This includes over $600 of activities and - We're gonna do it.
We're not doing it.
$600? That is 600 one-dollar bills.
That's the only way I can imagine it.
We can do this.
Okay.
Yeah.
We're gonna get our money's worth.
We are the best ex-couple in the whole world.
Yeah, we are.
Yes.
Okay? You guys are exes? Yeah, you're not gonna want to do this.
We're doing it.
Give us the folder.
(Sighs) - I just wanted to say - Grumpy Gus! No! No! No! - Grumpy Gus.
Sweet mother of sea dragon! What? What happened? I just witnessed a dolphin being cut straight in half by our keel.
It's a ghastly sight.
What? That's horrible! Terrible.
It's a shame about the dolphin, man.
Really is.
What?! As your bodies become one, follow your breath through your spine to the soles of your feet and into your genitals.
What? (Laughs) Into my genitals? Yeah.
(Laughs) Breathe into your genitals I'm not breathing into my genitals, lady.
All right, lovers, let's get sexy.
Give me your sexiest pose right here.
This is it.
This is it.
Sexiest pose.
That's not it's not romantic in any way.
Think about the first time you kissed.
How was it? If you can move in.
Come back in.
Come back in.
Wow, I've never done a couples massage on exes before.
In case you're wondering what that scar on his back is, it's from falling on a fence when he was six.
I was legally d*ad for ten minutes.
We're going to make all the towel animals you guys find in your rooms every single night! - We made laundry.
Nice.
We're always happy Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy We're just totally different people.
Yeah, we just don't belong together.
(Both laugh) You're really bumming me out.
Hey, Jess, is this doing weird stuff to your eyes? Definitely.
Give me five, man! Leaving me hanging! (Laughs) You know what? You were right.
This isn't weird at all.
No, it isn't.
Are they out of rosÃ©? You know what? This is an old bartending trick, Jess.
Put your glass out.
You go like this No way.
Look at that.
You got some rosÃ©.
You're a genius.
I think I'm smarter at sea.
(Both laugh) You look, you look like you belong here.
What's that, on a ship? Yeah, you, too.
(Both laugh) Oh, yo! Yo! Yo-yo-yo! Yo, pal.
Yo.
Well, that was a mistake.
Yes, it was! That was not on purpose.
My fault, too.
Yep.
Yeah, it was We can't do the grand romance package anymore.
I agree.
We should - No.
It's too much.
It's too intense.
They whip you into this sexual frenzy.
I know.
It's weird.
I just feel like Yeah, 'cause everything's fine.
You know, I feel like a cruise tonight.
It's not, like, a really big deal.
I feel like We're good.
Everything's good.
Yeah, no problem, no problem.
All right, bye, dude.
Bye.
Jess, I've been looking all over for you.
I was hoping that as a group, we could do a little night fishing that I already put a deposit down on, so we're going.
And if we don't catch anything, they'll let us sh**t a machine g*n directly into the water.
That is international waters for you, baby.
I would really love nothing more than to go out there and sh**t a bunch of fish in the face with you, but I think that's more of a Nick thing.
And yesterday, we decided it would be better for everyone if we just spent the rest of the time apart.
What? I'm really sorry.
I wanted this to be a great vacation for you guys.
But look, we split up the ship: I took starboard, he took the other one.
I got the starboard and she got the other side.
What are you doing, man? You're hanging out by an exhaust vent.
It keeps the left side of my face warm and it sounds like the ocean.
More than the ocean sounds like the ocean? Come on, Nick.
You guys can't be separate the whole trip.
The trip just made it clear.
The breakup's too hard.
I don't think we can be friends for a while.
What? You're not gonna be friends with Jess? And even you guys said it.
It's just too weird.
Nick, man, that's like the president and the vice president not being best friends.
They're not best friends.
Come on.
Everybody knows they're best friends.
They work together, but they're not best friends.
Dude, they're the president and the vice president.
Okay.
I mean, is this something you're okay with? No, I'm not okay, but what am I gonna do? Well I mean, look, man, we all have to be together on this trip.
That's why we came here.
Nick, there's gotta be something I can do.
Yeah, you know what you can do? Yeah, anything, come on.
You can cash in my skee ball tickets on the other side of the boat.
Get me one of those toy spiders that I was talking to you about before.
And if they're out - All right, man, all right.
then grab me a bunch of erasers? The opportunity has not presented itself as I'd hoped it would, so I'm creating it now.
When I say, "May our progeny bathe in the infinite glow," that's your cue.
Now, what what did I just say? You repeat it so I know that you know the cue.
May our pro what? What's wrong with you? Unbelievable.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'll just say, "go," okay? When I say, "go," you start to play.
And before she sees, just get behind get behind the vent.
Get behind the vent.
(Clears throat) Cece Hmm? Hey.
Um, your hair in the moonlight It looks so shiny.
You know, I'm trying to get a signal so I can talk to Buster, but it's just impossible out here.
In the moonlight, your eyes, they sparkle like, like fish eyes.
I got one.
Now, like, what, do I have to hold it at this angle the whole time? Why is it so important for you to get in touch with Buster? (Sighs) Look, you know better than anyone that I don't have the best of luck with relationships.
And I know you think he's young for me.
I don't.
I just want you to be happy.
Thank you.
Winston: Guys, guys! You got to come with me right now.
Be warned, though.
There is a weird guy with a violin hiding behind this vent.
A what? Dude! (Groans) - What's going on? - Come on right.
I will I will knock you out where you stand, sir.
Get back there.
They're gonna take a break from being friends for a while? What does that even mean? Guys, this is on us.
We're the ones who put the pressure on them to not be weird.
I know.
What were we thinking? Of course they're gonna be weird.
They just broke up.
Hey, that's on y'all.
I-I have nothing to do with that.
I've just been chilling in the room.
Hanging out, singing songs.
You are safe in the room You are safe, you will live I've been trying to get them to talk to each other all morning, okay? (Humming) I passed up on breakfast pizza and singles bingo.
And those bingo chicks? Oh, they put out.
Bingo! They're not gonna listen to us.
(Quietly): Don't-don't ever do that again.
The bingo thing? That's what they It's funny, that's what they say when I You know who they will listen to, though? - A doctor.
The president! - The ca What were you - What were you gonna say? - The captain.
The captain.
(Over p.
A.
): Attention, this is your captain.
Would Nick Miller and Jessica Day please return to their stateroom for a non-life-thr*at but necessary official maritime reason.
This is not an emergency.
It is definitely not.
Hey! Did you hear the captain? Yes! Go, go, go! (All clamoring) Everybody inside! This is not a drill! Okay! Okay, the door is locked.
The "Do not disturb" sign has been employed.
We are not leaving here until you guys are friends again.
We just wanted to spend our vacation alone.
Yes.
On separate strange parts of this ship.
Yeah, it's I really wanted to see how the ship worked.
I think it's interesting.
And I really wanted to see how the other side of the ship worked.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
We should've never asked you guys not to be weird around us.
Mm-hmm.
We-we want you to be weird around us.
Yeah.
Just let us in.
Open your cellar doors, and let us taste your jams.
You want to "taste our jams"? - Again, you have lost me.
Listen to yourself for once in your life.
Jess: It's my jam and you can't have it.
First of all, that's my ex-girlfriend's jam, dude.
I put a ban on jam.
Okay, you know what? All of us are weird.
But we're all still friends.
So, let's talk about it.
I'll go first.
I've made out with half of the guys in this room.
Okay.
That's a start.
All right.
That's a start.
And I have had nightmares about making out with the other two guys in this room.
So, yourself? - And me.
Nick and Winston.
Cece: Okay.
Okay.
It's good for you to finally admit that.
I respect that.
Yeah, thanks for sharing.
Um, it really bums me out that I'll never know the infinite joy of what it feels like to carry a child inside of me.
Wow.
Okay, Coach! That's honesty.
That's real honest.
That's how it's done.
Okay, um Here we go, up we go.
I feel like it is really weird that I live with my ex-boyfriend.
See? There you go! - Nice! Just turn on the tap.
You know, let it out.
Really nice.
That was cool that you admitted that.
I feel weird about living with my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
You know, I think it's a landmine for trouble.
What's gonna happen when other hunks come around? What's gonna happen when you bring some ho-bag in the house? Exactly! Like, that it's scary stuff, and I feel like when a breakup happens, you mostly get away.
'Cause I'm gonna b*at her ass.
What if she's bigger than you? She probably will be.
(Laughs): Oh, snap! That was good.
(All laughing) Good for you! Yeah! I saw that, man.
That's how it all starts.
This is how it starts.
Good.
That's good, man, that's really good.
Yeah.
Well, it's nice to talk to you about this.
Yeah, it was really weird when you Tried to kiss me last night, (Groans) And you licked my ear.
What?! What?! - You guys kissed last night? - This is so confusing! - What?! It was just a lapse.
We were drunk.
You guys are getting back together? We're not getting back together.
You're confusing everybody! No, it was the grand romance package.
My God! They were, like, folding these towels.
It was so sexy.
You try folding towels like that and see if you don't get turned on.
Yeah, because they fold the towels like vaginas.
They're swans, dude.
And the yoga instructor was, like, breathing into our genitals, and, like It opened everyone up.
(Clicks tongue) Yeah.
In a real true way.
Absolutely.
This thing was ready to talk to that thing again.
Emotionally and sexually.
Yeah.
What?! What?! - What's wrong with you, man? - Are you crazy? - Schmidt: Just pick one either You're together or you're not! (All clamoring) Winston: Gonna punch you in the face, bro! Things are really weird.
Agreed.
But I'm okay with it.
Me, too.
Hey, there.
Aw! What? All right, okay.
Good enough, good start.
Wonderful.
Thank you for doing this weird intervention thing.
This was pretty great.
Yeah, it worked out.
I think everybody's good now.
Let's go eat our weight in fake crab.
There you go.
Absolutely.
There we go.
Great idea.
I'm gonna get drunk.
Winston: I gotta get psyched up.
Gotta get psyched up.
The door's stuck.
Is that part of your thing? No.
Well, call security.
I got rid of the room phone.
I-I thought it was gonna be got rid of the phone? - More intense than this, I-I'm sorry! - You m*rder us! - Open up! Open up! - What? No.
Watch out.
You know what? It's just, it's usually the handle.
Just, like, get the handle - I'll do it, I'll do it! I got it.
All right, move.
I got it.
Guys, guys, guys! Okay, here we go.
Calm down.
How long could it take for someone to hear us? Oh.
(Flies buzzing) We did bad things to the tub.
(Speaks in Spanish) I got the sugars.
I'm the sugar man.
(Laughs) Silence! I have the talking soap! (Crying) Oh! I'm the queen of Wednesday! It's so nice to have a family portrait.
We should shower less.
I think we look really great.
I'm really glad we framed this.
I mean, what a proud moment.
It is cool being in the paper, though.
(Laughs) Part of me d*ed on that boat.
(Laughs): Oh.
I will never be the same again.
All right, man.
Take a nap.
Sleep it off, man.
I'm sorry.
Is Cece checking out Schmidt? What?! Let me see that.
Huh? (Laughs) What are you talking about, Winston? Winston (Singsongy): Shame, shame, I know your name.
You do not know my name, Winston.
Winston: Cece got a boyfriend who used to be Betty! Cece: Yeah, you better run, bitch.
Winston: Ow! Ow! Ow! That's my mustache! (Sighs) You know, I've been thinking a lot - about your sleeping arrangements and - Weird.
I might have an idea on how to make things a little bit less weird.
Really? What is it? Two words.
Bunk beds.
No.
(Laughs) No, I'm not putting bunk beds in my room, Schmidt.
Not in your room.
In my room.
It'll be just like college, my man.
Only with way more sex.
What? - That came out wrong.
I'm not bunking with you, Schmidt.
(Laughs) Yeah, he is.
Yeah, he is.
Yeah, he is.
There's gonna be a lot of rules, - and I'm gonna make most of them.
You can make them all, man! Except for the ones that I make! (Both laugh) Schmidt: First one in gets dibs!
Thanks for helping me with my school dance.
"Love is forever, and ever, and ever, and" - How many "and ever"s? - Technically infinity, but I could only fit 12.
Well, this is going to be tough for you, huh? Yes! Foster said we couldn't afford it, but I really stuck my neck out for this dance.
No, I-I mean because the theme of the dance is "Love is forever" and Nick, and the breakup What? No, Cece, look, you remember what school dances were like for me.
They were miserable.
I was just waiting in the bathroom for to magically appear and ask me out.
I remember.
I was smoking in the stall next to you.
We get it, you were bad.
I just don't want it to be like it was for me.
I want them to have an incredible time.
My life is a bit of a mess right now, but the one thing I can do is throw an amazing dance for them.
"Love is forever, and ever, and ever" - What is this? - The theme of Jess's school dance.
It's pretty ironic, huh? - Jess, you poor thing.
Come-come here.
Come here.
What? What? Just there.
What are you doing? - All right.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Oh, I know.
I know.
I know.
What's happening? I got hug number two locked and loaded.
Soft or hard, it's up to you.
I know.
Schmidt Ay-ay-ay, I needed a shvitz.
Ech, me, too.
My arms are so sore from doing so many push-ups.
That seems like a lie.
No, I'm trying to stay fit after the breakup.
I've been eating salads, yeah, no dressing, - mostly just the protein.
What kind of salad you've been eating? - The little chopped of pieces of ham.
Just the ham? - Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
I don't like the lettuce.
I think it's gross to eat stuff on earth that's green.
Well, look, you know baby steps - Not baby steps, - there were some pretty big pieces of ham.
Okay.
It's still not as good.
I genuinely miss goofing around with Jess.
Breakups aren't supposed to be easy, so Well, it's really mature of you, man.
We're doing something where we are we are not allowed to be in the room alone together without Winston.
'Cause he just naturally takes the sexual tension out of a room.
What'd you guys want? You see? I'm proud of you.
That's what I'm talking about.
We're men.
We've felt pain, we've survived it.
Look at me.
I'm watching Cece drool over some 20-year-old.
How could she be interested in a boy when she could have these ripe berries? Look at these, Nick.
Put your towel down.
Oh, God, I need a shvitz.
Why does my sweat smell like asparagus? He does take all the sexual tension out of a room.
Man, I heat up every room I walk into.
Put me next to a dozen eggs.
They hatching.
You know why? 'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.
There was no sexual tension in here before he got here.
Keep telling yourself that, Nick.
Congrats, chaperones! With your help, tonight is going to be unforgettable.
I didn't sign up for this.
No, you didn't.
None of you did.
In fact, none of you have ever, ever signed up for any school event, ever.
Which means you've never felt the joy of exchanging your free time for a child's smile.
I never volunteer because of my Munchausen syndrome.
Are we getting paid? You will get paid, um, actually, in attractive hats that I made.
They say "chaperone.
" And Gary the Janitor has one that says "clean up crew.
" You call me Gary the Janitor as if me being a janitor is my whole identity.
It's like someone calling you Jess the Third-Hottest White Teacher.
Okay.
Are we done? I'm gonna say we're done.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank-thanks, guys.
Good-good meeting.
I don't know where I'm supposed to be right now.
Thanks, guys.
It's gonna be great! You don't have to wear that, Coach.
As far as I'm concerned, this dance starts now.
I know how important this dance is to you.
Those kids won't get away with anything.
They want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me.
Wait.
If they want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me! Wait.
Hey, Wendy.
Whoa! That shirt's scary! Whoa.
You going to the dance tonight? My mom's making me go.
Making you go to the best night of your life? Your mom sounds really cool.
Come one, at your age, love is forever and ever and ever.
What are you gonna wear? This shirt.
Oh.
Oh! That is the best idea I've heard all week.
Whoa! Scary shirt! We all think that you're an idiot for dating this 14-year-old.
He's 20.
That means he was seven when Good Will Hunting came out.
Seven, Cece.
Good Will Hunting.
You know what? Let me go, let me go, let me go.
Um, check this out.
Cece's boyfriend is so young that It'll come back to me.
Buster is more of a man than all of you.
Okay? He's been to, like, 40 countries, he builds boats, he used to train snakes with his uncle.
Earning a respectable wage, wearing a proper-hanging pair of slacks, ordering sushi like a sick-ass boss - These things a man maketh.
So stupid stuff that you do.
I know that technically you guys are men, but all you do is hang out with each other, like you're 12.
What do you know? You're just a stupid girl.
Okay, I got it, I got it.
Okay, Cece's boyfriend is so young that - How-how young is he? - Winston.
It's not working, man.
I'm serious.
I'm at my wit's end with you.
What? Wait a minute.
Why's the door locked? The dance starts in five minutes.
Okay.
Gary! Thank God you're here.
Can you unlock the door? No.
I didn't put that there.
What? Who else could have done it? We can't start the dance if the door's locked.
Don't tell me I wore my raw denim for no reason.
Don't you dare tell me that! I am not telling you that.
So the dance is cancelled, then? No, no, no.
There is gonna be a dance.
It's gonna be great and perfect and lovely and it will celebrate love is forever and ever and ever.
Where are you guys going? In life, nowhere.
But I know I don't want to be here.
Guys, please stay.
It would really mean a lot to me.
Boring.
It's Jess.
All of her chaperones just bailed, and she needs help.
A lady needs help? Is that a job for a boy? - No.
Or a - Man! - man? Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Well, the dummy patrol is ready.
Men! Men! Men! - Aah! Men.
Man! - So stupid.
Seriously, are you okay for real? - You got any ice? - Dude, rub his shoulder.
Rub his shoulder.
I'll get ice.
I'll get ice.
My shoulder go into his.
You all right? - Ow, man! - Okay, all right, just sit back.
Nick, get the ice! - How do you know how to do that? - Well, a tire iron is actually strong enough to break through a high-carbon steel steering wheel lock, so, you ow, I figured I'd work with this.
Cece scares me sometimes.
It's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend.
Got it.
There we go.
Oh! Yes! Everything's back on track, guys! This bike lock was a real punk move.
Seems like there's a lot of punks here.
Did you do this? - Hey.
You did this? Huh? You did this? - Hey, easy, easy.
If anyone's messing with this dance, it's one of those teachers Those hats were begging for payback.
Let's do this.
Hey.
Listen up, chaperones.
You will obey all of my instructions.
This means everything to Jess.
Your asses belong to me now.
Which means I currently have four asses.
The three of yours and mine.
I think we're capable of handling a bunch of prepubescent kids.
Do you think you are tough, Winston? You have no idea what these little bastards are capable of.
I mean, I love them.
I love them with all my heart.
But they will hurt your feelings sometimes.
He's right.
I remember sticks and stones may break your bones, but not if you're a fat kid with calcium deficiency.
Schmidt, you're on snack table duty.
Keep the chip bowls full.
Don't let the kids spike the punch.
And make sure Diabetic Amy only has four cookies.
Diabetic Amy ain't gonna get no cookies on my watch.
No, she-she has to have at least two or she'll pass out.
She's getting nothing as far as I'm concerned.
At least two, at least two or she'll pass out.
All right, Winston? Dance floor duty.
Yes, sir.
Ooh, you shouldn't have said that, man, that is the perfect place for me right now.
I got - so much heat coming off me, man.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No heat.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
No heat.
Hey, hey, hey.
None.
Hey, look at me.
No heat.
The opposite of heat.
Six inches separation at all times.
Nobody's getting pregnant tonight.
That's the same thing I say on my dates.
Not cool.
Let's h*t it.
Hey, hey.
Saving the best for last?
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick, uh, you're not chaperone material.
I've been at this job for a few weeks now and I know the stink of a bad kid.
That makes me the perfect candidate to be a chaperone, Coach.
Just think about it.
I can get in the mind of a bad kid.
Think like 'em, go deep.
I can go too deep.
I'm gonna put you in the parking lot to sweep for stragglers.
You want me on the streets.
It's not that important of a job.
I won't let you down.
I'm not gonna let you down! You taking a a break right now? When the heat moves you, you got to move Okay, no heat.
No heat.
No heat, Bishop, no heat.
Keep that heat locked up.
Keep that heat Think you're going, baby I, this is Crazy.
Put that heat away, Bishop.
Huh? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You got that, man.
You got What are you looking at? Cool mustache.
Too much heat.
Too much heat.
All right, kids, let's use the serving tongs.
This isn't Appalachia.
Hurry up, everybody, before Justin eats everything.
Son, I don't think you meant to hurt Justin's feelings, there.
What's going on, really? Are the parents fighting at home? Leave me alone, flamer.
Flamer? You're the You're the flamer, pal.
You're the flamer.
You're the flamer.
Flamer.
Stop saying that word, it's probably - offensive to some people, you flamer.
Flamer, flamer.
Yeah, take a doughnut, there, you flamer.
Flamer.
Schmidt.
I got a bit of a situation here.
Um, thoughts? Advice? What now? Aw, son of a b penis.
Ah, that wasn't better.
Sorry, everyone.
You were right.
Someone's trying to mess with my dance.
Hmm.
It's paste.
And it's fresh.
Banana in the dark.
Uh-oh.
You ruined my dance.
I can smell the paste.
Perpetrator! He's in there.
Okay, when we get in there, I'm going to be good cop, you be bad cop, okay? Got it.
There are two ways this can go.
Number one: you tell us why you ruined the dance.
Number two: I bash your skull in with a carburetor! - I thought I was bad cop.
You are the bad cop.
I'm the tough, competent cop, who's good at her job, you're the kind of fumbly, dumb cop - who's nice and - Yeah, that's not how it works, though.
I mean, the good cop is nice and the bad cop is mean.
That would be nice cop, mean cop.
It's how it works - on every cop show, when you watch it.
I watch cop shows.
You need to pay more attention.
I do pay attention - What do you awful women want? - We want to know why you locked the door and poured glue in the breaker.
I didn't do any of that.
Why would anybody want to ruin such a magical night? Uh, you're the only one who wanted to have this stupid dance.
Revenge would be my guess.
What do you know? Well, you have the grip of a much taller woman.
And I don't not like that.
Ugh.
some fireworks or something.
What's up, gentlemen? Just hanging out outside in the parking lot? We're not doing anything.
We don't need a chaperone.
Calling me a 'rone? I'm not a 'rone.
I'm basically the same guy as you.
We're wearing the same shirt.
I'm a good guy, I'm having fun.
I'm just I'm bored in there, I'm looking to hang out.
Is that a crime, officers? Say, you guys got any Billy Whizz? Any juice, any sweet Mary Jane? I'm looking.
Okay, if you're really not a chaperone why don't you take a sip of this? Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
I got nothing to prove.
Are you a 'rone or not? Give me that.
What is that? Is that a su1c1de? - The soda flavors all mix together.
You know it, bro.
That was super intense.
Sorry, I spit some of it up.
He's cool.
Hey, buddy, uh, Tommy, is it? I just I just wanted to apologize for what happened before, kiddo.
What, are you gonna propose to me, now? That's funny.
No, I I get it.
You know, when I when I was young, I too found that humor can be a useful tool.
Dude, get up, I'm not gonna marry you.
I,, found that humor can be a a useful tool.
And then you grow up and you become a man.
Well, you smell like a woman.
That's it, enough is enough with you.
You think you're a tough guy, tough guy? Prove it, man.
Name the time and place.
Fist fight? - Foot race.
A what? - Yeah, you heard me foot race, man.
I'll run circles around you and all your pals.
Oh.
You girls are multiplying like bunnies.
That's weird.
Lot more of you than there is of me.
We should lock all the doors.
No one gets in, no one gets out.
The culprit's inside.
It's frickin' Gosford Park! You need to just calm down a little, Jess.
I can't calm down! I want this to be perfect.
I know, but it's too late for that, okay? There are kids doing their homework in there.
It's bleak.
I know after what happened with Nick you wanted this to go great, but it's not your fault that the dance got messed up, all right? You'll get 'em next time.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh, that was a sugar rush, man.
That's a buzz in the brain! Ooh, ooh! You guys see how high I just got? I'm good.
He ain't a 'rone.
Too dumb.
Aw, this is fun, man! I miss this! I really do, man.
Let's keep going.
Let's get burgers.
Meet some girls.
Different ages, man.
It's so early! Hey, we got something to show you.
Look, guys, we had a lot of fun, but we can get in a lot of trouble for doing this.
Which is why you gotta run really fast when it goes off.
Like now! - Oh, dude! - Go! I mean it! Go! - Oh, my God! - Yeah! Yeah! What are we gonna do now? Let's ride.
Oh, hell yeah! Wendy? Busted.
Well, you really did come prepared, Wendy.
A wrench some glue a box of tampons? What were you gonna do with this? Um Oh.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
So you really didn't want the dance to happen? None of the boys want to dance with me.
Jess? Hey, Cece.
Hey.
This is Wendy.
She was just telling me how she doesn't like to dance with boys.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well that makes sense because boys are the dumbest.
You're just saying that.
No.
No, no.
No.
Cece and I have met so many boys, and they are all so dumb.
Yeah, and I've met more than her, so Yeah, and Cece has met more than me because she is nicer than me.
Nicer? - I just mean you've met 'cause you're well-traveled.
"Well-traveled" is how we're gonna say it? - I mean - You better tread lightly.
I will Travel You travel a lot.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think I'm ever gonna dance with a boy.
Listen, are boys dumb? Yes.
Yes! Do they do disappointing, stupid, stupid things that really hurt your feelings? Yes.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you plan them actually, they never work out the way you plan them but, in the end, it's all worth it, and that's why you have to try.
Are you talking about sex or dancing? - Dancing.
Dancing.
Oh, God.
Dancing, dancing.
We're talking about dancing.
Upright dancing.
Okay.
I'll try.
So let's get back out there.
Oh, Cece, it's okay.
There's no light, no music.
The dance is over.
Oh, no, this dance is not over.
We just need to find some stupid boys.
You look so slow.
Like a s like a s super dumb, slow turtle.
I'm so fast, and you're so old.
So much like a like a turtle, it's crazy to me.
Are we gonna do this or what? Oh, yeah, we're gonna do this.
I'm like a Hebrew cheetah.
On the count of three.
One two thr Flo-Jo! Flo-Jo! What are you doing? Hello?! Yeah! Yeah! Man! - What is your problem, man?! - I wasn't driving! Are you kidding me?! All students inside now! Go, go, go, go, go, go.
You three are the worst chaperones possible on earth.
A dog would be better than you.
A plant wearing underwear would be better than you.
Ray Charles' ghost would be better than you! Wh what kind of men are you? Hey! Stupid boys! We need ya.
Who's ready to have a good time? The lights went out, and you made your own light.
The music went out, and we're gonna make our own music.
We have a very special guest for you tonight.
Please give a big Coolidge Middle School welcome to the Dumbest Boys in School! I ought we were going with Sweet Surrender.
This won't be good.
Calm down, girls.
Don't get crazy.
Just calm down.
Okay, Coolidge, get ready to h*t the dance floor in three, two, one! Aw, yeah.
All right.
Rap battle.
8 Mile.
This one goes out to your vice principal, my friend, Jessica Day.
I don't wear indigo, I don't wear teal You better look out, you know that's right That's right 'cause 'cause Schmidt is for real, mmm I take that back, actually I do wear teal sometimes When I say "sometimes," you say "teal.
" Sometimes! - Teal! - Sometimes! - Teal! - Sometimes! - Teal! - Mic drop.
What's up, what's up, what's up? Anybody here from Chicago? Chicago, Illinois? City of Big Shoulders, Big Dreams! That would make sense.
You guys go to school here.
You're just kids, so you're all from here.
Somebody else, go.
That was it? Yeah.
Gonna be a cop, straight walking a b*at Role model, out on the street Unless I get assigned to a desk, which is also vital Because when paperwork slides, that's how you get a mistrial When I say "miss," you say "trial.
" - Miss.
Trial.
I said, when I say "miss," you say "trial.
" Miss, unless you trying to die.
What, are you nuts? Then know who you are.
A whole carton of dumbasses.
Ruin them khakis you got on.
Thank you all very much! Thank you! - I'm just saying, they're wearing light Hey, they're kids.
Good idea, Todd.
also got to die.
Ow! One, two, one, two.
Here we go.
(groans) (sighs) "You and Jess broke up." (sighs) Oh, man.
The bed got b*rned.
I thought it was a dream.
It was a not a dream.
I'm a little scared to see what's on the other side.
Writing left-handed is HARB.
(sighs) (spluttering) - Oh! - (shrieks) Goodness.
Hi.
Sorry.
I was just changing in the closet, like Superman.
Are we still allowed to see each other naked? - Yes.
Do you think so? I don't know.
Hmm.
Maybe.
Ah - Definitely not.
(goofily): "Derfi-niddley nit.
" (laughs) Boob season's over, for you.
Mind if I grab my socks? - Um, no.
You can go ahead.
I'll close my eyes.
Okay.
Hey! - Whoa! So how you doing? - I'm really good.
Good.
How 'bout you? - Great.
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the breakup.
Yeah.
I think I'm handling it well.
Yeah, you are.
You are.
You're.
You know, you're not drunk, you haven't left me And you're not crying while watching that movie Ghost.
Well, it's Dirty Dancing.
Doesn't Swayze do a dirty dance with that clay? That's not Dirty Dancing.
It's Ghost.
It's a different movie.
Which one takes place at camp? Dirty Dancing.
Which one's Whoopi in? Stop asking me questions about them.
Drop it.
(sniffs) So I saw this TV show about monkeys in India, and one of the monkeys, when it gets nervous and it wants to play submissive, it goes like this: And that lets all the other monkeys know it doesn't want trouble.
That's cool.
They also give each other oral pleasure.
And they masturbate.
So what do we do now, Jess? Well, normally, I would go home, but I already am home, so - (laughs) - can't do that.
I know where you live.
And I live where you live.
Should we tell the people we live with? - Yeah, let's do that.
Okay.
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do What you gonna do when I come for you? Hey, you guys, we have, um Big news! I just got into the police academy.
(laughing) Police naw give me no break - Not a solider mona give you no break - You know it.
Coach: He knows it.
Because you are a cop.
No, my uncle was on Cops a bunch of times.
He got no residuals, though.
He's poor.
That really is big news! Big news.
What a happy, happy day! Huzzah! And to celebrate, I'm gonna have a banquet in my honor.
A banquet for yourself? That seems tacky.
Can anyone here think of any reason why today should not be all about me? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
So I guess we're not telling anyone today.
Nah, it doesn't seem like the right move.
Yeah.
So we have to pretend to be a couple for one more day.
It's not that big of a deal.
It's gonna be easy.
Yeah.
So we broke up.
What's the difference? Um I-I couldn't be more okay with it.
Well, I couldn't be more okay, either.
Great.
Me, too.
Capital "O," capital "K" capital "A," capital "Y.
" I'm okay.
(crying): I'm not okay, Mom.
(sniffling) I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm sorry to pull you out of your dance class.
Oh, the recital was today? I know we did the right thing, I just I feel like really upset, and Nick seems totally okay and I guess I just need someone to tell me it's gonna be fine.
(sobbing): It's not gonna be fine, Jess.
I'm never gonna be a grandmother! What? Mom Stop crying.
You don't even have to love him, honey.
You just have to get that sperm cooking! - Mom - I'm sorry, honey, I just You know, this is where I'm at right now.
Well, this was really comforting, Mom.
(Joan sobbing over phone) It's like I'm in the womb, sucking my thumb.
Look, of course she doesn't know I'm in pain, Tran.
I'm hiding it like you're supposed to.
But I'm lying to my best friend.
You're also my best friend, don't don't start that weird jazz train.
I don't know how I'm gonna hold it all together.
I can't talk about it with anyone all day.
I feel like a piÃ±ata, you know, and I'm just gonna pop.
What does that mean: "The problem is the solution?" Oh, you mean just focus myself on Winston, and I won't have time to think about Jess.
That's really smart, but that's not exactly "the problem is the solution.
" Do you know what I mean? That's, like, a cool sentence, but it's more just "stay busy," right? Thanks, Tran.
If I'd met you in your prime, during the w*r, that would have been glorious! But then we would've been enemies and tried to m*rder one another, unless we formed an alliance.
Oh You and me forming an alliance in an old-school w*r? That's a fantasy.
Or a novel.
You just gave me another idea.
Winston? I've been thinking about it, and a banquet is not big enough.
You're not retiring from some insurance company.
So what do you really want, besides a piÃ±ata? Dream big.
Dream big, he said.
Okay.
Um If I had my druthers you know, 100% of my druthers I I gotta go Honey Roast.
The hell is that? And don't say it like it's some thing we know! It's a roast, except you say nice things about me.
Honey Roast.
Huh.
You know? Well, I can't wait to make that happen for you.
You serious? - He thinks you're serious.
How do I do it? - You just get everybody to say a bunch of cute stuff about me.
You know, all the, like, funny stuff that makes me sweet, you know? Done! What else? What? There's There's more? (laughs) Uh make me a prominent chair.
Like a throne? - Come on.
A throne? Who am I, CeeLo? (laughs) No, I just This is me, I'm still the same person.
Stop touching me.
I'm not gonna change.
I'm still the same person.
Stop touching me.
So make me a prominent chair.
Then you shall have that, Winston.
What else you want? I'm thinking maybe you should MC my roast.
Okay, I will.
And can you do it dressed as Furguson? I'm not gonna do that.
Thought it might be special.
Nah, it's strange.
All right, I'm gonna get started on that chair.
Schmidt: Well, this just in: the dress code for Winston's banquet tonight is is opt is optional.
Why would he write "optional" there? That's gotta be a mistake, right? And they're gonna give him a g*n? What are you doing back there? Thought it was about time I graduated high school.
Mmm - I'm proud of you.
That's it? No snide comments? I've got legions.
But I'm gonna be supportive.
"Legions" means "a lot.
" I know what "legions" means.
Anyway, I probably won't even take the test.
I failed the last five practice exams.
So that seems like a bad sign.
Of course you're failing.
You're studying here in a rowdy tavern.
Chumbawamba's playing, it's not even "Tubthumping.
" You're writing with what looks to be a golf pencil.
Where are your flash cards? Do you not have o-one single flash card? There's maraschino goo everywhere! You don't have a flash card? I'm taking over.
You need a tutor.
Yes, I'll do it.
You realize I have a boyfriend, right? Oh, the hunky Australian boy? Congratulations.
Cece, this is about your education.
Nothing more.
Mm.
He's actually from Perth, so Perth is in Australia, Cece.
We'll start with geography.
Oh, Cece, I really need to ask Schmidt if my outfit's working.
It is not.
I was in the middle of tutoring Cece! - Make it quick! - I know why you're upset, okay? I should've asked you to tutor me.
But he just volunteered, and I figured you'd be busy with Nick.
Well, I'm not busy with Nick anymore.
Oh, no.
Did you guys break up? Jess, are you pregnant? I feel like I made it weird with the pregnancy thing, you guys.
Did I make it weird with the pregnancy thing? 'Cause I really feel like I did.
I feel like, in my heart, that that was a that was the wrong to say, especially to two women who are sitting alone in a room together.
You know, I don't know where you guys are at with your lives But you're certainly getting up to an age where babies are on your mind, and-and I didn't want to throw that into the mix.
I could see that you were emotional, Jess, when you left, and I, and I don't want to make you more emotional by bringing up pregnancy.
And, Cece, you can probably barely spell "pregnancy.
" And I feel terrible.
Are you frickin' razzing me in there? Did I just here a razz? Damn it! So you're really building Winston's throne, huh? It's a prominent chair.
And it's not right! It's not regal enough! - How long have you been doing this? - It's for the Honey Roast.
I'm trying to think of cute things to say about Winston.
I got great stuff about his feet.
What are you saying, dude? You sound insane.
If anything's cute about Winston, it's his yawn.
(yawning) He goes, like (both imitating Winston's yawn) - Can I use that? - You're scaring me, man.
Like, for real.
Like, I'm scared for you.
Don't do that voice 'cause it makes me confess things.
I'm really scared for you.
I broke up with Jess.
You broke - You broke up with Jess?! - (quietly): I broke up with Jess.
Aw, man.
It's real.
Or she broke up with me, I don't know, but we're broken up.
Well, at least that explains all of that.
Kind of.
I just feel like I'm falling apart.
Like, my brain feels like spaghetti.
And my future feels like a dark hole that I can't stop falling down.
You can't show her this pain.
Or she'll freak out and it'll be over, okay? I wish someone would've told me that when Malia and I broke up.
(crying): Malia, I'm in pain and I want you to know! (sobbing) I want to get this pain out of my body! (retching) I haven't seen her since.
I still read her e-mails, though.
Every day.
Every day.
Every damn day.
Every day.
You have to hide your feelings no matter what.
And I am.
She thinks I'm okay.
That's my game plan.
I'm talking about pills, man.
Schmidt's got some anxiety pills in his top drawer, you know? - That's a great idea.
Do it.
Don't tell any of the roommates about the breakup.
Thought I made it clear that I do not want to talk about this.
Sure.
He just seemed so fine with it.
Like he's happier than me watching Coach watching Winston yawn.
(yawning) I'm sure he's just as sad as you are.
It's an act.
You need to go and talk to him so he can tell you how he really feels.
I'll go with you, okay? - Thanks.
Of course.
Are you guys Frenching? Okay, say you're Frenching and I'll stop knocking.
Ignore him, okay? Just ignore him.
Remember Cece, no one knows we broke up.
Not a word.
Nope.
Hey! - Come here, you.
Why are we doing this? Uh this is, uh, how I, how I greet everyone now.
And then I, uh, do this.
Then do that.
Oh.
And top it off with a little bit of that.
You feel me? This is how you greet everybody now? Ah, come here, you.
Uh, that wasn't an invitation.
Nick, hi! Son of a bitch! Come here, you.
What are you doing, man? - You take the pills? - Uh, I feel as if I'm of cotton.
Sorry for what's about to happen.
(grunts) (whispers a blessing) Do you have a minute to maybe have a conversation with your sweet, sweet girlfriend? I think the only way we're gonna get through this is if we're really honest with each other about how we're really feeling.
This morning I told you I was okay, and Why are you winking at me? - Am I winking? - Yeah.
I think I'm just a little nervous.
I'm gonna put my sunglasses on so we can keep talking.
Okay, okay.
'Cause I don't think I can stop this.
Please continue with what you were saying.
Um, I just, um, want you to tell me how you really feel.
Great.
Gre I'm sorry, "Great"? - I feel great.
Is great the, the, uh, is the emotion you feel right now? - No.
Oh.
I feel amazing.
(laughs) - "Amazing"? - Yeah.
You feel amazing right now? I just feel happier and amazing and lighter.
Tonight's about Winston.
You don't have to worry about me 'cause I'm worried about the Honey Roast.
I'm sorry I forgot that Winston is the most important thing that's going on today.
That's where I'm putting all my energies.
Fan tastic.
Took a long time to say that word.
There you are! (groans) - We're supposed to be studying.
Come here, you.
Ah, thanks, Coach.
I needed this.
Mm.
Delightful.
To you, too, my friend.
That is super weird.
What is wrong with you? What are you scared of a couple practice tests? Just something more important came up, that's all.
There should be nothing more important to you, Cece, than your future.
Because nothing is more important to me than your future.
Do you know how stupid it makes me feel to care more about your future than you do? Nick and Jess broke up.
(Coach laughs) I knew you knew! - Oh! - I knew it! So, you knew, too.
But you knew and you told.
Look, that was so sweet of you, Schmidt.
Okay? And thank you for believing in me - Who gives a rat's A?! - Hmm? Nick and Jess break up.
and you spring this on me like a, like it's a freaking weather report? I am a child of divorce! I'm delicate! Should've graduated the first time around, you buffoon! Better keep it together, dude.
No one can know you know.
Jess: Guess what, Cece? (door closes) My boyfriend Nick is totally frickin' fine.
He's actually, he's "amazing.
" Okay, wine.
Yeah, make it a big one.
A holiday pour.
'Cause today's all about Winston.
Nick: Yeah, it's all about Winston.
Somebody say Winston? - Whoa! - What? Guys, I gotta say, I am walking on air, I really am.
It's, uh Excuse me for a second.
Hey, Winston! Hey, it's your day! I'm diving in! What can I do? 'Cause today is all about Winston.
Yeah, all about Winston.
Whatever you want, buddy.
Mm-hmm.
Anything? My name is Nick Miller and I'm your host of tonight's Honey Roast.
Winston: Thank you! Thank you! And I'm Furguson the cat.
Ya-ya! Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast, we're gonna keep it sweet, keep it positive, and most of all, we're gonna keep it cute.
Am I right, Furguson? Hope that cat's not driving.
How is a cat costume just lying around? She has four of them.
I'm drinking a "Catbernet.
" - (laughs) - That's pretty good.
Okay.
That's pretty good.
A Pinot "meowoir" Meow-oi-rr.
If I have one more of these, you're gonna have to point this old kitty in the direction of my litter box because I'm gonna need to find it.
Mm, let's keep it cute, guys.
'Cause I'm gonna have to pee.
Speaking of cute, Winston Bishop is so cute All: How cute is he? How cute am I? Teddy bears buy Winston for their kids.
That was good.
That is exactly how cute I am.
Horrible visual.
Want to know how cute you are? Yeah, I want to know how cute I am.
You want to know how cute you are? I want to know how cute I am.
Puppys put him Not gonna do that one.
Are we still pretending that we don't - Relax.
Keep it together.
Mm-hmm, it'll be over soon.
Pretend like you're enjoying this.
Smile.
Mm-hmm.
Winston is so cute, he once met a Japanese gal named Ariko, and she started wearing him as a backpack! (both laugh) Boom! Ooh! I did not see that one coming! Oh, my! - I didn't expect it either.
Surprise ending! I think it's time, I think it's time that this cat takes over.
Why hold back? I feel like we should make this - a real roast.
Yeah.
Don't do that.
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
I'm kind of scared, but I'm also kind of excited.
I think, actually, it's my turn to - It's my turn! - Uh mm-mm.
Okay, back here.
This is the best idea.
I think I should sit down.
Getting a little mean.
(laughs) Time to add some honey.
Who's in the house? Coach is in the house.
What-what? What's up, Coach? You have so many sweatpants, you need to buy normal pants.
(laughs) Cece here.
You guys know Cece.
Your hair's so long.
Well, you're basically busted.
Good one.
That was good.
That was really a good one.
That was a good one.
Schmidt - Jess, please, don't.
I'm very fragile right now.
Your head's so big.
(laughing) That actually wasn't that bad.
You got a big-ass head, dude! And Nick Miller Oh, boy.
What can I say about Nick that hasn't already been said? Oh, here we go.
Nick calls birds "wind mice.
" Nick: Think about it.
Nick says "Yahtzee" when he climaxes.
Oh, boy.
He calls turtles "shell beavers.
" Well, that's what they should be called.
Jess: They're green.
Beavers are brown.
We've had this argument and we have agreed to not talk about it in front of others.
But you know the worst, worst, worst thing about Nick? - You don't have to say it.
You just - Mm-mm, mm-mm.
He's okay.
He's okay.
And I am not okay.
(sniffles) I'm not okay.
What are you talking about? Are you nuts? I'm falling apart.
Yeah, I I'm on Schmidt's anti-anxiety medicine.
What?! (laughs) Nick: Yeah, I stole it from his drawer.
Schmidty's little helpers.
Ooh.
Sorry about that.
I'm very much not okay! I was only acting okay 'cause I thought you were okay.
I'm not okay.
I am not okay.
I'm terrible! I know I'm smiling right now, but I feel terrible.
I'm so happy - Yeah.
that you feel terrible.
It's a devastating breakup.
You know, I know we lived together.
It's really hard.
It's tricky, you know? - Yeah.
You know, it sucks.
I really thought we had a future.
Me, too.
Yeah, saw the whole thing, the whole thing.
And now we don't.
It's done, yeah.
We have nothing in common.
(laughs) Yeah.
I also can't stop smiling because of the drugs, so my face feels crazy.
It feels like I had plastic surgery.
Winston: Can somebody please tell me what the hell is going on in here? - You want to do this? - I think we should.
Both: We broke up! - We're done.
It's over.
It's all done.
Are you serious?! What?! - What?! No! Come on, guys, it's so obvious.
Son of a bee sting.
I mean What, you broke up today? - Yesterday.
Yesterday.
Well, why didn't you tell me? Because we didn't want to ruin your day.
And I'm so sorry we did.
We're so proud of you that you got into the police academy, but we're just, we're in a really bad zone.
Yeah, a too bad zone.
So let's just come out and admit it.
We're in a terrible zone.
Are you kidding me? Something this big happens and you guys still look out for me? I mean, that's Thank you.
I really appreciate it, you guys, but I'm here for whatever you need.
Thank you, buddy.
Look, I know this is super weird and definitely high on anxiety pills but I'd like everybody to hold hands in this moment.
No.
Just do it, man.
That's it.
Everybody? - Oh.
It's two ladies.
I'm okay.
This feels good.
Om (all humming) (humming stops) Let's never tell anyone we did this.
Should we all try to live inside a peach, or is that weird? Guys, in light of what's been going on, I will be postponing the Honey Roast - until tomorrow night.
Okay.
Ah! - No.
Coach: No way.
Schmidt: Not doing this.
We could say everybody come back, - Sorry, Winston.
everybody come back the same time, so then you guys all get to wear white.
Hungry eyes (phone ringing) One look at you And I can't disguise I've got hungry eyes Hi, again.
I feel the magic (mutes audio) I'm watching Dirty Dancing.
I know.
I've heard all three screenings.
I just don't understand how Penny got in trouble.
Well, you know, it was a different time.
Who wins in a fight? Swayze from Dirty Dancing or Swayze from Roadhouse? I think, uh, To Wong Foo Swayze would win.
Jess, this is really hard.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to call you.
It's like a riddle.
I know! I don't know where to change or where to sleep or where to go to the bathroom.
Well, I know where to go to the bathroom.
But you know, the social component.
(sniffles) (chuckles) Oh, no.
I'm out of tissues.
Nick: I got it.
Heads up! Oh! Hey.
Thank you.
Nick: No problem.
That's what I'm here for.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
With these (sings along): Hungry eyes One look at you and I can't disguise (Nick joins in): guise, I got hungry eyes
We're all adults.
What's the harm? We can do this with dignity, self-restraint, and dare I say - honour.
The game is True American.
One, two, three, four JFK! FDR! Sorry.
Welcome to Ellis Island, folks.
You're a Bill, - Ah! you're a George, - you're a Bill.
Ah.
You're Greek.
Get out of here! What? Why am I Greek? You're a Greek.
Get out of here! - Get out of here.
And you - (moans) - He's got the plague! Scatter! Hello! (all shouting) Taft just sat on you! My name is Eli Whitney, and I created the cotton gin.
Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! - Gin! Gin! Gin! - (gags) (snoring) Oh, God.
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.
(groans) Son of a - (moans) (slurred): Jessica, did we die? No.
Alive.
Shh Turkey bacon.
Mm.
That's nice.
(slurred): That's ni, Nick.
That's ni.
Get sleep.
(moans) - (speaking incoherently) - Yeah.
(smacking lips) Help me up.
I'm trying.
You're (mumbling) You drink some water.
Aw, son of a bitch, the water fell on the ground.
(groans) Here.
Here you go.
Drink the water.
That's good.
(sucking) (phone ringing) Oh, no.
No.
Oh, make it stop.
Jessica, make it stop.
No! (groans) Oh.
(moans) Hello.
Jess, where are you? It's Jacob's first birthday.
You're his godmother, I need you here.
Sir, hi.
Who are you? This is a private residence.
I'll be right there.
(groans, exhales) (hoarsely): Hey, Nick.
It's me, Jess.
I have really bad news.
We have to go to a one-year-old's birthday party.
I'm not interested in that birthday party.
Thank you for the invitation.
Good night.
(groans) (groans) I'm so hungover.
Why today? - What? You think it went bad? We're your new neighbors.
Um, I think y-your bagel fell out of your mouth.
I'm Jewish.
Why didn't you guys tell me I was still wearing ladies' sunglasses? I look like Magic Johnson's son, EJ.
Hey, you guys, I got a problem.
You know that guy that I'm dating? Buster, your child bride? He's 20, okay? Not that it matters.
Is he smooth all over? Does he take baths in the sink? I sent him a bunch of drunk texts last night.
What? - Mmm.
(sighs) Oh, dear Lord.
I know.
"I miss the way that your hands smell"? Did you write an entire Jewel song in here? Is it from Pieces of You? You want to buy a rabbit with him? This isn't a text message, it's a freaking Russian novel.
Okay, well, you know what, what do I do? Text him one of the little yellow men.
The-the emoticons.
You know, with the with the fa with the faces.
I hate all of you.
Okay, so we really t*nk it with those babes.
Look, we need to orchestrate a situation which allows us to put our best foot forward.
That's easy.
We help 'em move.
Winston, Winston shh.
Why? It makes perfect sense.
Helping a girl move makes you come off as a doormat, you know what I mean? Honey, honey, honey, just listen to Coach.
Baby, look, let us handle this, okay? You go help Cece with the text messages.
You know, maybe I will.
Okay.
But only because I really do enjoy helping people.
You're gonna be great, buddy.
You're gonna do good things, man.
You think we were too harsh on him? He makes you.
He does.
Don't blame yourself.
(groans) How the hell did this happen? (Jess groans) I found some things and I put them on.
(groans) Throw this on.
Mm.
Okay.
That'll do it.
Cover up the tops.
You look great.
(crying) - No.
I couldn't have done it without you.
No, you're you're getting emotional.
You do this when you're hungover, but I'm gonna need you to stay focused so we can get to that party.
Yeah.
We just need the gift.
Yeah.
I got the gift.
All right.
Why is it in the box? It's supposed to be out of the box, assembled.
I said I would put it together before the party, and it's before the party.
So what's the problem? Just give me five minutes.
(pieces clatter) Ten minutes, tops.
But I got this thing.
This is it.
Christmas morning.
Our little guy waiting by the fireplace, but there's no gift.
'Cause Daddy's in the other room putting it together.
Did you say "our" kid? Yeah, sometimes I think about what our kid would be like.
(sniffles) Don't you? Yeah.
You don't think about the future? Can we not talk about this right now? Six hours ago, I was lapping cognac out of Winston's hands.
Drink it up, Checkers.
Forget what you saw.
Never talk about anything serious when you're hungover, Jess.
I don't even really think about it that much.
I just think about, you know, passing things.
Just Nothing specific.
We live in a house by a lake.
That sounds pretty specific.
We live in a town with a sense of history but not so much history that the locals are suspicious of new people.
Two small children who are so incredibly creative they named themselves.
We don't need to discipline the kids 'cause they're so afraid of disappointing us.
Our house smells like cider.
And if there's a horse out back, you're not gonna get any guff from me.
Anyway, that's where I'm at.
(scoffs) What are you what are you thinking? What, um Where do you picture us? Where do you Nick.
Nick.
Mmm, mmm.
Oh, God.
I still feel like crap.
Guys, will you, um, look at this follow-up text that I'm sending to Buster? - It's for the little boy? - Try to be helpful, okay? - What are we looking at here? - Are those nursing cats? Winston said it was funny.
It's not.
It's incoherent.
No.
It's borderline p*rn.
(sighs) Wait, those are not cats.
That's a human man! What is he suck What is he sucking on? - What Web sites are you going to? - What are you guys doing out here? Obviously we're creating an accidental bump-in with our hot new neighbors.
Elevator's on the move.
You got to go.
You're too hot.
You'll confuse them.
(groans) (elevator dings) Yes, well, of course.
It's my garden party, and Zachary Quinto is not on the list.
Um, you sure you can handle that, Winston? - I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ooh.
Are you sure? Winston: I'm fine.
I'm fine.
To the right a little bit.
Up right.
Son of a bitch.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
We'll get you some nice cold lemonade after this, okay? Ooh, be careful.
Oh! Good Lord.
You know what, we don't have to talk about the future.
Let's just put this toy together.
I want to talk about the future.
Okay.
Great.
All right.
I would love to talk about it.
Yes, great.
I always thought it would be cool to be a long-haul trucker.
You want to be a long-haul trucker with a family? No, the family would be in Montana.
Or-or Mars Landing, you know, if the government finally steps up.
Where is Mars Landing? Where is Mars Landing? It's on M It's on Mars.
It's the American capital of Mars.
And if you don't think there's gonna be space travel in the next 20 years, then you've got your head buried in sand, girlie.
It's already basically happening.
I always thought I'd move back to Portland.
Oh.
Portland, Earth? It's like friendly San Francisco.
Slow food, fast bicycles, great schools Education is very important to me.
That makes me happy.
It's something we agree on.
I really want my kids to beg for it.
What? 'Cause if you force a kid into school, he's gonna hate it.
Oh, no.
If you make a kid work and sit in the yard and grind and grind - and grind - What? eventually, that little kid is gonna beg for education.
Then you hand it to them - like the gift that it should be.
No! That's why public school's a joke.
I'm so hungover and my body's shutting down and nothing you're saying makes any sense.
There is something serious I have to tell you about the future.
The name of my firstborn child has to be Reginald VelJohnson.
I lost a bet to Schmidt.
Reginald VelJohnson? That is non-negotiable.
Unfortunately.
The dad from Family Matters? Well, the actor who plays the dad.
The dad is Carl Winslow.
What was the bet on? I said I could flip a big pancake (laughing): and I couldn't.
(muffled): How is this going to work?! The only upside is the original name was gonna be Ass Baby, and I kind of talked my way out of that one.
All of the guys in this building are so sweet.
It's no problem, yeah.
Couldn't be easier, really.
Just a p piece of cake.
Coach: We love it.
You know, it was my idea to help move.
The only reason we're doing this is because you forced us to.
If we don't help now, we'll look bad.
Yeah, now they're gonna think of us as "nice" and "helpful.
" Nightmare.
Hey.
Hey.
Coach: Oh, cool! Uh your brother? Actually, it's my boyfriend.
Yet he's not here to help you move.
He's out of the country.
Oh! Afghanistan.
Second tour.
Ah - Oh Please thank him for, - uh, for his service.
Yeah.
Are you and your boyfriend and Michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a, like, double date kind of thing whenever he gets back from Afghanistan? She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She's not really the relationship type.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm just having fun right now.
I feel you.
No, I feel you.
(laughs) Girl, I want to feel you And then there was one.
May the best man win.
I am also involved in this.
Winston, get out of here.
What is your problem? And then there were three guys Jess: Here's what I'm saying: Reginald is way too shy to beg for an education.
He's very sensitive, and when he's out on the horse, all he's doing is staring at leaves and writing poems about them.
Why do I have a horse? You know how many people are k*lled on a horse every year? Hey! You're not listening to what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is, I'm not gonna take Reginald out on the damn lake when you're out on your space truck - We're not living by the lake.
(exasperated sigh) Why would I spend my hard-earned truck driver money on an Earth house? - You make up so much science fiction - Science but you know nothing about science.
Do you know what science is? - Okay, science is more of a belief - than anything else.
No.
Do you know what science is? - Yes.
What you believe in.
Have you ever taken a science class? I've taught two at a community college.
When did you teach science at a community college? I made that up.
I didn't think you were gonna fact-check me.
My kids are not gonna beg for an education, okay? They're gonna be forced to go to school just like everybody else and they're gonna hate it! Can I actually be very real with you for a second? - Yes.
Here's what I really believe: You can create a plan for your life, and then crazy things get thrown at you, and that, by the way, is the closest thing that I have to a plan.
So maybe it's crazy to talk about being an intergalactic truck driver.
But what I think is crazier is trying to plan every single detail of our future.
I think it's crazy not to.
I just can't - live that way.
I guess we just disagree.
Well, we never agree on anything, ever, Nick.
Why are we doing this right now, Jess? We're hungover.
Just because I want to know we're going in the same direction, - that we're on the same page.
Yes, we are.
Well, we live on different planets! Oh You're talking about the fake future! I just I guess we want different things.
Clearly, we do.
Clearly, we do.
All right, so what are you saying? Should we just break up? (both laughing) Yeah, right.
Like we're just - gonna break up! - Just break up! Over what? You don't like lakes, I don't like space.
That's okay! This is not why people break up! I break up with thee, sir! (bad Australian accent): I break up I don't do voices.
I think I'm still drunk.
(laughs) Let's just get to the party.
Build this toy and go.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
We are an unstoppable toy-building team! Yes, we are.
Yeah.
All right, well, first hurdle: the instructions are written upside-down.
Ah, it's a false alarm.
Okay, h*t me.
What do you got? Okay, take the thing - that looks like a meth lab - This thing? and put it in the thing that looks like a pipe b*mb.
Oh, hey! - Hey! Now we're cooking with gas.
We're a good team.
I agree.
You know what, Jess and if you want to move to Portland in the future, then we're gonna move to Portland.
You know, we'll live by the lake.
I'll learn to fish, and me and Reginald will start a newsletter, you know "Lake Father, Lake Son.
" And you know what? If you want to be a long-haul trucker, I can deal with that for six months, tops.
Yes! - Um, this piece is a little sticky, - but I think I can just jam it.
Ah! - What did you just do, Jess? - Oh.
Well, I put the swastika in the guillotine.
How is this a children's toy? Why is it so brittle? What is that? I'm not sure what I've been doing.
(sighs) Hey, Michelle.
Hey.
You guys are lifesavers.
You have beautiful taste, by the way.
Really.
Is this early Californian? You know, this color, actually, it symbolizes a woman's fertility.
Huh.
I was pregnant once.
Cool.
What-what do you know? - Yeah.
Thank you, guys.
No, thank you.
So much.
You bet.
All right.
Talk to you la - You see her blink at me? Wait, you think that was a sex blink? That wasn't a sex blink.
That was definitely a sex blink, dude.
You would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex.
What? - It's over already, man.
You don't have a sh*t.
'Cause the chicks you pull are gremlins.
You did not just talk about my chicks.
My chicks look great.
Just like me.
I'm saying my chicks - literally look just like me.
All of 'em.
In varying color, but they look like me.
That is super awkward, and I don't feel like you know what - you're saying right now.
Whoops! Oh Coach! Oh, man, I can't believe you just did that to her vase.
Whoa! Dude! I will knock you out where you stand, and you in the ground.
I will pound you from the side! I will pound you from the back! That sounded weird.
Once again, Schmidt has found himself in a position where he is infuriated! I will fight your face! I will freak out so hard on you right now, you don't even know, on your face.
Winston: What are you two Oh, my goodness.
Guys! Her study-abroad mirror? Her dream vase? Come on, guys.
(huffs) Have some self-respect.
We're Nick: Hey, Jess? I don't think that belongs there.
That's why it doesn't fit in.
Well, I don't think this water bottle goes here, either.
But you put it there.
Well, why did we take the toy out of the box? We could have just given the box to the kid.
What does he know? He's one.
He eats pennies.
And he poos in his pants.
Because not putting the toy together is lazy.
So, if we can't put the toy together - I-I know, but it's not gonna fit.
You can't just keep pushing it because it Oh, God.
Okay, where's the tape? - Oh, we used all the tape.
Oh, you used all the tape.
Yeah, to fix the things that you broke.
You used a lot of duct tape.
Actually you broke a lot of pieces.
(laughs) All right, give it to me.
I'm gonna use a lighter.
And I'm gonna melt the plastic.
I'm gonna weld it together.
What? You don't think that's a good idea? No, you should, I think you should try it.
I also like doing Zippo tricks.
Ow! Aah, I b*rned my finger! - What happened?! Are you okay? Yeah, it's fine.
My skin's a little bubbly.
Well, I knew that was a bad idea.
Then why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago? Because I'm not Santa Claus! I don't just put toys together two weeks in advance! And also, it's none of my business what they want to do with the toy.
Maybe they want to return it.
Maybe they want to put it together as a family.
That is not my business.
What do you want from me, Jess? I just want you to take a little more responsibility.
Just a little bit more.
And I want you to have a little faith in me! I've gotten this far in my life.
And I'm doing just fine.
I mean, for the most part.
There's definitely a few blunders here and there that we could look past.
Whatever The blanket's on f*re! I can see that, Jess.
Go get a bucket.
Where is it? In the kitchen? No, that's for meat.
We need a different bucket.
Oh, right! The famous meat bucket! You said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea! Why would I think an unrefrigerated bucket of meat was a good idea?! To taste what meat tasted like before electricity! Why would you want that?! Why did you say it was brilliant!? Because, Nick if I was always honest with you then we would never stop fighting.
(smoke alarm beeping) - Let's go! - We have to go! Wait, my hat! What? My hat.
So sorry.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Sorry.
It was uncool.
I'm so sorry! Do you need? Here, do you want? Oh.
How did this happen? - It was Winston's fault.
He just ca he carries things wrong.
What?! I have heard just about enough from you two.
What? Ow! Schmidt: Winston! Girls, I know you're both smart enough to know exactly who broke your things.
It's the same two clowns who've been trying to sex Michelle every which way from Tuesday.
I mean, I ain't gonna lie.
I've been trying to sex you every which way from Tuesday myself.
I'd be crazy not to, Michelle.
You're a very beautiful woman.
You have crazy witch eyes, and I dig it.
You're like a witch! (laughs) You know.
But I'm a good guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.
My name is Winston Bishop.
Welcome to the building.
Whoa, Winston, I would not that's a - Winston, what are you doing? - That's a big (roars) - Okay.
Aah! - Oh! Whoa! - Son of a Winston, you do know that the building's on f*re, right? I got this! Move, move! Buster: Cece, hey.
Oh, hey, um, I didn't think you would pick up the phone.
I'll-I'll make this quick.
'Cause I'm sure you hate talking on the phone.
Oh, I actually do.
'Cause I'd much rather, um, talk in person.
You know? Face to face? (laughs) What are you doing here? I just, I was, uh, walking over here to see you.
Mm-hmm.
And then you called me.
Didn't all those texts really freak you out? Oh, no, no, no, no.
They freaked me out.
I thought you were gonna m*rder me.
You know, I called my mother, changed my locks.
Then I kind of, you know, had a change of heart, and I thought, "Well, you know, I like this girl.
" I'd much rather just come and look at you with my eyes.
And talk to you with my face.
If you ever got off the damn phone.
Yeah.
Right? - I, mm-hmm.
I understand.
Hi, Cece.
How are you? - Hungover? - Yes.
Would you like to come and get some pancakes? Yeah, I could, I could use some pancakes.
It's gonna be a bouncy ride.
My kangaroo's around the corner.
(laughs) But I did bring an extra helmet.
You're lucky.
(grunts) All right.
Nick, why is this so hard? I don't want to fight all the time.
I don't know, and it's awful.
Do you ever miss when we were just friends, Jess? And there wasn't this pressure to be together and to be - Be different people? - Yes.
Be different people.
I'm sorry, but I'm not that guy who's gonna put the toy together.
That's just not me.
I'm the kind of guy who's gonna leave it in the box.
I don't want you to be that guy.
I-I want you to be yourself.
I want you to be yourself.
Are we? (laughs): No! I love you! - Well, I love you, too.
More than I've ever loved anybody.
But what if that's the only thing we have in common? (sniffs) I miss my friend.
I really miss my friend, too.
So, what does that mean? Are we? Yeah.
(quiet laugh) (quietly): Earn this.
Was that Saving Private Ryan? It was.
It was a hu-huge moment in that movie.
And I just, I know this is a moment.
(both laugh) So, um, I'll walk you to your room then, I guess.
(sniffs) (sniffs) - Schmidt is living in my room.
Schmidt's in your room, yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think I could? - Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's cool.
(door shuts) Jess? Jess, you didn't have to run away.
I don't know what you're so afraid of.
It's just a man doing full downward facing dog in the nude.
It's a couple of testicles just hanging upside down.
(quiet laugh) I can hear you laughing in there.
Yeah, you liked it.
You telling Nick about it? What's he saying?
