And so, beautiful monkey cr*cker.

 Monkey cr*cker boyfriend.

 In Russia, we would strap you to goat - and see if you live.

 - (chuckles)

 And if you don't live, we eat the goat.

 May you die together.

 - (cheering)

 - Well, that was wonderful.

 - Did someone ask her to speak?

 - CECE: Okay.

 Up next, Nick's two best men: my husband and Winston Bishop.

 - (cheering)

 - SCHMIDT: Okay.

 Oh, this is gonna be trouble.

 Good.

 Okay, so, uh, Nick and Jess asked the two of us to make a toast - the night before their wedding.

 - But Schmidty and Winnie don't roll like that.

 - Uh-oh.

 - So why toast BOTH: When we can roast?

 This is about to be really funny.

 Okay, let's start with Nick.

 Now, I don't want to say Nick here is a lazy piece of human garbage with a flat ass and the writing talents - of a brain-d*ad alcoholic.

 - (laughs)

 Because why state the obvious?

 (Schmidt and Winston laughing)

 Oh, my God.

 - Oh.

 - But in a real way, Nick sucks as a person, y'all.

 - SCHMIDT: That's right.

 - WINSTON: He really does.

 But more importantly, his writing - also sucks!

 - (laughs)

 You know what they say: you put a thousand monkeys in front of a thousand typewriters One of them will be Nick, and he'll probably be writing The Pepperwood Chronicles.

 (laughs)

 That's a dumb-ass book.

 Maybe this is our fault.

 We threw this wedding together so fast.

 And you did tell 'em to go hard.

 I did actually tell them to go "hawd" and to not get "scurred," so th-that's where the confusion might be.

 - And that brings us to Jess.

 - Okay.

 Beautiful, big-eyed Jess who could have had any man she wanted in the whole wide world.

 - And still can.

 - And still can.

 - She still can.

 - Run!

 - WINSTON: Get your ass out.

 - SCHMIDT: Run!

 - He ain't no good.

 - Do you think this is funny?

 - No.

 - He's gonna drag you down!

 - That's a loser!

 Run!

 - Yep.

 And he's a piece of doo-doo on top of it he won't pleasure you, just himself.

 Do I really have to sleep at Schmidt's house tonight?

 - He wants to do facials.

 - SCHMIDT: Run!

 I feel like that's not what I think it means, but I still don't want to do it.

 Well, it is tradition to sleep apart the night before the wedding.

 So, what does, uh, tradition say about hand stuff?

 I'll have to check the book.

 - Okay.

 - WINSTON: That's Nick Miller.

 - What book?

 - SCHMIDT: Thank you.

 - Okay.

 (laughs)

 - Right there.

 - For real, though.

 - Okay.

 Have a lovely evening, you guys.

 Okay.

 - That was good, right?

 - Yep.

 - God, Mom!

 - I wasn't touching it.

 You shouldn't have slept together the night before your wedding.

 It is bad luck.

 - Oh.

 - Mom, that's just a stupid superstition.

 Oh, it is so not.

 Your Uncle Elmer slept with your Aunt Jeanie the night before their wedding.

 And they've been married 40 years.

 But he's gay.

 You're playing with f*re.

 - This marriage could be cursed.

 - Well, if the curse means spending the rest of my life with the woman I love, then I say - bring it on.

 - Oh, grow up.

 - I love you.

 - Love you, too.

 - Also, your Wang is out.

 - It is?

 (sighs)

 JESS: I'm getting married In the morning Even though it's later in the day Am I nervous?

 Maybe Damn, I forgot to invite Sadie Who knew my Uncle Elmer was gay?

 Hey, Jess, I'm gonna take Mario for a little walk.

 I'll see you on the other side of the aisle.

 I'd ask you for a kiss, but I don't want to mess with the curse.

 Well, that curse can kiss my ass, and you can kiss my face.

 That's very funny, but the swearing will end when we're married.

 - All right.

 Love you.

 - Love you.

 Have fun.

 (screams)

 (toy squeaks)

 Honey, you are as beautiful as the day you slid out of me.

 No one is gonna be able to take their eyes off you.

 You're a vision.

 Really?

 - I don't look like a pirate bride?

 - No.

 - No way.

 - Never.

 Mm-mm.

 Why are we lying to her?

 Not now, Ruth.

 (clears throat)

 Idea.

 Once I am finished with your hair, no one's gonna notice anyway, okay?

 Oh!

 Nothing that covers my shoulders.

 I want to make sure I leave room for the parrot.

 It's the curse.

 I told you.

 She slipped in the shower and scratched her cornea on a dog toy.

 That could happen to anyone.

 ALY: Hey.

 People on one side of the aisle won't even notice.

 - Oh.

 - Is it that bad?

 I just want to check it out.

 - It's fine oh.

 - Can I look at it?

 Oh, God, I look like a prost*tute from an Old West movie that everybody calls Winks.

 Oh, my gosh, I actually arrested a prost*tute named Winks once.

 Was she pretty?

 She was a good person, but she had her demons, like we all do.

 We don't need to talk about Winks.

 Ah Excuse me.

 Mom, what if it is the curse?

 What if I cursed my future with Nick?

 What if it's all downhill from here?

 It's not real, okay, do not let that get into your head.

 - Sweetheart, this wedding is a wash.

 - Oh, my God.

 You'll get it right the next time.

 - Joan - Cece.

 (indistinct conversations)

 NICK: Tran!

 Look at you.

 You look so good, you heartthrob.

 Hey, did you ever think Jess was gonna want to marry me?

 You did?

 Ah, see, I didn't see that.

 I just feel like the luckiest guy in the whole world.

 That's a very sweet thing to say.

 Hey, I'm feeling a little bit antsy.

 What's a groom supposed to do on his wedding day?

 I said day, not night, you little pervert.

 (laughing): I know what to do in the night.

 Oh, my publisher just showed up.

 I want to see what he thinks about my new book.

 I'm not gonna give him your poems.

 I'm not gonna do it.

 I gave you my opinion on 'em.

 There was some r*cist stuff in there that I didn't dig, and I don't want my name associated.

 I'll give him your poems.

 (laughing)

 There he is, father of the bride.

 I've been told to keep you to three drinks, sir.

 Very cute.

 Almost as cute as the toast that you gave last night.

 Let me ask you something as a fan.

 When you rhymed Nick's name with a certain body part, how did you come up with that?

 I mean, because, come on, brilliant.

 Thank you very much for saying that, it means He's being sarcastic.

 Oh, so now you can read the room.

 What the hell are you talking about?

 We k*lled it last night.

 Yeah, I explained every joke 

 - right after I told it.

 - Yeah.

 You stunk, like a a big wheel of Limburger cheese.

 Now, that's comedy.

 Stay away from me.

 Nick, I gotta tell you, Chicago Hobo is 

 - some of your best writing.

 - You really liked it?

 - Oh, I loved it.

 - What a relief.

 I had no idea you had such a difficult childhood.

 I mean, you've seen a lot of d*ad dogs.

 - 313.

 - Ah.

 - So, when are we publishing this?

 - Oh, no, no, we're not.

 Uh, it's too dark for the tween market.

 I-I thought you said you re you really l-liked We can sign you up for three more Pepperwoods.

 I feel like I'm done with Pepperwood.

 That's a great, that's great, that's great.

 - See, because he's Jewish 

 - Okay, yum, yum.

 Who's that bear over there?

 Don't answer.

 (wings flapping)

 (sighs)

 The curse?

 No.

 - Oh - Hey, I'm just, uh, looking for hairspray.

 What is going on with you?

 Nothing.

 Where's Ruth?

 Oh, she's busy guarding the bridal suite.

 No boys allowed.

 Get him, Mario!

 (whines)

 You sure you're okay?

 Because you seem to be in some pain back there, like you were in, I don't know, labor.

 What?

 No, my baby loves being in here.

 You don't even know.

 - All right.

 - (groans)

 I'm fine.

 Get out of here.

 - All right.

 - See ya.

 (Aly groans loudly)

 JOAN: Jess, honey, it's happening.

 - What is?

 - The curse!

 How often do you check your mail?

 Mom, you know your girl's paperless.

 - You're being evicted.

 - What?!

 This is from the new management company.

 I have to move out in 30 days.

 Oh, no.

 Everything's going wrong.

 You were right.

 I cursed us.

 - This is a disaster!

 What do I do?

 - Shh, shh, shh.

 - What do I do?

 Mom!

 - Shh, shh, shh.

 Sweetheart, I know just want you need.

 How about you try to relax with a little of the cheeba 

 - from Aunt Reeba?

 - What?

 - (whispering): Marijuana.

 - It's my wedding day!

 What?

 Did you bring that on the plane?

 - Yes.

 - Mom!

 Really, just take a small toke.

 It's not that strong.

 It's so weak, they call it g*n Control in America.

 CECE: Hey, babe.

 I found the hairspray, and Oh, my God, you're in your dress.

 Babe, you look so beautiful.

 I can't believe you're finally getting married, and - Cece!

 - Hey!

 Oh, my God, I am so high.

 - (whispering): Come here.

 - Mm-hmm.

 I have something to tell you.

 - Come here.

 - Okay, I'm here.

 Uh-huh.

 Whatever you do, don't tell Cece.

 - Mmm.

 - Oh, my God.

 Okay, how much of your mom's stuff did you smoke?

 It is so mild.

 Like, I don't even feel it.

 - Nothing, huh?

 - If I look in your eyes, 

 - can you taste what I'm tasting?

 - Mm-hmm.

 Okay, we have - 60 minutes till the wedding.

 - No, look into my googly eye.

 - Uh, do I have to?

 - Yeah.

 - You taste delicious vanilla cake?

 - No.

 - Damn it.

 - Okay, here's the plan.

 I am going to fix your makeup, - and then we ride this thing out.

 - Oh, I've got a plan.

 - What?

 - Check this out.

 - This is gonna be good.

 - What is happening?

 Or strap on a spare patch, and Nick marries a sexy fly.

 (buzzing)

 I'm just gonna remove this.

 Okay, here we go.

 - I can see.

 - Yes, yeah.

 - Mm-hmm.

 - So the upside to this is, at least you are not freaking out 

 - about your wedding being cursed.

 - Yeah.

 - That's a bonus.

 - Oh, Cece, question.

 - Uh-huh.

 - At what size does a cup - become a bucket?

 - Uh - Jess.

 - Russell!

 How the hell are you?

 Good.

 You, look, um Gosh.

 Mmm, did you have some cake yet?

 Uh, tons of it at my house, but that's my issue.

 Look, I really need to talk with you, Jess.

 - Okay.

 - (Aly groaning loudly)

 Did I make that sound with my mind?

 - CECE: You okay, Aly?

 - Mm-hmm, I'm fine.

 I just swallowed a wasp, and it stung me inside of my throat a bunch of times.

 I don't see what the big deal is.

 Please stay away from me!

 Okay.

 Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go after that girl right there.

 Russell, could you please keep an eye on Jess?

 Don't let her out of your sight.

 - Yeah, yeah.

 - Thank you very much.

 Appreciate it.

 Uh, Jess, you're, um your right eye's kind of stuck.

 (singsongy)

: Not if I do this.

 Much better now.

 Hey, so, um, we think we may have done a bad job with your toast.

 SCHMIDT: Uh, it's Winston's fault.

 - What?

 No.

 It is entirely Schmidt's fault.

 - This is not a funny man.

 Doesn't matter.

 Look, we want to make it up to you, so if there's anything that we can do, please just l-let us know.

 - Our marriage is cursed.

 - Wh-What do you mean, cursed?

 Last night I seduced Jess at the, uh, rehearsal dinner.

 I dangled my hot body in front of her, and she couldn't resist, and we had a night of weird, wild sex that would have made the good Lord proud, and now our marriage is cursed.

 Come on, man.

 None of that stuff is true.

 Curses aren't real.

 Yeah, but you believe in crystals, Winston.

 Crystals are real, dude.

 Don't say nothing bad about crystals!

 Merle said he's not publishing Chicago Hobo, 

 - and then a bird pooed on me.

 - SCHMIDT: What do you mean, 

 - he won't publish it?

 - Where's the bird?

 I'll poo on him.

 Those two things happened back-to-back.

 That's a curse.

 Stop being such a goy boy.

 You go find Merle, and you tell him that you are not writing another Pepperwood until he publishes Chicago Hobo.

 - You think it'll work?

 - I know so, okay?

 He's right over there.

 We believe in you.

 - You can do this.

 - I'm gonna do this.

 I'm gonna do it well.

 - Hell, yeah.

 - That's right.

 - (whoops)

 - Well, guess we fixed the toast.

 (indistinct chatter)

 Look at our boy, all grown up.

 Little disappointed about what we talked about.

 You know, you and I we make a good combination.

 - Winston and Schmidt.

 - Mm-hmm.

 - I set 'em up, you - And I set 'em up.

 All right.

 It looked good, man.

 How'd it go?

 Good, good, good.

 He told me to go to hell and that he's not gonna publish Pepperwood anymore, 

 - and I basically lost my job, so 

 - Mm.

 (slurps)

 Uh Curses are real, people!

 They are real!

 I got to go protect my bride.

 WOMAN: This is the oddest wedding.

 (groaning loudly)

 Oh, hey, Cece.

 Oh, I'm so mad about politics.

 Aah!

 Aly, you are having the baby, okay?

 - I know those labor eyes, sister.

 - Okay, fine.

 - I'm in labor.

 - I know!

 Why is this how we make more people?

 It's a terrible system.

 Oh, honey, we got to get Winston, 

 - we got to get you to the hospital.

 - No, no, no.

 I don't want to go until after the wedding.

 Aah!

 Take me to drugs.

 Take me to drugs right now.

 There we go.

 All right, here we go.

 I don't want to scare you, but this is the easy part.

 - You feeling better?

 - Yeah, yeah.

 The fresh air's really helping.

 We're in a stairwell.

 Ugh.

 You must think I'm the worst for going elbow deep in the ganj.

 Nah.

 In fact, I was high for, well, all my weddings.

 Whatever gets you down the aisle.

 Well, I seduced Nick last night.

 I lured him into my bridal chambers, and now we're getting evicted, my eye looks like ground beef, and I cursed our marriage.

 - You believe in curses?

 - Not normally, but I just want to know that Nick and I are safe, and no cartoon anvil's gonna fall out of the sky and crush us to smithereens.

 Is that crazy?

 No, but maybe it's not signs and curses you're worried about.

 Maybe it's the relationship?

 I mean, maybe, deep down, you know you and Nick aren't right for each other.

 Wait, what?

 What are you running from?

 Here I am, sitting with an amazing, beautiful, smart woman on her wedding day, and she's stoned and wearing an eye patch, and sitting in a dank stairwell with her ex.

 You want to talk about signs, that's a sign.

 A sign of what?

 Don't marry Nick.

 Be with me.

 Jess.

 I love you.

 Oh, boy.

 Ooh, hey, honey.

 Hey, Ruth, is Aunt Jess here?

 - I really need to talk to her.

 - What's the password?

 WINSTON: Oh, the password.

 Oh, uh, yeah, it's - Ruth 1.

 - Wrong.

 - Ruth 2?

 - Wrong.

 - Ruth 3?

 - Wrong.

 - Don't do this to me, kid.

 - Wrong.

 Ruth, honey, just tell us where Aunt Jess is, okay?

 Sure, for a hundred bucks.

 - I ain't got that.

 - I've never been more proud of that I mean, this is my daughter.

 - Unbelievable.

 - Yeah.

 Ruth.

 Man to man, I need to talk to Jess.

 I need to know if she's okay.

 But they're not back there.

 They're on the stairs.

 - Who's "they"?

 - RUSSELL: Look.

 When you first started working, I thought I was gonna be fine, I was over it, and then the more time we spent with each other, it just all came rushing back.

 And you're choosing to tell me this now?

 We've been together literally every day 

 - for the past week and a half.

 - Yeah.

 I shouldn't be telling you any of this, but I also know 

 - that if I didn't, I'd regret it forever.

 - Russell, I am in love with Nick, 100%, okay?

 This is not puppy love.

 This is old-ass dog love.

 Do you remember your first date with Nick?

 You ran into me sign and I asked you both to write down what you meant to each other on the back of some valet ticket.

 You kept those?

 I think you should look at those before you get married.

 Neither of you were ever sure about this, not really.

 Not deep down.

 Jess, be with me.

 Let me give you the life you deserve.



 - Let me make you happy.

 - (door opens)

 - Let me make you d*ad, you son of a bitch!

 - Oh, Nick!

 - (shouts)

 - Oh!

 No!

 (shouts)

 (shouting)

 NICK: I'm gonna get you 

 WINSTON: What you think you're doing, Russell, huh?

 Don't you have enough wives, you slut?

 - I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning!

 - Take that!

 I'm losing, I'm losing he's so slippery!

 He's like a dolphin!

 Wow, Jess.

 - That dress.

 You look so beautiful.

 - Thank you.

 But your eye.

 What happened to your eye?

 - No Oh.

 - Did this son of a bitch steal your eye?!

 - I'll k*ll you!

 - No, no, I hurt my eye, and then my mom gave me some of that sweet Portland b*mb-a.

 Look, Nick, I love you.

 I have no feelings for Russell.

 But how could you not?

 He is so handsome!

 I mean, look at him!

 He's physically outstanding!

 And it's all my fault!

 Because I brought the curse on us!

 Did the curse make you more handsome?!

 - Yeah.

 - That's my question to you!

 - He is physically incredible!

 - Nick, please don't fight him.

 We both know you're gonna lose.

 - BOTH: Let's do this!

 - SCHMIDT: I got your back, man!

 - Let's do it!

 - Yeah, unlucky for you, I'm packin'.

 RUSSELL: Oh, yeah?

 I can take all three of you.

 I kick.

 I kick really high!

 You're all so bad at fighting!

 - Boys, what's the strategy?

 - We h*t him, - then we h*t his ass again!

 - Uh-oh, - I think he heard your strategy.

 - Nick, take your clothes off.

 - What?!

 Why?!

 - I just got your suit pressed.

 - Time-out.

 - Time.

 Time.

 Guys, guys, guys, guys, 

 - Aly is in labor.

 - What?

 My baby's having my baby?

 My baby's having my baby!

 Are you okay?

 I love you so much.

 What if it comes out covered in all the gum 

 - I've ever swallowed?

 - Baby, you'll be fine.

 - I'll call the doula.

 - The doula's at Lollapalooza.

 Please tell me one of you g*ons is sober enough to drive this 

 - circus to the hospital.

 - Not me.

 I've been drinking all day.

 I only have one working eye!

 Well, I'll take you to the hospital.

 - Thank you.

 Thank you so much.

 - CECE: Great!

 Uh, we'll b*at you up after the baby is born.

 Why would you say that?

 Babe, why is your crystal out?

 Were you fighting?

 Aly, Winston, you come with me.

 - (elevator bell dings)

 - Wait, everybody come.

 I forgot who we're dealing with.

 (tires screech)

 Hey, hey, hey!

 Hey, only Blaze drives the limo!

 (car horn honks)

 Damn, they said, "Blaze, you gonna lose it.

 " And I was like, "Nah, it's too big.

 " (chuckles)

 Are you holding it in?

 You got to hold it in.

 Don't want it to fall on the ground and get dirty.

 That's not how it works.

 I'm really nervous about what you don't know.

 Hey, are we positive that this hospital has a baby department?

 - I think so.

 - I hope so.

 Ooh, Dr.

 Silverstein.

 Good to see you.

 (indistinct chatter)

 Hey, Russell.

 Catch.

 Your sixth wife is out there somewhere.

 It's just not me.

 Good-bye, Jess.

 Good-bye, Russell.

 Hey, do the right thing and get us the most expensive thing on the registry.

 (chuckles)

 Drive.

 Sorry about your hand.

 - (groans)

 - At least we're in a hospital.

 - Does it hurt?

 - Definitely.

 - Russell is shockingly strong.

 - Yeah.

 Especially for a boy his age.

 I guess the curse is real.

 Yeah, we got evicted.

 A bird deuced on my shoulder.

 I say this with love, but your eye is trash.

 Merle went crazy and decided that a book about a hobo with electric ankles wasn't a home run.

 And now I'm out of a job.

 We don't have a home.

 I mean, we're cursed.

 - (laughs)

 It's kind of our thing.

 - Yeah, it is.

 I mean, even the first time I kissed you, you know, you were still dating Dr.

 Sam.

 And now here we are in a hospital waiting room, three miles away from our wedding.

 - Figures.

 Sounds like us.

 - Yeah.

 Hey, do you remember on our first date we wrote how we felt about each other on two valet tickets?

 Ah, Jess, I'm sorry.

 I was just scared to tell you how I really felt.

 I was scared, too.

 We've both been scared about so many things for so long, and you know what?

 I don't care about the past or the future.

 All that I care about is right now, right here, you and me.

 I just want to have a weird, wonderful life together.

 You know?

 I want to get married and I want to take care of you, and I don't even care about a stupid curse.

 Guys, guess what.

 - Oh, my God.

 - Is the baby here?

 No, Aly's only three centimeters.

 It's gonna be another 13 hours.

 Yeah, the doctor told me to run around and burn off some energy.

 I was not being helpful.

 I'm excited!

 (laughs)

 - Wait, where are you going?

 - WINSTON: Huh?

 - It's that way.

 - It's over here.

 Okay.

 - Wrong room.

 - Wrong room.

 - Aah, aah!

 - Nope, nope.

 Nope, nope.

 Back over here.

 Oh!

 I just came from here.

 - Yeah, we know.

 - That's where she is.

 Go in.

 (Winston whoops)

 Hey, Jess.

 Do you want to have the weirdest wedding of all time?

 To you?

 That's all I want, Miller.

 This is it.

 How do I look?

 Beautif Beautiful.

 (Cece clucks tongue, sighs)

 Thanks for putting this together.

 Of course.

 Oh, thanks for doing this, Padre.

 You know, my day is normally wall-to-wall death, but, uh, you said so many wonderful things about this man, I couldn't help but say yes.

 I thought I was just a monkey with a typewriter.

 Winston's fault.

 That was his fault, 100%.

 (whispering): Thank you.

 Love you, man.

 You two seem like a very happy couple.

 - Thank you.

 - I'm not marrying him.

 I'm marrying a girl.

 - That's okay, too.

 - Music.

 ("Groovy Kind of Love" by Phil Collins playing)

 When I'm feeling blue All I have to do Is take a look Can we hurry this along?

 We're three minutes till the next contraction.

 Oh, no, I'm wearing white to a wedding.

 When you're close to me I can feel your heart b*at I can hear you breathing Near my ear Wouldn't you agree?

 Baby, you and me Got a groovy Ooh.

 Take care of our pirate bride.

 I'm very proud of you, son.

 I heard you fought like a coward - for my daughter today.

 - (chuckles)

 Thanks.

 (whispering): I love you.

 Anything you want to 

 - Hey.

 - Hey.

 We doing this, Jessica Day?

 We're doing this, Nick Miller.

 - It's about damn time.

 - (Jess chuckles)

 CHAPLAIN: Friends, we've been invited here today to share with Nick and Jess in a very important moment in their lives.

 Jess, do you take Nick?

 JESS: I do.

 CHAPLAIN: Nick, do you take Jess?

 NICK: I do.

 I now pronounce you man and wife.

 You may kiss the bride.

 Okay.

 - Oh, damn.

 - Is it bad?

 - Mm.

 - I've seen worse.

 I mean, literally ten minutes ago.

 I think you'll be happy if it's covered.

 (laughing): Sure.

 It's you and me now.

 (whoops)

 (whooping and cheering)

 - Hey!

 - Ah!

 (baby cooing)

 Everybody meet Dan Bill Bishop.

 Oh.

 Daniel William?

 Nah, Dan Bill.

 Uh, is Bill the middle name?

 Nah.

 Dan Bill.

 Dan Bill Bishop.

 Family name or?

 - Nah, it's Dan Bill.

 - Oh.

 Tell them you're kidding.

 I'm not kidding.

 It's Dan Bill Bishop.

 - What?

 - I'm not joking.

 It's Dan Bill Bishop.

 ALY: We're gonna talk about this.

 WINSTON: You were sleeping.

 I made an executive decision.





Guys, this has been fun, but it's time to go start my pre-date regimen.

 (to "Party Rock Anthem"): Body wash is in the house tonight!

 Ugh, that jacket!

 What are you and Aly doing tonight going to a Sinbad stand-up special?

 I'm gonna go pick up my colorblind glasses from USC.

 I'm a part of a study.

 Now, these glasses allow a colorblind person to see color.

 If they don't work, I get $25.

 If they do work, they're gonna take a bunch of my bone marrow.

 I just hope he puts on those glasses and realizes how truly hideous that Salt-N-Pepa jacket is.

 I mean, at least he stopped wearing the pants that go with it.

 - (laughs) 

 - Oh, my gosh, you guys, thank you so much for getting me out of the house tonight.

 Winston is insisting we Stay in?

 Why are you staying in?

 Because I might be overwhelmed by the world beyond sharp brown.

 Dull brown.

 Brown.

 You know, Aly's making sherbet tonight if you guys want to come over.

 While the idea of witnessing you seeing sherbet for the first time is enticing, I have plans tonight.

 Ooh, I see that eyebrow waggle.

 Yeah, that means you going on a Sex date!

 We are having sex tonight - out of our daughter's earshot.

 - Okay.

 Tell me, in the realm of Cece and Schmidt sex-capades, like, how far out are you going?

 Are you, like, crossing state lines or?

 No.

 Tonight, we are actually gonna keep it simple.

 I have made extremely elaborate plans.

 I've lined up a babysitter, booked a hotel room, commissioned a new negligee, custom-made by a Japanese man that I found on EtsyXXX.

 - I can't wait for Cece to see me in it.

 - What?

 I think that he bought me some sort of Japanese negligee.

 - (laughter) 

 - I know.

 I found it, like, hidden in the back of the closet.

 I'm gonna need a team of people to get me into that.

 Winston once bought me a Canadian Mountie uniform.

 - CECE: No, he did not.

 - Not to be graphic, 

 - but he destroyed it in seconds.

 - (laughter) So, Jess, what are you up to tonight?

 Remember when Nick and I tried to adopt that dog and got rejected?

 (crying): I love you so much, Harriet.

 I'm never gonna put you down.

 I'm never gonna let you go.

 I still don't get this.

 They took a dog away from someone for loving it too much?

 They said my enthusiasm for Harriet bordered on madness.

 Oh, I-I can see that.

 Well, it's been two long years on the wait list, but Everything changes tonight.

 - I'm asking Jess to marry me.

 - Wow 

 - (whoops) Ha!

 - Tonight.

 Well, it's about time.

 You've been talking about this for a month.

 I don't need this from you.

 I get it enough from Jess's dad.

 Bob called me nine times today to tell me that his blessing expires at midnight.

 - (whistles) - He said if I miss the deadline, my buttocks are gravy.

 Guy's got some weird expressions.

 Why would you wait till the last minute for something like this?

 'Cause everything has to be perfect; Jess is gonna think about this moment for the rest of our lives.

 I almost asked her at the park, but a squirrel ran off with our ring.

 Don't worry, I got the ring back, but let me just say this, the squirrel will never do that again.

 And then I got us on the kiss cam at Dodger Stadium.

 That's where I was gonna ask, but once we got on the scoreboard, I just went for the laugh and I kissed the old guy next to me.

 Anything's funny when you put an old man in it.

 Except for the ground.

 NICK: But this time, I have everything planned.

 Nothing's stopping me tonight.

 I made reservations at the same place we went on our first date.

 Finally, I'm gonna make an honest woman of My new dog.

 I'm so excited.

 And I get to surprise Nick 'cause he doesn't know about it.

 Our family is growing - by four small paws.

 - Okay, whoa.

 You need to reel that back in, sweetheart.

 Okay, I think you're right.

 There is a fine line between enthusiasm and madness, and I do need to keep this in check.

 Come on, ladies.

 Let's toast to 

 - Nick and Jess.

 All right.

 - BOTH: Yeah!

 And to us going on dates at the same time 

 - (laughs) 

 - leading to a high probability that we'll all be doing it at the same time.

 I'm not cheersing that, man.

 Stop.

 - I think it's nice.

 - Yeah, it'll be like one big orgy, but, you know, we're spaced out.

 Never mind.

 I retract my support.

 (toy squeaking rhythmically) Who's hungry?

 I'm hungry.

 You ready for our reservation?

 We have a What is all this, Jess?

 It's happening It's happening!

 - No.

 No.

 No.

 No.

 - (toy squeaks) Allow me to practice being appropriately excited about the following information.

 - We're getting a dog.

 - Really?

 - Yeah.

 - We've waited two years for this.

 - This could be a really big deal for us.

 - Yeah.

 This could be the night that we welcome a new family member 

 - into our home.

 I just - Wow.

 I don't want to blow it, so you have to help me keep it together when Judith from the shelter gets here, 'cause she has to do a home visit 

 - before she signs off.

 - You're not gonna blow it.

 We will form a great game plan at dinner, so let's go now, 'cause we got 

 - that reservation, like I was saying.

 - No.

 No.

 We have that reservation, like I was saying.

 We don't have time for dinner.

 She's gonna get here any minute.

 You know, last time, she was very thorough.

 - Yes.

 - It could take a long time.

 This is fine.

 This is foine.

 This is good.

 This is great.

 I'll push our reservation.

 I'll tell the restaurant we're celebrating tonight.

 We weren't before, but we are now.

 Get an outdoor table so we can bring our new puppy.

 - That's not the plan.

 - Say, "Make room.

 " We got to bring 

 - The dog is not 

 - a dog, a dog bed, a water bowl 

 - Good talk.

 - some toys, some chewies.

 (toy squeaks) 

 (toy squeaking rhythmically)

 I got you some stuff.

 Oh, my gosh, you didn't Will you look at this?

 Puzzles, a book on subway graffiti.

 Candy?

 - Mm-hmm.

 - Wait a minute.

 Baby, candy is different colors?

 That's what I've been trying to tell to you.

 Everything is different colors.

 Well, I'll see you on the other side.

 (Winston gasps) 

 (laughs): Oh, my God.

 Baby.

 Mm.

 Nobody told me fruit was different colors!

 - I thought you knew.

 - I didn't know about fruit, baby!

 - Now you know.

 - Ah!

 - Oh!

 This-this, uh, is purple.

 - That's right.

 - I'm touching purple?

 - Yeah.

 - I'm touching purple.

 - Oh, don't cry.

 - No, don't cry, baby.

 - (crying) - (gasps) Are my socks blue?

 - Blue.

 - Your socks are blue.

 - I hate blue so much!

 - Calm down, baby.

 Okay.

 Okay.

 - Aah!

 Some more blue!

 Get that Just calm down.

 Do you want me to find you something brown to look at?

 Would that be soothing?

 I just think I need to I just need to take it slow.

 I am right here with you.

 Why don't we go sit on the couch?

 Baby, what color is that couch gonna be?

 Oh, don't make that a whole thing.

 (screaming) Oh, I did not solve this Rubik's Cube.

 Help yourself to anything within reason.

 You may think to yourself, "Oh, they have a lot of expensive cheeses.

 They won't notice.

 " We wil notice.

 Okay, so, Ruth is asleep.

 That little face.

 I love her more every day.

 And, oh, look at you.

 Tell your genitals to get their affairs in order.

 Oh, my genitals know what they're getting into.

 (chuckles) Hey, I have really exciting news.

 I'm ovulating.

 It's time for another baby!

 Let's get to the hotel!

 We're so sorry to crash your date.

 Our hotel reservation fell through.

 WINSTON: Are you kidding me?

 I mean, I am so excited to have you guys here for my big day.

 Kind of wish you were here earlier.

 He was being a complete bitch about pink.

 No, I was not.

 I was confused, because they want to be red so bad, and I'm like, "You're not red.

 Like, stop.

 " You know what I mean?

 (laughs) Well, this is gonna be fun.

 - For a little while.

 - Or a long while.

 Who knows?

 JESS: Judith is gonna be here any minute, and I need you to test me.

 I looked up "cute dog" on the Internet, and I printed out a bunch of images, so I just need you to shove a cute dog in my face until I find something disgusting about it.

 I can do that.

 Oh.

 He's so teeny tiny that he fits in his food bowl.

 And he climbed in.

 He wiggled around.

 (laughs): He knocked all his food out.

 Which sucks, because there are so many starving people in the world.

 - Next dog.

 - Now we're talking.

 Good.

 I know what I hate, but I'm not sure what you're gonna hate.

 JESS (laughs): Oh, my God.

 I want to like this little lug.

 Jess, what do you hate about this dog?

 She's wearing a princess costume, which enforces gender stereotypes in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable.

 Next dog.

 I hate to do this one to you.

 No.

 No.

 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

 What do you dislike strongly?

 Is this guy rocking a jean jacket?

 Unfortunately, yes.

 I don't hate that!

 - (knock on door) 

 - Oh, my God.

 She's here.

 She's here.

 I feel ready.

 I feel ready.

 - Why are you acting so weird?

 - I'm not acting weird.

 Winston, will you come with me?

 I'd love to be the first person to show you a raincoat.

 I knew something was going on with raincoats.

 - Hmm.

 - Watch out.

 Excuse me, baby.

 What's wrong, Schmidt?

 You look green.

 Is it green?

 Cece wants to get pregnant again.

 Oh.

 (whimpers softly) Ms.

 Day, Mr.

 Miller.

 I'm hoping the second time's the charm.

 I'd like to introduce Mario.

 - Mario.

 - You're squeezing real hard, Jess.

 Your pictures don't do you justice.

 - (chuckles) - Will you excuse me a minute?

 - (laughs) - Very excited.

 (muffled screaming) Cece wants to get pregnant?

 Isn't that good news?

 Don't you want, like, a hundred kids?

 Yes, I do.

 I just How can I survive another nine months of pregnant Cece?

 She was so mean to me.

 I got your wings, my love.

 I wanted all flats, no drumlets!

 - Do they look flat to you?!

 - (muffled grunting) Do they look flat to you?!

 She tried to jam the business end of a drumlet straight up my tuchus.

 And then things got worse.

 I can only describe what I experienced next as anti-Semitic.

 Hey, gefilte face!

 Quit playing "Where's My Foreskin?" and get in here and rub my feet before I divorce your Yentl-loving, n*zi ass!

 (sighs) I knew this day would come, but just thought I had more time.

 Schmidt, you're being crazy, man.

 Just go talk to your wife about this.

 I can't do that.

 My only option is to knock her up and then disappear into the night.

 I'm gonna need you and Nick to take care of my family while I'm in hiding.

 Hey, be honest with her.

 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to stare at my tongue in the mirror.

 So, as you can see, we have lots of toys - for Mario to play with.

 - (toy squeaking) And it looks like he's found one he enjoys.

 Look at that.

 (sniffles) - Good for him.

 - Can I just say, I had some serious doubts about you getting a dog from us after what happened last time.

 You had a real Of Mice and Men vibe.

 Did I?

 (laughs) I mean, who gets emotional - over how cute a dog is, right?

 (laughs) - Oh.

 People with something missing inside of them?

 (both laugh) Will you excuse me a minute?

 Mm-hmm.

 - Hi, cutie.

 (chuckles) 

 - (Mario whimpers) Annabelle, you got to help me out.

 Mr.

 Miller, in 30 minutes, I'll have a barstool and a high chair.

 I might be able to get you a table, but I can't guarantee that your mariachi band is gonna hang around.

 - (beep) 

 - I'm so sorry.

 Can you please hold?

 Come on, Miller.

 Bob, I don't have time for this.

 - Clock's ticking, bub!

 - I know.

 But the hostess just offered me a barstool and a high chair, 

 - and I think I have to take it.

 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

 Let me talk to her.

 Merge me.

 Merge me.

 You asked for it.

 Here's Annabelle.

 Nobody say a word.

 Hey.

 I'm not doing anything.

 - What are you doing?

 - I have to get this out of my system.

 (high-pitched): Mmm!

 You want to cuddle with Mommy?

 You want to cuddle with Mommy?

 What's your name?

 Oh, widdle baby tired.

 He-wo.

 He-wo.

 What's your name?

 Is it Mario?

 Yes, it is.

 Yes, it is!

 Okay.

 Okay.

 I got that out of my system.

 Now we have to go sign some paperwork.

 Paperwork for a dog?

 What, are we buying or leasing?

 - Just get there fast, okay?

 - We can do fast.

 I like this.

 We got this.

 (exhales) Fast, fast, fast.

 You guys still on the phone?

 Mr.

 Miller, I did not realize you were taking care of a sick relative.

 If you can get here in the next 30 minutes, I can squeeze you in to a normal table.

 Thank you.

 30 minutes.

 Thank you.

 BOB: Nick, go!

 Hey, Annabelle.

 Tell me, uh you do a nice rib eye?

 Oh, no.

 Between me and you, it's trash.

 That's enough.

 - Cannot drink it, so I'm gonna pour it.

 - (chuckles) CECE: Hey, Schmidt.

 It's getting a little late.

 Maybe we should, you know, move along to that second location.

 (sighs) Cecilia I have something I need to say to you.

 Okay.

 Um first, let me say what an amazing mother and woman and partner you are.

 And deep down, I truly do I truly do believe that you are a good person.

 A good person who likes Jews.

 - You like Jews just fine.

 - Schmidt?

 I'm nervous about us getting pregnant again.

 You are?

 Why?

 Because your temperament while pregnant is, um Wish I had the words.

 - Winnie.

 - Hmm?

 - He have the words for you?

 - The words he used were - "constant terror.

 " - Why would you repeat that?

 Well, 'cause you know I'm scared of Cece.

 Well, I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry if I was a little bit moody while I was creating life with my body.

 Aly, can you believe this?

 - Well - Well?

 Okay, d-don't be mad, but I have never, ever seen anyone be pregnant the way that you were pregnant.

 So much so that, for evidence, I decided to capture it on my phone.

 CECE (on phone): What genius got us a Jolly Jumper?

 Who got us the Jol Okay, Vandana Auntie, way to go.

 You see, we already have a Jolly Jumper.

 So put the tuna salad down.

 Put it down!

 Tuna salad is for people who use the registry.

 Boo!

 Everybody boo.

 - Why are you not booing?!

 - I honestly don't 

 - remember that.

 - Oh, it's okay, Cecilia.



 Also, thanks for having my back, Aly.

 Whoa.

 I do not have your back.

 Yeah, I've also never seen someone pregnant the way you were pregnant.

 You were a coddling, blubbering mess.

 Aly, come closer, I want you to capture the luminescence 

 - of Cece's hair.

 - Shut up and keep brushing.

 You are a lifemaker.

 You have the jewel of life inside of you.

 Cece, what do you need?

 I'll get you anything you need.

 You'll never have to move again.

 That was hard for me to watch.

 - Uh, I was unbearable.

 - Yeah, we both were.

 (chuckles) Hate to see if you had any videos of me 

 - in that phone, which you don't 

 - I do.

 Mountie costume!

 JUDITH: Since this is a fourth-floor loft, will you be creating a f*re plan with Mario?

 We'd love his input.

 She means yes.

 Man, you got a lot of questions, Judith.

 And if you were on a walk with Mario and you encountered a coyote, what would you do?

 I'd run away.

 (chuckles) 

 - He's joking.

 - No.

 I mean, what I would do is I'd pick up Mario, and then I'd run away.

 And who would take Mario if your relationship were to end?

 Oh, thank God.

 That's an easy one.

 I would take him.

 - If we break up, I'd take him.

 - What?!

 - You think we're gonna break up?

 - I didn't say No, no, no, no.

 JUDITH: You know what?

 I actually I missed a question.

 How do you feel about pee pads?

 JESS: So in your vision of the future, we break up, you get to take Mario, and I'm left alone with some poop bags?

 - What are poop bags?

 - They're the bags that you put the dog's poop in.

 Why would you put dog poo in bags, Jess?

 It was a hypothetical question.

 But you answered it so quickly.

 Because I thought we were trying to rush Judith.

 We were.

 I just didn't think you'd be able to answer that question so easily.

 I mean, do you see us breaking up?

 No, I don't want to break up ever.

 I just 

 - (phone ringing) Hold on.

 Sorry.

 - Who is that?

 It's just the restaurant we're having dinner tonight, okay?

 - It's no big deal.

 - Look, I know this might not be the most convenient time to talk about this, but we're about to become parents to a dog, and I need to know we're on the same page.

 We are on the same page.

 I'm really sorry.

 - I have to answer this one.

 - You need to take a phone call when I'm telling you how I feel about our relationship?

 You know what?

 Let me take that phone call.

 Hello?

 Annabelle from Beso.

 Well, we're not coming.

 Okay.

 Bye.

 Where were we?

 - You know what's crazy?

 - Mm.

 Even after seeing all those videos, I still want to have another baby with you more than anything else in the whole wide world.

 Me, too, more than anything.

 Things are gonna be so different this time.

 I'm gonna give you so much space.

 I'm gonna be so pro-Semitic, that little beanie you wear on the top of your head is gonna spin.

 Feels like a rough start, but I appreciate the effort.

 - Let's go to the hotel.

 - We're never gonna make it there and back in time to relieve the babysitter.

 You know what?

 I know someplace on the way.

 There's no way that they're home.

 Nick is keeping those dinner reservations, I guarantee it.

 I didn't know when and I didn't know why, but I knew that one day I'd be having sex in this loft again.

 I hope Winston's room still has that exercise bike in it.

 - I have an idea.

 - Mm.

 You wouldn't think that woman would have a urinal in her bathroom.

 No, I can't go out looking like this.

 - I can't stay in looking like this.

 - Uh What?!

 No!

 You seeing this?!

 I ain't got no sense of fashion.

 You weren't gonna tell me?

 - I did, many times.

 - Then why didn't you leave me?!

 I did, when you bought those banana-yellow bird pants, but I came back because I love you just a little more than I hate those pants.

 (chuckles) Why-why are you taking them off?

 I just missed seeing your face with my own eyes.

 Look, I know there's a lot of beautiful things that I have not seen, but nothing in this world will make me take my eyes off of you.

 Why are you so sweet to me?

 - (Winston chuckles) - Mm.

 But we only have these for a few more hours, and I want you to see as much as you can, babe.

 All right, what's next?

 I want to see some classic movies in color: Citizen Kane, Schindler's List Ooh, I got bad news for you.

 (chuckles) This is a surprise.

 A real slobber goblin tonight, huh?

 What are you talking about?

 - Cece?

 - What?

 We are not alone in this bed.

 - (both screaming) 

 - (Mario barking) 

 - Aah!

 Whoa!

 Aah!

 Wait!

 - (Cece shrieking) No!

 - (shrieking) - No, no.

 Dog!

 - No!

 - Dog!

 Horny dog!

 That terrier att*cked my sensitive area!

 Okay, how do you think I feel?

 You confused me for a dog.

 I've never seen a naked man before.

 Oh, what are you guys doing here?

 - Who are these people?

 - We're trying for another baby.

 Oh, my God.

 Congratulations!

 We're adopting a dog!

 No, you're not.

 I've had enough.

 I'm taking Mario.

 Wait!

 Don't take that dog.

 Jess deserves Mario.

 This woman is amazing.

 She's gonna love that dog so much that she's gonna pick up its poop and keep it in bags.

 - (Mario whimpers) - Oh, wait!

 Mario!

 Mario?!

 Where are you?!

 Mario?!

 - There he is!

 - (Mario barking) 

 - Mario!

 - Mario!

 Mario!

 Is that Nick and Jess?

 - Mario!

 - Mario!

 Mario?

 Mario?

 Mario?

 (barking) I got eyes on him!

 (grunts) - Okay.

 - (Mario whimpers) Oh, my God.

 You got him.

 That was heroic.

 I mean, it was so stupid, but it really it was heroic.

 - Yeah.

 - Mario.

 I am so mad at you, but I love you.

 I mean, first you're running away from us, now you're happy to see us.

 You are all over the map, Mario Day-Miller.

 - (phone ringing) - I got to grab that.

 Is that my dad?

 Yes, yeah, your dad He, uh he calls me every time he he meets somebody from Chicago.

 I mean, he'll ask me, he'll go, "Do you know Tim from Chicago?

 'Cause he doesn't know you.

 " And then I just say "No," and then, yeah.

 That doesn't make any sense.

 My dad doesn't even like you.

 Well, that's what happens - Whatever.

 Who cares?

 - Wait.

 Beso's where we went on our first date.

 Did we?

 I'm restaurant blind.

 I don't remember restaurants.

 Okay, now, we got to get Mario back home before Judith remembers she wants to take him back.

 Let's go!

 Let's go!

 Wait.

 (gasps) Sweat back!

 Nick, you're lying to me.

 Oh, my God.

 Nick, this dinner were you gonna?

 Jess, I had been planning this for so long.

 I just wanted everything to be perfect.

 But it is perfect.

 I mean, it's us, so this is as perfect as it gets.

 Okay.

 (gasps) Is he about to?

 Oh, my God.

 Oh, my God.

 Oh, my God!

 All right.

 He's been keeping the engagement ring in a plastic bag.

 It's not even a Ziploc bag.

 It's just a generic plastic bag.

 (sighs) Jessica Day (laughs) will you marry me?

 Nick, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

 I want to raise this dog with you, and I want to have babies and eat good food and laugh and take care of each other.

 And I want it to start tonight.

 It's you and me.

 It's It's always been you and me.

 - Is that a "yes"?

 - Yes!

 Yes!

 She said yes!

 - I've had the time of my life 

 - (Jess laughs) No, I never felt this way before Oh, USC's never getting these glasses back.

 - They can take my bone marrow.

 - (Aly laughs) (laughter) Okay, so who gets the dog if you get a divorce?

 ALL: Shut up, Judith!

 - Dad, I said yes!

 - I did it, Bob.

 Oh, I don't know why you spent so much of the story talking about that color-blind friend of yours, but I'm so happy!

 Dad, can you lean away?

 You're bl*wing out the speaker.

 - (sobbing) 

 - Dad, are you okay?

 His reaction doesn't bode well for the speech at the wedding.

 What do you mean?

 - Cheers.

 - Cheers.

 Cheers to you, too.

 Oh.

 (crying)





- Mmm.

 - Can you two please tell us why you summoned us here?

 Thank you for coming.

 It is appreciated, especially since Aly is on bed rest.

 We brought you here today to choose a godparent.

 Oh, yes!

 Sorry.

 I'm sorry.

 Carry on.

 Now, on my side, we have my entire network of good friends.

 Friends so close, I consider them family.

 And on my side, we have Leslie.

 - I'm all she's got.

 - Oh, boy.

 All right, everybody, please line up in formation.

 Winston, I don't have time for this.

 It's my first day back at Ass Strat tomorrow.

 I should be moisturizing and making dreams.

 Schmidt, we didn't choose you.

 - You may face the wall.

 - Dork!

 - Watch it.

 - Cece, we didn't choose you either.

 Reason being is your friendship is too important to ruin by making you our baby's godmother.

 Mm-hmm.

 Why do I feel like your lips are moving - but Aly's doing the talking?

 - Sorry.

 - Nick?

 - I got a good feeling about this.

 Face the wall.

 Ooh.

 This ain't over.

 Leslie, you may face the wall.

 - Ha-ha-ha!

 Suck it, bitch!

 - Leslie, you lost.

 Leslie is confused.

 And now the moment of truth.

 Jessica Day, will you be our baby's godmother?

 Yes, I will.

 Why is Leslie still dancing?

 Leslie.

 - Hey, now we're both godparents.

 - What?

 Nick, for the hundredth time, you are not Ruth's godfather.

 Yes, I am, for the hundred and one time first time.

 First of all, Jews and Hindus do not have godparents.

 And even if we did, we would not choose you.

 Ruth is not a fan.

 Ruth doesn't like me?

 She sees you more as a dimwitted raccoon.

 Well, my mind is bl*wn.

 This is a game changer.

 Okay, everyone leave.

 Okay, that was a waste of time.

 We got a babysitter for this?

 Jess, can you stay back for a moment?

 Yeah.

 You chose wisely.

 I will revolutionize being a godparent.

 Your son will be my Cinderell o.

 We'll be reviewing your performance weekly.

 You can be replaced.

 Heavy is the head that holds the crown, but strong are the neck muscles that hold up said head.

 Ooh.

 Cigarette!

 - Well done.

 - Well done.

 Uh, before I move on to the next slide, let me just say thank you for agreeing to stay at home this week while I get back in the saddle at work.

 Now, you need to pick up Ruth at 2:00 p.

 m.

 on the dot.

 The three pillars of the pickup are gate code, sign out, and lunch, which needs to be a peanut butter sandwich, otherwise, she will shut down and go - full armadillo.

 - Yeah, I got it.

 Pick her up, drop her off.

 - How hard can it be?

 - Well, first of all, you got it backwards.

 You drop off in the morning, you pick up in the after I'm sorry.

 I'm a little stressed out.

 I know that I said that I would go back to work when Ruth started school, which, look, I'm-I'm excited about.

 But I've been out of the game for a while, and I've become accustomed to a different type of lifestyle.

 Daddy was gonna get into that party no matter what, so I jumped over the hedge.

 Of course.

 It was Prince!

 You get it.

 We'll be fine.

 What you see as a life-or-death mission, I see as a week off with my daughter.

 Wrong again.

 Buckle up.

 These should cover your first four hours.

 Okay, I'm off.

 Yeah, you need to go.

 Okay?

 Now get.

 I'm excited.

 I shaved my entire body last night.

 I feel like I could ride the wind to work.

 And here comes a contraction.

 Thank you for filling in for Aly.

 - Of course.

 I'm the godmother.

 - And one, two, three, primal scream.

 Oh, my God!

 That's a big hea Sorry.

 Okay, and now let's practice some pelvic tilts on the birthing ball.

 Oh.

 Excuse me.

 I-I realize you didn't get me one, so I'm gonna go ahead and get my own.

 Uh - Got the big boy.

 - Yeah.

 Whew!

 You know what's crazy is you're gonna be a father any day now.

 - Yeah, it kind of snuck up on me.

 - Yeah, you better get ready, 'cause you're gonna get on the Dad Train soon.

 Dad-dad!

 "No getting off this train.

 " - You okay?

 - Oh, yeah, I'm good.

 I'm good.

 Well, all right.

 Who would like to demonstrate how to hold a baby?

 Any takers?

 What about you?

 Oh, not me.

 That baby's creep city.

 Winnie, you're up.

 Me?

 Oh.

 Yeah.

 - Let's go, Dad.

 - Okay.

 Hold it like this?

 - Cradle the head.

 - Cradle it.

 Yeah.

 Well, look at you.

 I promise to love and protect you.

 Nobody's ever gonna hurt my goochy, goochy - Oh!

 I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry.

 - Okay, and I'm sorry.

 I'm gonna fix this.

 I'm gonna fix him.

 I'm not ready.

 - No.

 - Here, put that back.

 Put that back inside of you.

 I don't want no part of that.

 Look at us, the unbreakable Kim and Schmidt.

 God, I forgot how much I despise you.

 We're gonna need your thoughts on a new salsa account, - so get up to speed.

 - Oh, I am up to speed on salsa.

 Now heads up, Schmidt, things have changed here.

 It's not the same office you left.

 Ass Strat has been taken over by a Tokyo-based conglomerate.

 Are the toilets also Japa Yes.

 "Cecilia, you're playing your music too loud.

 " What's that, babe?

 Yeah, you know, I can't hear you out here with - Oh, my God!

 - What, are we having a laundry party?

 - What is that?!

 - This?

 It's just a bear I found outside the loft.

 Yeah, I brought it for my girl Ruth.

 Well, she's at school right now, and I have 15 binders worth of stuff to do that Schmidt has left for me 

 - before I go pick her up.

 - Oh, that's perfect.

 I'll just pick her up.

 I'll pick her up from school.

 I don't need your help picking up my daughter from school.

 Okay?

 All right, well, would you please tell her that I left this bear for her so she knows it was from me?

 - Mm-mm.

 - Ugh.

 - What?

 - There's ants all over its neck.

 - What?

 - Oh!

 There's more ants.

 Every time it gets h*t, more ants come out.

 Okay.

 All right.

 Hey, buddy.

 So, two things.

 Um, first of all, we're not welcome back in the class.

 And, second, they're billing you for all ten classes.

 Jess, what if I'm not ready to be a father?

 Winston, that was a fake baby.

 Real babies' heads - don't come off like that.

 - Jess, I was in that class and it made me realize that this baby is coming.

 What happens when I'm in that hospital and I see my son's face for the first time, coming out of Aly's butt?

 What am I gonna do?

 What if there's something that I don't know?

 I know this is gonna sound crazy, but ever since I found out Aly was pregnant, I keep thinking about my dad.

 That clown?

 He left you guys.

 I know.

 It makes absolutely no sense, but I keep thinking, what does he look like?

 You know?

 Does he think about me?

 Does he have a small group of white friends like me?

 Well, have you thought about, you know, reaching out to him again?

 I keep thinking, in a perfect world, I wouldn't have to track down my dad and risk getting rejected.

 He would just Magically show up.

 Exactly.

 - Sturdy.

 - Hey, Winston!

 Looking good.

 You don't have to gas me up, Jess.

 I've been at this thing for three hours.

 - It is all legs.

 - Yeah.

 Look, I just wanted to tell you something, and that is that when you're alive Sometimes your friends think that you're No.

 Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

 Your dad's outside.

 Okay, that's a weird joke.

 Yeah, that's not a joke.

 He is, um he's outside.

 At this moment.

 Well, how the hell did you find him?

 Well, it was a journey.

 Basically, I Googled his name, and here we are.

 - Oh.

 - Listen, if it would make you feel better to talk to your dad, then I think you should.

 Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

 I wonder if Nah.

 Okay.

 "Hey, D Hey, Pop.

 "You want to shake my You want to shake my Your hand looks like my hand.

 " He'll be like, "What's up, son?

" I'll be like, "Don't call me son.

 " - Uh-huh.

 - "Don't call me son.

 " You know?

 "But I love you so much.

 I miss I've never seen you.

 " I don't know what he looks like.

 Or I can tell him to leave.

 No.

 No.

 It's fine.

 He's my dad.

 I'll tell him.

 Say what you got to say, son.

 Daddy!

 - Get it out.

 Yeah.

 - Oh, my My God.

 - Look at that.

 - Look at that.

 - Look at that!

 - Look at that!

 Look at that!

 Oh, come on, now.

 - Come on!

 - Come on, now.

 Be feeling like I'm-a stand up in here.

 - Come on, now!

 - Come on, now.

 Okay.

 Kids' toys.

 I got this.

 Okay, I got that.

 Go for Nick.

 Uh, hey, Nick.

 Where are you?

 I'm at home making a goodie bag for my favorite little girl.

 Um, listen to me.

 Uh, I actually I need your help picking up Ruth from school.

 Oh.

 Isn't this interesting?

 Last time I checked, you didn't need old Nick Miller's help.

 Hold a minute while old Nick Miller laughs - and says, "Well, well, well.

 " - Nick.

 Please.

 Okay, I Nick.

 - Listen to me - Well, well, well.

 Looks like you do need old Nicky's help.

 Please.

 Please.

 Listen to me.

 Okay, Nick, I forgot my phone at the house, and that phone has the gate code 

 - that will let me into the school 

 - Hold on.

 If you forgot your phone at home, then tell me this: what are you calling me on?

 A stranger's phone, okay?

 Ruth's lunch is next to my phone, and I forgot her lunch, too, so just bring both, okay?

 Got it.

 Also Welcome back, Mr.

 Schmidt.

 I cannot wait to hear your pitch on the salsa account.

 Uh, take it away.

 I'd love to.

 Thank you so much.

 Let's talk about salsa.

 It's a sauce.

 Or it Uh Uh, I actually have to take this.

 So-so sorry.

 - Hello?

 - Daddy, come pick me up.

 Mommy isn't here yet.

 What do you mean, Mommy's not It's 2:30.

 What is she do?

 Okay, um Daddy's on his way.

 I actually have to step out for just a second.

 You know, in preparation for this meeting, I ate an entire jar of salsa, and it is sliding right through me.

 Ah, come on.

 Hey, little girl.

 Hi.

 - You want to open the gate for me?

 - No.

 No?

 You want Let me see what I got.

 A peanut butter sandwich?

 You want a peanut butter sandwich?

 Come here me a sec.

 Give me a sec.

 Look at this, look at this.

 Come over here, eat the peanut butter sandwich.

 Open the gate.

 Look.

 Mmm.

 So yummy.

 Come come on, come on.

 Where you going?

 Hey!

 Little girl!

 Come on, little girl, please.

 Where you going?

 Ah.

 No.

 Hey!

 What are you doing?

 Oh, I was just trying to get a little girl out of here.

 I want to be a girl's godfather.

 So, godfathers can basically make rules and do things with little kids when their parents aren't around.

 - What?

 Excuse me?!

 - And also, they love me.

 - You sick bastard.

 - No, no.

 - You're coming with me.

 - No, no.

 Peanut butter sandwich.

 Disgusting.

 Stop!

 Kids love me.

 I'm a famous author.

 Hey, he's with me.

 I'm a parent.

 - Parent.

 - Yeah.

 No worries.

 I'm, uh, I'm a parent.

 Okay, so what's the gate code, then?

 Gate code is four 

 - three seven 

 - You're guessing.

 - He's onto us, Cece!

 Run!

 Hyah!

 - Hey.

 I'm coming for you, Ruth!

 Here comes your godfather!

 Oh, my God.

 Is that it?

 - Wait, hold up, hold on now.

 - H-Hold up.

 - Hold up, boy.

 - You got bees on your shirt.

 - I got birds on my shirt.

 - Birds and the bees, baby.

 - Birds and the bees!

 - Come on, now.

 My boy!

 Hey, Aly.

 - What are you doing out of bed?

 - I heard a man's voice and wanted to know if you were cheating on Nick in the bedroom of my future child.

 Well, big news: I found Winston's dad.

 In there.

 You want to wrestle?

 Take off your pants, Dad!

 - You know what we like?

 - What?

 Those two black dudes from This Is Us.

 That's not Winston's dad.

 What?

 I saw his picture on the database at the station.

 I know this.

 That's not him!

 Huh.

 Jess, who is that man in my house pretending to be Winston's dad?

 His name is Van Bishop.

 But did he say he was Winston's dad?

 I showed him a picture of Winston, and he burst into tears.

 - So no.

 - I'm sorry.

 Winston was freaking out about being a father and kept saying he wished he could meet his dad.

 Of course you can sleep over, Dad.

 The couch lets out.

 Love you, son.

 - I love you, too, Pop.

 - Mm-mm.

 This is bad.

 They are getting closer every minute.

 You need to fix this right now.

 Okay, Aly, I got this.

 If you don't, when I have the strength to wrap these hands around your tiny little neck, I will do so.

 And I will smile.

 - This is all your fault.

 - This is all your fault.

 - Don't talk to me, okay?

 - No, don't talk to me.

 Now you're just gonna sit there and mimic me?

 Don't do the thing with the hands.



 - Grow up!

 - You grow up!

 - Are you kidding me right now?

 - Are you kidding me?

 - Don't talk to me.

 - Don't do the Cece to me.

 Don't do the Nick to me.

 Mommy!

 - Hey!

 - Uncle Nick.

 Hi, honey.

 I am so sorry.

 You must be hungry.

 Right?

 No worries, 'cause Uncle Nick 

 - has your sandwich.

 - I do.

 I have your sandwich.

 Here you go.

 You ate it.

 The truth is I sat on it.

 Maybe I took a bite.

 I took a couple bites.

 - I ate a lot of it.

 - You know what?

 It gonna be Oh, no.

 No, no, no, no, no, no.

 She is going full armadillo.

 I need my phone.

 Give me my phone.

 Well, I'm her godfather.

 - I'm not a fisherman's vest.

 - No.

 What you are is the human equivalent of the cr*ck between two couch cushions.

 Grab her.

 I'm gonna go start the car.

 So, anyway, I'm on the back of a Jet Ski 

 - with Cornel West.

 - Mm-hmm.

 And he tells me, "Hey, you're leaning too far to the left.

 " I said, "No, you leaning too far to the left.

 " Oh!

 I see what you did.

 I see it.

 Y'all talking about Cornel West?

 - Dad's got stories for days.

 - I bet.

 I bet.

 Anyway, why don't we button mash this for next week and, um, Van, I can give you a ride home.

 Wait, what?

 No.

 No, no, no, no.

 He just got here.

 You know, I want to talk about the old days in Chicago.

 Never been there.

 Garbage city.

 Yeah, it has its bad parts, but, you know, the education system is getting 

 - Wait.

 You've never been there?

 - Never been there.

 You know what?

 I totally know what he means, because I feel like sometimes I've never been to L. A. , and I live here.

 You know what I mean?

 Like, ask me where the ocean is.

 "Uh, to the left?" I don't know.

 - Should we h*t the road?

 - Jess?

 What's going on?

 Oh, no.

 Ruth hasn't been signed out.

 Um, excuse me.

 Um, have you seen Ruth?

 Brown hair, smile that would shake the earth, hates peas?

 A white man broke in today.

 A a white man?!

 No!

 Well, what did security do about it?!

 - Nothing.

 - Typical!

 I'm calling Cece.

 Go for Brian.

 Who the heck is Brian?!

 Where's Cece?!

 All right, Ruth, let's find something to play with inside this, uh, pillowcase of crap your future godfather brought you.

 - Oh, God.

 Okay.

 - There's this thing.

 - Put that down.

 - Yeah, put that down right there.

 Look at this!

 We got an old beeper.

 You can pretend to be a-a doctor, or a late '90s drug dealer.

 - What's a drug dealer?

 - Don't give her that.

 Gah, Ma, stop being such a narc.

 Okay, thank God you're alive.

 Of course we're alive.

 What are you doing here?

 I went to the school; Ruth wasn't there.

 They told me a white man tried to hop the fence, and some man named Brian answered your phone.

 - Hi.

 - What happened?

 - Nick ate her sandwich.

 - I had one bite of her sandwich.

 Guess, technically, "inhaled" it.

 - I didn't inhale it!

 - Guys, please.

 It's not a big deal.

 I'll make her another sandwich.

 No, you won't.

 About that.

 So We're out of peanut butter.

 What do you mean, we're out of peanut butter?

 I know.

 Okay, there was just too much to do.

 - And those binders.

 It is not possible!

 - I do this every day.

 You see, that's when the-the Chicago Cubs won the World Series, and, uh, all the players signed it.

 I need you to just be careful, 'cause it's worth a lot of money.

 I wouldn't do that.

 I wouldn't do that.

 I wouldn't do that.

 I wouldn't - Did Nick fix our child?

 - What are you doing?

 - Just making it pretty.

 - You're ruining it.

 Your face ruined it!

 You're a dumb raccoon.

 - Accurate.

 - Oh.

 As a godfather, I got to push through that.

 Ooh, that's work.

 - I got to go back.

 - What about spa time?

 I need to zap my frown lines.

 Oh.

 Uh, honey.

 You know what, honey?

 We can do pretend Botox on another day, okay?

 Why?

 Because Daddy has to go sell a Mexican product to Americans so that Japanese people can make money.

 I'm sorry.

 - Bye.

 - Bye.

 - Jess, is he not my dad?

 - Is he not my son?

 Before I answer that, I want you guys to know I had an accomplice in this, and her name is Google.

 Maybe I'm a little confused here.

 I called you "Dad," you called me "son" for hours.

 I sat on your lap.

 We ate pistachios together.

 I love pistachios.

 She told me that you were my son, and I believed her.

 I mean, you could be.

 The '80s were a blur.

 And I toured the country in a Van Morrison cover band.

 You did?

 Did you play the Portland Rec Center?

 Oh, maybe.

 It was a wild time back then.

 Hide behind a rainbow wall Slipping and sliding all along The waterfall with you My brown-eyed girl You are my Brown-eyed girl I can't, I can't, uh I-I got to go.

 I can't, I can't be here right now.

 Oh!

 - Oh.

 - Ooh!

 Brown-eyed girl Mr.

 Yukimura, uh, I apologize.

 - Sell me some salsa.

 - Okay, here we go.

 Well, what do we know about salsa?

 We know that it's a gift from another culture.

 Schmidt?!

 Are you with us?

 Yes.

 Uh, it's just You don't know how important salsa is until it's gone.

 You keep it in the back of your fridge, taking for granted that it'll be there.

 But once it's gone, you realize you can't go a single day without it.

 SeÃ±or Cha Cha's Salsa: the salsa that belongs in the front of your fridge.

 Sure.

 Throw in a dragon with a sombrero and I'm in.

 Great job.

 Moshi moshi.

 Hi, Mama Bear and Papa Bear.

 Goldilocks is here with an apology, - and it's gonna be just right.

 - Aly?

 - Uh-huh.

 - Will you please tell Jess to leave?

 You're not gonna talk to her?

 It's okay.

 Winston can talk to me when he's ready.

 Baby, she didn't do it on purpose.

 It's not her fault that she has zero detective skills, and there's another Van Bishop in Los Angeles.

 Which is crazy.

 - Her heart was in the right place.

 - It was, and should I have let a strange man in the house?

 No!

 Will it take a very long time for you to forgive me?

 Yes.

 Years.

 Okay.

 I get it.

 I'll go.

 Um I think this belongs to Leslie now.

 For what it's worth, you are more prepared to be a father than anyone I know, and that includes Schmidt.

 And look, you'll have good days and bad days.

 But you'll never be alone.

 And just remember, you don't have to have had a dad to be a great dad.

 Here.

 Thank you.

 I won't let you down.

 And you know what your mom looks like, so I'm never gonna present you 

 - with a fake mom 

 - Mm.

 - I'll stop.

 - Too soon.

 Hey, family, I've been sitting on the curb the last two hours, thinking.

 Look, I know I'm not your real dad, but a part of me wishes I was.

 You know, you're a hell of a kid.

 So if you ever need somebody to play catch with you, or give you the real deal when you step out of line, give me a call.

 Nah, dawg.

 I'm good.

 That makes sense.

 - Okay.

 - Okay.

 Am I still wearing makeup?

 You look like my grandmother right before she went insane.

 Good, great.

 I'm sorry I went overboard with the binders before.

 No, no.

 I'm sorry.

 I honestly don't know how you do this every single day.

 How was work?

 - Frickin' crushed it.

 - Oh, great.

 - And I think I want to quit.

 - What?

 Really?

 I just kept wishing that I was here, taking care of Ruth.

 It's the best job I've ever had.

 What would you think if I was home full-time?

 I think that anything that makes you happy and keeps those binders away from me, that's what you should do.

 Aah!

 - What is that?!

 Bear!

 - Yeah.

 And stay out!

 You bear!

 It's all clear, honey!

 I got rid of him





Who can say where the roads goes Where the day flows Only time And who can say If your love grows As your heart chose Coach said he should make it in time for the service.

 So at least it'll be nice to see him.

 Mm-hmm.

 - (sniffles) You okay?

 - Yeah.

 (sighs) This is gonna be hard.

 I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

 Who can say why your heart sighs As your love flies Only time And who can say Why your heart cries When your love lies?

 Only time Truly insane, this whole thing.

 Sorry for the holdup.

 Ever since I h*t my third trimester, I've been having the most intense gas cramps.

 Thank you for coming.

 Thank you for coming.

 Thank you for coming.

 (clears throat) It's hard to believe it's been a whole year since Furguson's departure.

 As you all know from my many e-mails and a sponsored tweet, I looked at Furguson as Jewish.

 So, in the Jewish tradition, we unveil his gravestone on the first anniversary of his passing.

 Furgie accomplished a lot in his time on Earth eating, sleeping, walking around, doing that thing with his paw.

 You know, where he licked it a whole bunch?

 (chuckles) Yeah, he lived a full life.

 Schmidt, will you begin the service?

 Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash sh'mei raba.

 - Amen.

 - Amen.

 (indistinct conversations) Thank you, Hannah.

 Good to see you.

 Just want to say I'm so sorry for your loss.

 I made a casserole.

 Can I have it?

 Y-Yeah, that's why I brought it.

 Here.

 - Mmm.

 - You like my shirt?

 - It's got cats on it.

 - Oh, yeah.

 - A lot of cats on there.

 - You know how you like bird shirts, this one has this one has cats.

 Oh, I actually wear fish shirts now.

 I'm trying so hard, man.

 You know, I can't believe it's been a year.

 I mean, Winston's handled this really well.

 Too well.

 He hasn't cried once.

 He hasn't had the cry yet?

 If he doesn't have the cry today, I'm worried he's gonna have a full mental breakdown.

 - COACH: Gooby!

 Gooby!

 Gooby!

 - JESS: Hey, Coach.

 - So good to see you.

 - Good to see you.

 I'm gonna need you to change, 'cause I was really specific about the dress code in the invitation.

 Could I say hi to everybody first?

 - I don't love it, but I'll allow it.

 - Hey, guys!

 - Player.

 Playette!

 - Hey.

 - Player.

 - Hey, Coach.

 - Gooby.

 - WINSTON: Coach, good to see you, man.

 What kind of adult man wouldn't be here to support another adult man a year after his cat d*ed?

 Yeah, I thought it was important to have a memorial.

 But you can thank Jess for everything looking so amazing.

 It was my vision, but she ran with it.

 Well, he was a good cat, he would have done the same for me.

 Maybe after you're finished with all this, we can go get you a replacement cat to replace, um What's, uh, what's his name?

 Um Cat's name is Furguson, you friggin' jackass.

 Hey, that was so not under your breath.

 - Oh, sorry, I didn't mean for him to hear.

 - Anyway, you know, Furguson was the only cat for me.

 I'd adopt one of those Peruvian kids for 70 cents a day - before I adopt another cat.

 - (laughter) I think there's a world in which you can do both.

 Those-those kids need food.

 And why rule out another cat?

 Furguson's not always gonna seem irreplaceable.

 I mean, it's already been a year.

 Uh, a year?

 Is a year a long time to you?

 How long would you wait before you replaced me if I d*ed?

 Okay, this seems like a "on the ride home" kind of conversation.

 I am not gonna get into this.

 'Scuse me, I'm gonna get into this.

 Um, Winston, Aly, do you want to help me, um, hand out schedules for the Furguson tributes?

 Um, I kind of just want to sit.

 Great, let's go.

 Uh, this says 3:20 to 3:40.

 I got 20 minutes to talk about a cat?

 Yeah, didn't you read the e-mail?

 We all have 20 minutes to talk cat.

 What a bad friend you are, man.

 - What a bad friend.

 - You know what?

 Keep it up, ham-calves.

 You called me "ham-calves"?

 - What is going on with you two?!

 - BOTH: Nothing.

 What did I state clearly in the program?

 No beefs.

 - Thanks.

 - Let me ask you a question.

 Uh-huh.

 - We're at my funeral.

 - (groans) "Ka-thunk" goes my coffin.

 Shovel dirt, shovel dirt, shovel dirt.

 You wipe the schmutz off your pretty black dress, and stopwatch is ticking.

 How long do you wait to remarry?

 I don't know, three years.

 Three years?

 Three year Not even a full presidential?

 Your new husband would still be finding my bobby pins in couch cushions.

 Uh, h-hello?

 Uh, h-hello, everyone.

 I am Dunston, Winston's coworker, and I have been asked to officiate this memorial.

 - (feedback) - Oops.

 Yeah, sorry, sorry about that.

 Uh, my hands lose all strength sometimes.

 I take medication for it, but it makes my mouth dry, and I wanted to be able to speak at today's event.

 That's why I didn't take it for the past week.

 Also, I ran out.

 So I-I guess I'll, uh kick things off.

 Uh, "Pick up hand strength medication" Oh, that's the wrong piece of paper.

 - Uh - Talk about the cat, man.

 The cat, the cat, that's right.

 JESS: Would you look at this?

 "Furgusson" with two Ss.

 The sca-bozos at the bake shop g*n it up again.

 I don't know what's with everyone today.

 Schmidt won't stop asking me what I'm gonna do when he dies, Dr.

 Sam's wearing a ridiculous shirt, and Outside Dave is inside.

 The sky is so close, and it's made of wood.

 - You know what the real problem is?

 - Hmm?

 Nick and Coach.

 They're at each other about some stupid thing.

 I mean, Coach probably said something pejorative about Chicago football's the Bears.

 - I don't know.

 - Oh, yeah?

 In your face.

 Are you joking?!

 - That's it!

 - NICK: Really?

 - You want to do this?

 - Hey!

 NICK AND COACH: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

 Jess, Jess.

 Jess, it's actually hurting.

 Seriously, ow.

 - Ow!

 Watch it.

 - I didn't even do anything.

 - My arm's swolt.

 - That just means big.

 No, I use it to mean sore.

 'Cause "swolt" sounds like it should be about pain.

 - It's onomatopoeia.

 - (mocking): "It's onomatopoeia.

 " - That's not how I said it.

 - Shut up.

 You shut up.

 You looked better a little chunky.

 Guys, whatever it is going on between you two needs to end now, so we can go back in there and celebrate the life of a cat, who, by the way, loved you both like sons.

 Now, what is it?

 Nick, are you mad 'cause Coach said something bad about wolves?

 Coach, are you mad 'cause he still thinks that the movie should be called Paul Blop: Mall Cop?

 It should be.

 It's so close to rhyming perfectly.

 They gave up.

 Blart is an actual last name.

 "Blop" is a sound effect.

 I need to get out of this situation before I get very angry.

 What is it?

 (sighs deeply) I owe him a little money.

 Oh, God, I knew it was something stupid like that.

 Coach, pay Nick back.

 Nick, forgive Coach.

 - (chuckles) - Or you know what?

 I can pay you back.

 How much is it?

 $71,000.

 Huh?

 And even though Ferguson walked on short legs, he stood taller than any man I have ever known.

 (cheering and applause) Thank you.

 - (feedback) - The hands.

 Sorry about that.

 Uh, please welcome to the stage our precinct's acappella group, - LAPD So La Ti Do.

 - (whoops) (to tune of "Mad World"): All around me Are feline cat faces Warm cat places Whiskered faces 

 - (chuckles) 

 - Nothing?

 No?

 - Hmm?

 - Do you remember these?

 Growing more hair Growing more hair With ears up top, they can't wear glasses 

 (laughs) Furguson's baby teeth.

 You know, I remember when he lost these all in the same day.

 Yeah, got into my taffy stash, he sure did.

 Oh, dip, white chocolate raisins!

 - ALY: Oh (crunching) 

 - No spray bottle (spits) 

 - Those are cat teeth.

 - Cat teeth.

 - (gags) 

 - Cat teeth.

 - You can tell cat teeth by taste?

 - Yup!

 - Meow, meow, meow, meow 

 - Cat world $71,000?

 It happened when I got my first huge Pepperwood check.

 Coach wanted to open up a gym and-and I wanted to help.

 All right, that checks out Only it wasn't a gym, it was a restaurant, "Coach's Jim.

 " J-I-M.

 It was a Ruth's Chris situation.

 They went bankrupt before they even opened.

 - My money was gone.

 - What?

 Coach's Jim?

 What kind of cuisine did they serve?

 And who's Jim?

 And why did Coach own him?

 Anyway, I don't need to know all of it.

 Let's just, let's just get back to Furguson, okay?

 I can't because this feels so good getting that off my chest.

 I need to tell you everything.

 No, I don't need to know everything.

 I know, but I want to.

 Here's the thing this is one that's been bogging me down for a very long time.

 Sometimes I wear my boxers backwards on purpose because I really like the snugness in the front, but I also really like the ventilation in the back.

 That's right, I'm smushed like a fat kid's nose up against the glass of a candy store window.

 (coughs) That felt really good to get off my chest.

 What else?

 What else?

 What else?

 What else?

 What else?

 What about this scenario?

 What if I d*ed jumping in front of a b*llet with Ruth's name on it?

 I know, unthinkable scenario.

 But what if?

 And what if she's president at the time, then I've saved the president and our daughter.

 Double hero.

 You know what?

 Just pick a number you're comfortable with.

 Okay?

 A hundred years?

 I'd wait a hundred years, okay?

 - Not okay.

 Not long enough.

 - Are you kidding me?

 We'd both be d*ad of natural causes.

 Perhaps the correct answer would be for eternity, forever.

 I don't need to know all of this.

 Let's just get back to Furguson, back to the memorial.

 No, Jess, because you don't keep any secrets, so I don't want to keep any.

 - Well - Jess, you are always 100% honest.

 So it's important that I am, too.

 - I mean - No, I want to tell you everything.

 I don't want any skeletons on our shoulders.

 There's one skeleton for me.

 - You have a secret?

 - Yeah.

 - Jessica Day has a secret.

 - Don't make fun.

 What, did you eat corn on the cob without the little holders?

 It's actually very emotional for me.

 (mocking): Oh, it is?

 What was your big lie?

 Let's hear it.

 I k*lled Furguson.

 That's why I've spent so much time on this memorial.

 One year ago, I k*lled Winston's cat.

 (crowd applauds) Uh, next up, we have Nicholas Miller and Jessica Day coming up to read a special Furguson poem.

 Nick and I will be performing a series of rhyming couplets about our friend Furguson.

 - (applause, whooping) - All right!

 (clears throat) Furguson was a good cat, yes, indeed.

 Many cat lessons from his life you should heed.

 With his proud lion mane and his big fluffy tail I mean, you think you know somebody.

 JESS: He ate all his food, even if it was stale.

 Struttin' around with his smushed little snout.

 He loved playing games and he loved hiding out.

 I think I still got teeth in my teeth.

 Like the time that he hid in the bag we brought burgers in.

 I just can't believe my girlfriend k*lled Furguson.

 (crowd gasps) Nick.

 What?

 Did I say it?

 Did I say the bad thing?

 I'm sorry, it just kind of came out.

 (sniffles) What the man says is true.

 A year ago, I k*lled a complicated and beautiful cat named Furguson.

 (crowd gasps) I'm so sorry, Winston.

 I didn't know how to tell you.

 NICK: She's not a bad person.

 She just did a bad thing.

 Don't try to save me, Nick.

 (Jess clears throat) I was catsitting at the loft and I was doing crafts that involved glitter.

 There was a glitter sale at Kraftwerk the store, not the German band from the '80s.

 And I spilled a bowl of purple, and Furguson took a bite.

 And an hour later, Winston came to pick him up.

 And the next day, he d*ed.

 None of this rhymes.

 I did a cat m*rder!

 I'm so sorry.

 Aw, Jess, come on.

 DUNSTON: Let's, uh, keep this thing moving.

 Next up, we have, uh uh, Robby.

 (applause) Uh Well, I was gonna do an interpretive dance as the red laser dot that Furguson loved so much, but it feels a little inappropriate in the current climate.

 Um - I'm so sorry, Winston.

 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jess, calm down.

 I talked to a cat psychic, she said he's in a good place.

 But then she also said he's with the cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and I know that cat's a puppet.

 So I don't know how reliable she is.

 I'm just so sorry, and can you ever forgive me?

 Jess, Furguson d*ed of a heart att*ck.

 - What?

 - Yes.

 The coroner said nothing about glitter.

 Did you say "coroner"?

 Yeah, I had a coroner check him out.

 It was quite possibly the most bizarre of my small-time abuses of police power.

 Oh, please let that be true.

 My stomach has been a brick for a year now.

 - I had to go on probiotics.

 - Jess, it's true.

 I was with Furguson when he passed.

 We were in the kitchen.

 - Go on.

 Tell us.

 Let it out.

 - (sighs) So there I was, in the kitchen toasting a bagel.

 Furguson was on the counter, just watching.

 You can imagine what a human toasting a bagel must look like to a cat: pretty crazy.

 - Really crazy.

 - Yeah.

 So there he was, just watching me, you know.

 And, um And then he got this look on his face.

 And then he stepped back a little.

 And it was in that moment that I knew something was wrong.

 And then he looked away, and, uh And that was it.

 He was gone.

 I feel like I'm living this moment.

 Oh, and then the bagel was burning, so I had to throw that in the trash.

 - (chuckles) 

 - That didn't get him?

 What?

 Shh.

 (quietly): You hear that?

 Hear what?

 I hear a meow.

 - You hear a meow?

 - Shh!

 Oh, God, he's not gonna cry, he's gonna go insane.

 Wait, wait, wait.

 I-I'm sorry I'm hearing something.

 I hear a cat, and it is in distress.

 There is a cat in the building, and it needs me!

 Meow!

 Thank you.

 Please don't look over there.

 - (Winston meowing) - No reason to watch a grown man lose his mind.

 - Thank you.

 - Thanks for having me.

 You have a really beautiful home.

 WINSTON: Meow!

 Meow, meow, meow!

 Here, kitty cat.

 You're a baby covered in hair This is the voice I used to use to make Furguson come to me.

 Honey, are you sure you're hearing a cat?

 'Cause, you know, maybe it's just a little 



 - voice in 

 - Baby, it's a cat.

 Okay?

 I know a meow when I hear one.

 Guys, can you help us "look for the cat," so I can talk to Winston?

 Good call.

 Jess and I will check the back office.

 Kitty, Kitty, where are you?

 Oh, look!

 Cat poop.

 Uh, it's still warm.

 (mouthing) Do you want to take a break from looking 

 - for a fake cat?

 - Yes.

 I hid something in here when I used to own the place.

 Check this.

 Aw, it's still here.

 - Ah-ha-ha!

 - Ah-ha-ha.

 Hey, I'm so sorry I lied about Furguson.

 I just I didn't want you to look at me differently.

 Can I be honest?

 I think it's kind of hot that you kept that as a secret.

 - Really?

 - Yeah.

 Jessica Day, a m*rder?

 Keeping m*rder a secret?

 Am I attracted to m*rder?

 Well, it turns out I didn't k*ll him, so But if you did, I want you to know that I'd I'd help you bury the body.

 You know that, right?

 Weirdly, yes, I do.

 I do know that.

 'Cause it could wake up, and if it did, I would just h*t it over the head with a shovel and then just keep burying it in the hot desert sand.

 Wait, why are we going all the way out to the desert?

 What's wrong with the woods?

 Well, only psychos bury stuff in the woods, Jess.

 But listen, the reason I didn't tell you I lent Coach money was, I was afraid that one of the reasons we broke up in the past was 'cause I was bad at money, 

 - and I didn't want to scare you off.

 - Nick.

 Nothing you could do would scare me off.

 We're in this together.

 Cat m*rder and all.

 Well, there's nothing that you could do that would make me love you any less.

 You know you need to fix things with Coach.

 Yeah.

 Cat!

 Where you at?

 Okay, you know what?

 Here's my new scenario.

 (groans) 

 - I'm in the Merchant Marines 

 - Stop it.

 I only blurted out "three years" because I don't even want to think about you being gone.

 I don't know what I would do without you.

 I would end up dragging a lawn chair out to your grave on the Fourth of July and lighting a sparkler, and Ruth wouldn't want to come with me because she would say "Mommy, Kevin's having a party, and I don't want to go to the grave again.

 " Okay?

 So I'm just alone, on a chair, and I miss you.

 I don't want you alone at my grave.

 That sounds terrible.

 I want you to be with your new husband at my grave.

 I want you to find someone who's gonna take care of you, who's gonna love you as much as I do.

 I just want you.

 Well, it's too late for that.

 I-I'm d*ad.

 - No.

 - It's a waste of time.

 I might as well be 

 - at the bottom of the ocean.

 - Stop.

 You have to move on.

 Uh, hey, Dunston.

 - Uh Hey.

 - Hey, can you come here for a sec?

 - You were great tonight, by the way.

 - Oh, thank you.

 You did a very good job under difficult circumstances.

 Thank you very much.

 So I'm gonna die, and I need you to take care of my wife.

 Super.

 We're fine.

 Thank you.

 - Okay.

 - (laughing): Okay.

 Should I join in or just watch?

 What exactly are we doing here?

 Who wants to begin?

 I mean (sighs) I'm not even mad about the money.

 I'm just mad that Coach and I never talk anymore.

 COACH: What are you talking about, man?

 I called and asked you if elephants are basically pigs, and you were like "no," and I was like "cool.

 " Yeah, and that was an awesome conversation.

 It was also three years ago, man.

 We haven't talked since.

 I mean, honestly, I'd pay another $70,000 to have my friend back.

 I feel like we're close.

 Let's bring it home.

 I guess I just stopped talking to you 'cause I was embarrassed.

 NICK: Embarrassed with me?

 You've seen me trip after a shower and rug burn my penis on a towel.

 (laughing): Classic Nick.

 - It really b*rned.

 - It was so scabby.

 - NICK: Yeah.

 - COACH: It scabbed up like crazy.

 - Yes, it did.

 - Like a grilled shrimp.

 Like grilled jumbo shrimp.

 Eh.

 I'm gonna pay you back, man.

 No matter how long it takes.

 I promise.

 And to prove it to you, I brought $5,000 as your first installment.

 You brought it in cash?

 Why is everyone so cavalier about large sums of money?

 You just dropped, like, $600.

 I can hear him.

 Don't worry, cat.

 I'm coming to save you.

 ALY: Winston, Winston!

 Stop it.

 Babe.

 Babe, sit down, sit down.

 Winston.

 Baby, I love you, but these meows are in your head.

 Okay?

 It's because you haven't cried over Furguson yet, and not letting yourself have a good cry has made you a little doy-doy.

 You know (strumming lips) It's made you really dumb and stupid, and you're not those things.

 Now is the time to let it all out.

 Right now, Winston.

 You don't have to try to be strong for me.

 (crying) Wow, those sinuses swelled up fast.

 (screaming) My cat, my cat, my cat.

 You know, it didn't h*t me at first, and then, by the time that it did, you were already pregnant, and I just wanted to be I wanted to be the rock for this family.

 Baby, if there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I'm the rock in this family.

 Yeah, but if you're the rock, then what am I?

 You're the beautiful flower sprouting out from the rock.

 - I like flowers, so - I know you do, buddy.

 - WINSTON: Yeah.

 - Oh, buddy.

 - Hey, buddy.

 - Hey, buddy.

 - Hey, buddy.

 - Hey, buddy.

 Oh, I like it when y'all call me "buddy.

 " It's nice.

 Also, you can stop looking for the cat.

 I don't want to blow you guys' minds, but, uh it ain't real.

 SCHMIDT: What?

 The cat isn't real?

 That's a This is all so Shyamalanian.

 I guess I just been keeping things bottled up 

 - a little too tight.

 - (cat meowing) Shh.

 Okay, I can't even believe I'm saying this, 

 - but I think I hear a cat.

 - Come on, now.

 No, I'm serious.

 Listen.

 (meowing) Well, I did not see that coming.

 SCHMIDT: It's coming from the couch.

 (meowing) 

 - (gasps) 

 - Aw.

 (meows) Oh, my God, he's scared.

 Man, don't be scared.

 - He loves you.

 - Yeah, I'm here, okay?

 Baby, he's not wearing any tags.

 Which means he's a stray.

 - Can we?

 - Okay, yes, but only if you feed him from one of those bottles like in a zoo documentary, 'cause I like that, that's cute as hell.

 (laughs) Hey.

 - You found my cat.

 - Well Oh, that's the bartender's bar cat.

 I'm sorry, but, uh, that cat's gone.

 - Give me my cat back.

 - JESS: Wait.

 Um, what if we were to offer you $5,000 in cash for the cat?

 Oh, yeah, then, totally.

 That'd be fine.

 $5,000.

 Curious, what's the lowest amount you would have taken for that cat?

 I don't know, maybe, like, uh, 50 bucks?

 - $50.

 - Yeah.

 - That's considerably less than $5,000.

 - Oh, yeah.

 Here you go.

 I think I'm gonna name him NAFTA.

 - ALL: Aw!

 - I don't like it.

 His name's actually Mitzi.

 - ALL: NAFTA!

 - (laughter)

 (cat meows)

 WINSTON: Meow!

 Meow!





Ladies, stop stuffing yourselves with pancakes.

 Daddy's coming in at a nine, and we're seconds away from being at a ten.

 I got Ruth an interview at Lillypads, the most prestigious preschool in all of Jerry Brown's California!

 - Ugh!

 Lillypads?

 - I found out there was an opening.

 Uh, the mayor of Malibu's son just disappeared like that.

 We're all praying for his safe return, of course, 

 - just not until enrollment closes.

 - JESS: Oh, my God.

 Wait.

 Didn't you guys already look at a preschool?

 (scoffs) You mean Triangles?

 (chickens clucking) Okay.

 - Ew.

 - Chicken.

 - Hmm?

 - I made eye contact with the chicken.

 He knows that I had eggs for breakfast.

 Take her.

 Take the pretty one.

 I don't think that a chicken - cares that you had eggs.

 - No!

 I mean, I kind of liked Triangles.

 Besides, are we really Lillypads people?

 - Yes.

 - I hope not.

 That kind of competitive, overpriced private school, B dash, dash, dash, dash, dash, dash, dash is the reason why I got out of teaching in the first place.

 What did happen at Banyon Canyon?

 Yeah, what did happen at Banyon Canyon?

 You know I can't discuss that until one of four civil lawsuits is settled.

 - I know, but what 

 - No further questions.

 You guys, this is crazy.

 Look at this beautiful, impressionable child.

 Lillypads is the key to Ruth's future.

 If she gets into Lillypads, she gets into Willows.

 If she gets into Willows, she gets into Harvard.

 And if she gets into Harvard, 

 - it's a b*llet train to the Oval Office.

 - Hmm.

 Don't you want Ruth to be the president?

 Of course I do, but you can do it without going to some pressure cooker that turns her into a robot.

 (in robotic voice): Meep, meep, alphabet, meep, meep, numbers.

 Have you not seen Star Wars?

 Robots are helpful and - often delightful.

 - CECE: Please don't start this again.

 You two have been arguing about how Ruth should be raised since the day she was born.

 SCHMIDT: I'm sorry, I have to.

 Okay, if it was up to her, Ruth would have been born in a rusty tub in the Ladies Y.

 I'm not letting your hippie-dippie mishegas 

 - ruin Ruth's future.

 - (gasps) This child is a genius.

 Yay!

 (grunts) 

 - Oh!

 - RUTH: Whoa.

 She does this all the time.

 Just give her a minute.

 - She'll come to.

 - Yeah.

 - I'm okay!

 - BOTH: (chuckles) There she is.

 - (Ruth thuds) Oh, my God.

 - Okay, all right.

 JESS: Ruth!

 I turn my back for two seconds and you turn yourself into a cat toy.

 NICK: Hey, Jess.

 - Hi.

 - I'm off to the bar to write.

 This is the first day working on my new idea and I have a perfect plan to make pages.

 - Okay.

 - All right, I'll see you.

 Good-bye, Mr.

 Diarrhea-head.

 - Hey, do you have my money, Ruth?

 - (groans) Then we have nothing to talk about.

 Aunt Jess, I have to pee.

 What?

 Oh, no.

 We have to untangle you.

 Oh.

 We're not, we're not gonna make it.

 I'll figure it out.

 Wait, wait, what does that mean?

 - Hey.

 - Hey, why is my baby wrapped up in never mind, she'll figure it out.

 We just came back from Lillypads and we need your help.

 SCHMIDT: We were picking up our paperwork when we ran into that supervillain/wax figure/ former best friend of mine, Benjamin.

 Have you gotten your kid ready for this interview yet?

 We got ourselves a 365 tutor, baby.

 Christmas, New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, we own this man's ass.

 W-What are they getting tested on?

 Draw a face.

 Cut a circle.

 Know colors.

 Make eye contact.

 - SCHMIDT: I'm sorry, hold on.

 - (Cece clears throat) I'm sorry, at three?

 - How could a child 

 - (playing tuneful melody) 

 Is that your boy over there playing the piccolo?

 Oh, yeah.

 That's my seed, all right.

 I had to lay down.

 At which point, Benjamin's child started giving me shiatsu.

 - Oh.

 - SCHMIDT: Which is apparently another thing he knows how to do.

 - Ew.

 Preschool tutors?

 (scoffs) - SCHMIDT: Okay, Jess, Ruth is never going to make it through this interview without a professional tutor.

 And if we look past the whole Banyon Canyon debacle, that's you.

 Eh, I got out of that game years ago.

 Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Lillypads was really magical.

 The kids wear uniforms and, you know, not to sound weird, - but they look hot.

 - That sounds weird.

 - They did.

 - I hear you, I hear you.

 They looked super hot.

 Anyway, I have to run to work, so is there any chance that you could, you know, teach her how to draw a face, cut a circle, carry out a conversation Okay, fine.

 I'll do it, for Ruth.

 - BOTH: Yes.

 - Under one condition.

 - CECE: Sure.

 - You do it on my terms.

 What?

 I'm gonna have to go on a craft run, aren't I?

 I'm gonna need pipe cleaners, glitter, glue, finger paints and six different types of macaroni.

 And that's just 'cause I'm hungry.

 Honest to God, you don't already have all of that in this room already?

 I mean (sighs) Martini time.

 I like martinis.

 You know, I would be back to writing because I'm kind of in a nice flow, but, say, do you mind telling me that really interesting story you just told me about when you bought those shorts?

 I bought 'em.

 (laughs) A-And from the start of it, when you realized you needed new shorts?

 What was going on there?

 You just looked around your house and there weren't shorts?

 Not the fingers, man, I'm a writer.

 What are you doing here, coming up on me like a maniac?

 Um, it's me, Winston.

 Sorry, man, I'm just really edgy right now.

 - All right, man.

 - Working on this thing - about Chicago, actually.

 - Ooh.

 So you know it's gonna be raw.

 You know it's gonna be personal.

 - Oh, yeah.

 - Also, it doesn't exist.

 And if I don't have 20 pages by 3:00 today, 

 - I'm gonna get punched in the face.

 - Who, your editor?

 No.

 Some guy I hired off Craigslist.

 Wait, so you hired a man to punch you in the face if you don't write 20 pages?

 Yeah.

 I have no idea what he looks like, either.

 You know, I would have punched you in the face for free.

 - Well, I got somebody.

 - Okay.

 Well, anyway, I have a real problem, one that I didn't bring on myself.

 - I'm just really slammed.

 - So, I'm a detective now and I have to testify in these trials.

 But you know I get rattled on the stand.

 Can you repeat the question?

 I asked you if you'd like me to repeat the question.

 Can you repeat the question?

 Can you have her repeat the question?

 - Let's dig in.

 - Thank you.

 When I was at law school, I-I learned that if somebody falls apart on the stand, it's mostly because they're hiding something.

 So, I guess my question to you, Detective, is: 

 - what are you hiding?

 - Nothing.

 - Nothing?

 (laughs) 

 - I have nothing to hide.

 Well, maybe not on this case, but perhaps you're hiding something from your past?

 Objection.

 Form of a question.

 Withdrawn.

 Isn't it true, Detective, that this could be the result of a guilty conscience?

 I have nothing to be guilty about.

 Ladies and gentlemen, are we buying this?

 'Cause I'm not.

 My question is about the night of January 12.

 - Wait, what?

 No, no, no.

 No, no.

 - 2001.

 Nick, that is a cold case and I won't discuss it any further.

 Well, looks like we're discussing it now.

 I was not masturbating!

 NICK: Easy, Winston.

 You just screamed "masturbating. " 

 - What are you doing, man?

 - Sorry.

 (sighs) Okay.

 Jess, we have four hours.

 (Jess exhales) What are they doing?

 - (both exhale) - What are they doing?

 What are they doing?

 What are they doing?

 What are they doing?

 What are they doing?

 What are, what are they doing?!

 We're practicing our breathing.

 Oh.

 Oh, okay, oh, well, good, wonderful.

 So, you're teaching Ruth how to do the one thing she's known how to do since birth.

 Do you want to get one of your other teacher friends to prep your child for free?

 (whispering): I didn't think so.

 So shut your souphole.

 Oh, look, it's Happy Sock.

 - Hi, Happy Sock.

 - Hi.

 JESS: See, Schmidt?

 We're not cutting circles; we're being circles.

 Right.

 Of course.

 Ruth can't hold a scissor, but now she can twirl around like a goon at a Phish show.

 Okay, well, now you're just napping.

 We're not napping, we're going on a brain exploration.

 I take that back, actually.

 Ruth is napping.

 Okay, well, that's enough, Jess.

 You're sending Ruth straight to Triangles.

 You hear that?

 (mimics a chicken) That's the schoolyard chickens.

 And they're and they're pecking at Ruth.

 And this time, they want her eyes.

 I need my eyes for TV.

 Oh, honey, don't you worry about a thing, okay?

 Daddy's gonna take over now.

 But the clock is a-ticking, so let's start with a drill.

 - No.

 No drills.

 - DRILL is an acronym.

 D: Do it.

 R: Redo it.

 I: Imitate what you just did.

 L: Learn to keep doing it.

 L: Live the rest of your life doing it.

 DRILL, DRILL, DRILL.

 Technically, that's an acrostic.

 (high-pitched): Sweet burn, Jess.

 Yeah.

 You got me.

 DRILL.

 SCHMIDT: And again.

 RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, green.

 And that is how you earn a dollar in America.

 (quietly): She's not your child, she's not your child Okay, Ruth, we're gonna do the colors one more time, and then, we're gonna move on to a section that I like to call "Get the numbers right, and Daddy will give you a stuffed animal.

 " SCHMIDT: Here we go.

 RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, Denise.

 - Yes.

 - SCHMIDT: I'm sorry.

 Uh Did you just call green "Denise"?

 Yes.

 The color's name is Denise.

 Well, I hope you're happy.

 The interview is in an hour, and now green is Denise.

 Green is whatever she wants it to be.

 (whispers): Green is whatever I want it to be.

 - Huh.

 - JESS: Green could be Denise or Juanita or Jerry.

 I just realized (laughs) - green is Jerry, for me.

 - Green is not Jerry for me.

 Are you and Aunt Jess in a fight?

 Oh, no, no, no.

 Uh, we're just telling stories.

 Uh, once upon a time, there was a fuzzy bunny who decided that colors didn't need names, and anything could be called anything, and the world descended into chaos.

 But the bunny was happy, because the bunny wasn't forced - into somebody else's definition of color.

 - Well, the fuzzy bunny wasn't really an authority, now, was she?

 Because she used to work at a school where instead of grades, they gave out rainbows.

 Bringing up the bunny's past is uncalled for in this cabbage patch.

 But the point is: I know about private schools, and the whole system is corrupt.

 Said the very fuzzy bunny.

 Until the Jewish carrot farmer brought down his mighty shovel.

 - The whole system is corrupt.

 - (door closes) - What's going on?

 - SCHMIDT: Your friend - is costing us Washington.

 - Why didn't you marry Shivrang?

 Ruth, is that coffee?

 - Yep.

 - Okay, there is a child here.

 I'm gonna take her to the bedroom right now so she can watch local news bloopers.

 I don't know why she likes them so much.

 They're bl*wing their big sh*t.

 Okay.

 All right honey, let's go.

 Bye, honey.

 Mm-hmm.

 Talk to you later.

 Bye, Ruth.

 Great job.

 SCHMIDT: Green is green.

 - You did this.

 You did this.

 - You did this.

 You did this.

 - You did this.

 - You did this.

 WINSTON: Are we still on this?

 When are you gonna let this go?

 When you come clean, Detective.

 There is nothing to come clean about.

 Wait, aren't you 11 pages away from getting punched in the face?

 Oh, just answer the question.

 Does or does not the evidence speak for itself?

 Do I need to refresh your memory, sir?

 I didn't phone ahead to warn you of my arrival.

 I just thought it would be fun to surprise you at college.

 WINSTON: It was fun.

 Well, it should have been fun.

 - NICK: A man in front of a computer - (echoes): No WINSTON: I was checking my EarthLink.

 NICK: With no pants on.

 WINSTON: You know my bottoms run hot!

 NICK: Tissues suspiciously close.

 WINSTON: They were Doug's.

 Lotion.

 One sock.

 Ashy elbows.

 Cold left foot.

 Look, why am I explaining this to you?

 You're the one who's supposed to be writing right now.

 You know what I figured out?

 You are a procrastinator.

 Said the pro-masturbator.

 You always procrastinate when something is important to you.

 And you know how I know?

 January 12, 2001.

 - Damn you.

 - You drove eight hours across the country to come see me at college, to ask me if I have seen A Bug's Life.

 - Oh - A Bug's Life.

 The weekend before your midterms.

 You son of a bitch!

 Big test, oh, yeah Focus.

 (chuckles) Oh, I got to pick that up.

 Whoa!

 It's been a while though, hasn't it?

 You should have appreciated the fact that your friend hitchhiked across the country to visit you.

 - (both laugh) 

 - You're a procrastinator.

 You want to know why you procrastinate?

 I'll tell you.

 But you didn't give me a chance to answer.

 How am I supposed to answer if not given the chance?

 - Fine.

 Answer.

 - It's a vague question.

 It's not a vague question.

 Why do you procrastinate?

 - I don't know.

 - Nick, you procrastinate when something is important to you, because deep down, you're don't think you're good enough to get it done.

 (laughing): That's the dumbest thing I've It's also that's possibly true, because that really feels like what I do when I Keep going, you're in a good zone.

 So, of course, when you actually get the opportunity to write something about your own life, the first thing you do is choke.

 You know how I know?

 Well, because for some reason, I'm your oldest friend.

 So I hope you get punched in the face today.

 I really do.

 And then maybe, you'll finally see that you are good enough to be everything you want to be.

 You masturbated one time.

 I swear to God, Nick.

 If I wasn't kicked off of Craigslist Schmidt, you look like you're gonna be sick.

 Remember, they've only been on the planet for three years.

 Oh, God.

 Is that kid reading Jonathan Franzen?

 Wow, this place is like the frickin' Louvre.

 There's a kid handing out mints in the bathroom.

 Well, then, why'd you come?

 To see your liberal snowflake - hippie trash handiwork?

 - No.

 I came for Ruth.

 And in silent protest against institutions such as this hellhole.

 But it's quicker to say "for Ruth.

 " - You are a q*eer little woman.

 - Guys, tighten up.

 All right?

 They started assessing us the minute we parked the car.

 - Xiawuhao.

 - What?

 That's "good afternoon" in Mandarin.

 Just a little amuse-bouche for the judges.

 I also brought an actual amuse-bouche.

 It's a crostini with burrata and tomato.

 Doesn't that sound yummy, Schmidt?

 Back off, Benjamin.

 Your burrata doesn't scare me.

 - (laughs) I think it does.

 - It kind of scares me.

 Ruth, just ignore them.

 You're gonna do great in there, okay?

 Feeling good?

 Meow.

 Ha!

 She just said "meow.

 " (both laugh) MISS CARLY: Okay.

 Kids, you can go inside.

 And parents, you'll be watching from a two-way mirror, which was a generous gift from a family that's too powerful to name.

 (whispers): It's Tate Donovan.

 - Oof.

 - All right.

 Let's go.

 - Let's h*t it.

 - Okay, you ready, honey?

 Remember what we talked about.

 ROYGBIV.

 Red, orange, yellow Schmidt, she's got it.

 Okay?

 You're gonna do great in there.

 You're gonna bring the heat, aren't you, Ruth?

 Ruth gonna do what Ruth gonna do.

 - Oh, dear God.

 - Okay.

 - Please state your name, sir.

 - (whispers): So I'm Winston Bottoms.



 Uh, Winston I Was Wearing Bottoms.

 Damn it.

 S-I'm sorry to curse.

 I didn't mean uh, that's I know my name.

 Let's just get that let the record show that.

 When you do your thing.

 And um I'm Detective Bottoms.

 Are you okay, sir?

 Ha.

 I'm-I'm yes, sir, I'm sorry, um My lower half has got the sweats.

 I'd like to put in a request for a wet wipe.

 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if anyone has a wet wipe, I will gladly receive said wet wipe and clean off my lower half.

 Your Honor, may I request a recess?

 Come on, Miller, churn out the magic.

 Come on.

 Let's get started.

 Let's go.

 "Nick Miller grew up in Chicago.

 "He came from a family.

 He hated Winston.

 "Winston was really annoying.

 In a lot of ways, Winston is still annoying, but" It's supposed to be about me!

 Stupid Winston, it's sup (sighs) I'm screwed, I only have six pages.

 What time is it?

 Mmm 3:01.

 3:01.

 I'm screwed.

 (groans) (laughing) It was you.

 Craigslist, bitch!

 (laughs) It was always you.

 Wow, Stuart really nailed the face-drawing portion.

 He included eyelashes and expressive eyebrows.

 Must you narrate?

 The whole point of the audio-enhanced plexiglass is that I can hear on my own.

 Oh, boy, it's circle-cutting time.

 Miss Carly is handing the scissors to Ruth.

 Ruth is taking the scissors.

 Ruth is starting to use the scissors.

 SCHMIDT: Don't tell me what she's doing.

 Actually, you know what?

 Tell me.

 Never tell me.

 Forget it, this is a disaster, we should go.

 Ruth S.

 Your circle is perfect.

 - I knew it.

 - I want to buy her things.

 I want to buy her lots and lots of things.

 Suck it, Benjamin!

 Your bouche just got amused.

 RUTH: But what if it's not a circle, Miss Carly?

 - No!

 - RUTH: What if it's a moon, and it's sad 'cause it's daytime?

 What a colossal crap of the bed.

 Ruth S, wonderful imagination.

 You just earned three tadpoles.

 - Three tadpoles!

 - Three frigging tadpoles!

 Everyone, right here.

 You know what got her those three t-poles?

 Hippie-dippy mishegas.

 JESS: Well, she couldn't cut a perfect circle without your cold-blooded demand for excellence.

 Is it possible that after all of this time fighting, that, together, we're the perfect parent?

 - I mean, look, you're sweet.

 - You're salty.

 Excuse me, she lived inside of me, ya jerks.

 No.

 No, Stuart!

 Oh That's an oval!

 Oh, well, looky over there.

 What is this?

 Huh?

 I don't love you anymore!

 Oval's for losers.

 RUTH: Hey.

 Your name is Denise now.

 What?

 No, it's not, Schmidt's kid.

 Piccolo!

 Piccolo!

 Piccolo!

 Piccolo!

 All right, I heard you.

 Too much pressure.

 He's a kid, Denise.

 - Oh boy.

 - Why is she calling everybody Denise?

 The whole system is corrupt.

 Meow!

 (kids all shouting)

 (all shouting, laughing)

 They jammed the damn door shut with a piccolo.

 Meow!

 (girl screams)

 (all gasping)

 (screaming)

 (shouting, cheering)

 (all gasp)

 Schmidt-Stain!

 Help me!

 (whispers): Oh, God.

 Losing confidence?

 Nick, what are you doing here, man?

 I came to thank you.

 I got punched in the face, and I gotta say, it set me free.

 Check it out, man.

 20 pages.

 And they're all good.

 Some of them are good.

 Five pages are good.

 - I really like the title.

 - I'm proud of you, man.

 I couldn't have done it without you.

 - Aw, stop.

 - Honestly.

 You push me, man, you always have.

 I don't know who I would've been if I hadn't have met you.

 - Chicago, man.

 - Chicago.

 Tough love, man.

 Chicago.

 - Let's go see the Bean.

 - What?

 I-I don't know.

 I don't know why I said that.

 - Winston, I came here to punch you.

 - Okay.

 Punch you with my truth fist in your guilt nuts.

 Okay?

 And I'm gonna punch your nuts hard.

 - Okay.

 - How long you been working this case?

 Long time, man.

 Months.

 And does anybody know it better than you?

 Nobody.

 Then why don't you have the confidence to take the stand?

 The problem is, is you still see yourself as that 10-year-old boy who fainted the first time you went rollerblading.

 You rolled right into Lake Michigan.

 That did wake me up.

 But you're not that kid.

 You're a detective now.

 Married to the love of your life.

 You have a child on the way.

 Unburden yourself, Winston.

 Now, I'm going to ask you one last time.

 Did you or did you not masturbate?

 I.

 Did.

 Not.

 - Damn it, Detective.

 - I didn't.

 Detective?

 Did you have intent to pleasure yourself?

 I did.

 (audio slowed): Niiiick!

 I did have the intent, man.

 But you know how it is when you're a hot-blooded Chicago teenager, man.

 - Oh, yeah.

 - (exhales) But it's over now.

 Wow.

 Man, I feel better.

 - Of course you do.

 - I feel a lot better.

 Get in here, man.

 Chicago.

 - Chicago.

 - Chicago.

 Detective, recess is over.

 We're ready for you now.

 I wanted to pleasure myself, and this man helped me get there.

 - Aw, you did it on your own.

 - Oh, no, you helped me.

 - No, you did it on your own.

 - (laughs) Okay, I did it on my own.

 - Chicago.

 - Chicago.

 I really hope the paramedics got that piccolo - out of Miss Carly.

 - Oh, I doubt it.

 The doctor at the hospital said that Benjamin will have a permanent smile.

 Like the Joker.

 You guys, I'm so sorry.

 This is my fault.

 I'm just not cut out for this dog-eat-dog private school world.

 You should have never asked me for help.

 - No, honey, it's okay.

 - It was mostly your fault.

 You guys made such a cool kid.

 I mean, she's crazy and she's strong, and she's going to be exactly who she wants to be no matter what any of us say.

 Ruth gonna do what Ruth gonna do.

 Maybe we just need to get out of her way.

 Ruth, honey.

 What school do you want to go to?

 Ugh.

 That boy is grooming Ruth like a cat.

 - (laughing) - CECE: She looks so happy.

 - RUTH: Again!

 - Chicken!

 Hey, you.

 Yeah.

 Chicken.

 - You and me are gonna be friends.

 - (clucking) - CECE: Oh.

 Well, hey.

 - JESS: You came!

 (laughs) Yeah, we wanted to see Ruth's new school.

 It's dingy.

 Daddy, come drink from the garden hose.

 (gags) Okay, guys, if I'm gonna put my mouth on a dirty rubber tube, so are all of you let's go.

 I don't wanna do that.

 - Come on.

 - I don't wanna do that.

 - RUTH: Drink, Daddy, drink.

 - Hello, Mr.

 Triangles.

 SCHMIDT: Well, ma'am, let me get in there.

 NICK: All right!

 Get the germs.

 - SCHMIDT: Here I go.

 - NICK: Drink it.

 - Drink it, Schmidty.

 - SCHMIDT: Here I go.

 Here I go.

 - NICK: Yeah!

 - CECE: There you go.

 (laughter)

 (Schmidt gags, spits) 

 - SCHMIDT: Yuck!

 - (rooster crows) 

 Triangle water is chicken water





- (camera shutter clicks)

 - This one I call "the writer's journey.

 " - Stuck between two thoughts.

 - Mm-hmm.

 Lifelike.

 Wow.

 - What the?

 - I'm sorry about that.

 - Cooper's my social media director.

 - Open your mouth.

 - You're the boss.

 - COOPER: Nice.

 - What magazine is this again?

 - Teen BeTween the Lines.

 - Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.

 - Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.

 - Oh, I'm Okay.

 - Still in the sh*t.

 - You're in the sh*t.

 In the sh*t.

 - So Oh.

 - Really?

 I guess this is on me.

 - Good.

 - I could've gone left or right.

 - NICK: Guys, let's take five.

 Or as Pepperwood would always say, "Keep your Kn*fe dry. " 

 - #KeepYourKnife 

 - (chuckles)

 Half that.

 - #KeepTheKnifeDry.

 - Hashtag.

 Oof.

 I've got to go meet with my editor.

 We're gonna talk about the latest Pepperwood.

 Oh, the one you wrote in Europe?

 He's gonna love it.

 (chuckles)

 Way more than the last book he published, Dede, the Girl with A. D. D.

 That wouldn't even keep my attention.

 - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

 Burn.

 - (laughs)

 Burn.

 You got a lot of edge this morning, sister.

 Damn right I do.

 I'm a working girl now.

 Russell and I are building libraries.

 He's got me rolling up my sleeves to make it happen.

 (chuckles)

 Hi, this is Jessica Day from the Schiller Fund.

 I'm just calling to make sure this is still the number for a Mr. Marvin Linklever.

 It is?

 I'll put a check by your name.

 When you're done with the "L" s, this is the first batch of "M" s.

 Sounds like a lot of busywork.

 You cool with that?

 - I'm leaning toward no.

 - (camera shutter clicking)

 I'm listening.

 But at least I have time to have lunch with my girl Cece.

 We're celebrating me getting this - glamorous new job.

 - WINSTON: Oh, hell yeah.

 (whoops)

 Hey, what's up, guys?

 What are you doing here?

 Check this out.

 Look what I found.

 Three Men and a Little Box Set.

 The lady and the baby.

 - I got to watch this.

 - JESS: Winston.

 - Hmm?

 - How long have you been here?

 Not long, like, three, four, five hours.

 - Something like that.

 - You don't live here, man.

 I'm doing a slow move.

 - (phone ringing)

 - Oh.

 Mm.

 Duty calls.

 (chuckles)

 It's Russell.

 My boss.

 Hey, Russell, what's up?

 What you got?

 Oh, big meeting today.

 Yeah, I'll, um I'll get some parking cones.

 - Ma'am, you're in the sh*t.

 - I am?

 Yeah, still in the sh*t.

 Still.

 Still.

 In the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, 

 - in the sh*t 

 - Hold on, Russell, I just have to crawl out of my apartment.

 In the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the sh*t, in the Cece, I was up all night trying to put Ruth to sleep.

 I'm losing my mind.

 I feel like I'm in the third act of a Darren Aronofsky film.

 - Cheers, Daddy!

 - Yeah, tell me about it.

 I'm wiped, too.

 I think I put on your underwear this morning.

 If I'm being totally honest, I wore your underpants once to a yoga class.

 Ruth, do you want to go to sleep?

 No way.

 If you do, I'll write you a check for $6,000.

 Checks!

 Checks!

 Yay, checks!

 - That didn't quite go as planned.

 - Yay!

 You know what, all I actually have to do is get to this lunch with Jess.

 - Which is gonna be really fun.

 - RUTH: Let's play patty-cake.

 Sorry to talk about a fun lunch while you're at home.

 No, look, we have a kid now.

 One of us should be enjoying our lives.

 (yawning): Yeah, you're right.

 We should enjoy our lives.

 Go to your adult lunch.

 Eat, drink, and come home and tell me of the world out there.

 Remember me to the people.

 Cece, - I-I love you.

 - (snoring softly)

 C-Cece?

 Hello?

 - Play patty-cake.

 - I'm trying.

 Nick (chuckles)

 I don't know where to begin.

 I know.

 Pepperwood's growing up.

 He's becoming transcendent.

 Unbearable.

 What is this fluff?

 You've got two chapters of Pepperwood and Jessica Night in bed eating croissants.

 They chase a feather down a cobblestone street?

 He fell in love, Merle.

 - And then he was reborn.

 - (sighs)

 And it's sweet when you think about it like that.

 Okay, I've seen this a million times.

 Your life has changed, and now you've lost his voice.

 I can't publish this.

 What?

 What are you saying?

 Pepperwood's over?

 Maybe it's run its course.

 Maybe it's time to move on to something new.

 - You have other ideas, right?

 - Oh, yeah, a ton of 'em.

 - Okay.

 All right.

 - So many.

 - Great.

 - In my computer drawer at home.

 Well, why don't you come in tomorrow, pitch me your best three, and we'll see what we got.

 No.

 I want to pitch you my best ten.

 (both laugh)

 I'm gonna pitch you three.

 Let's make it three.

 That seems (gasps)

 Hey, girl!

 Hey, girl!

 - I love that we are doing this.

 - So good to see you!

 - Celebrating your new job.

 - Two hardworking ladies.

 Work hard, play hard, work hard, play hard 

 - Work hard, play h 

 - (yawns)

 Okay.

 Let's sit down.

 I'm b*at.

 Ruth was up all night.

 Hey, excuse me, young man, could we get two glasses 

 - of Chardonnay?

 - Chardonnay!

 - And a pot of coffee.

 - We are doing this.

 We are doing it!

 (sighs)

 So, Ruth is pretty tough, but even if she's not sleeping, at least she's not still potty training.

 - Ooh!

 - (gasps)

 - What, baby?

 - It's happening.

 Okay.

 Here we go.

 Here we go.

 - SCHMIDT: Occupied!

 - Why is Daddy still in the bathroom?

 I don't know, honey.

 This'll do.

 This is great.

 Okay, and 

 (panting)

 (sighs)

 That was a close one.

 Honestly, I'm just craving some adult time.

 Oh.

 You're quick with it.

 I like that.

 Yeah.

 We're here to celebrate you.

 So, tell me about the job.

 You know, it's great.

 It's, um, you know, a big office.

 Fueling fires.

 Making a difference.

 Make that money.

 I love that.

 - (chuckles)

 - Mm.

 Okay.

 Mmm.

 Honestly, I'm probably gonna quit after lunch.

 - What?

 - Cool if we call this your treat?

 Right.

 Heroin's in the diaper pail, baby wipes are in the cabinet.

 Oh, man, she's so lucky to have three dads.

 (chuckles)

 Hey, have you seen this?

 - Come on, man.

 - These three goofballs just hid heroin in the baby's diaper disposal.

 - What a ride!

 - Winston, why are you still here?

 - Shh!

 Shh!

 - To have fun.

 Why are you here?

 (quietly)

: Keep it down.

 Ruth is napping.

 In my bed?

 You put that kid to sleep in Yes, and I changed the sheets.

 It's very clear to me what side of the bed you sleep on.

 - Busted.

 - Ruth hasn't slept in 24 hours, so I drove her around in my car.

 She told me she had to pee, so I brought her here.

 She nodded off on the toilet.

 It was very cute.

 Honestly, it reminded me of you.

 - That's great - I took 70 pictures.

 - But that's - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

 - Are you guys seeing this?

 - (groans softly)

 (chuckles)

 I just thought of it just now.

 Three Men and a Little Lady.

 One, two, three.

 We should do this movie with Ruth.

 Winston, you cannot do a movie.

 What is that goon Guttenberg painting on the walls?

 Words sound weird to me when I'm this tired.

 That ever happen to you?

 Like, Gu-Guttenberg.

 Gu - Gu - Gu - Enough, guys!

 - Gu'enberg.

 Merle hated my last draft.

 He said Pepperwood is over.

 - What?

 - I'll k*ll him.

 He wants me to pitch new ideas by tomorrow.

 You can't tell ideas to a d*ad man.

 Winston, stop!

 Nobody's k*lling anybody.

 - Okay.

 - But the truth is, I do have something new.

 And I'd like to pitch it to you guys.

 - He's tough.

 - Okay.

 - He's controversial.

 - Ooh-hoo-hoo.

 He's pro-choice.

 He's Senator Porcupine.

 Pass.

 Pa-Pass in the room.

 - Uh, question for the author.

 - No, thank you.

 Senator Porcupine how does he put on a tie?

 Good question.

 Ow!

 - Oh, geez.

 - Aah!

 - (groans)

 - Aah!

 - Mm.

 Mm.

 - I don't know.

 With-with his mouth?

 That's what I'm saying I don't have the answer.

 I mean, Pepperwood was all that I had.

 Now I've got nothing.

 I feel like I'm, like, a wood-maker who can't make any, um 

 - BOTH: Wood.

 - Wood!

 See, I don't have anything!

 I knew it!

 I got nothing!

 (door slams)

 RUTH: I'm awake!

 Hey, I think Ruth is awake.

 You think, Winston?

 Wait, so, you're saying that you're doing Russell's busywork?

 That you, Jessica Day, former principal of an entire school, is doing his busywork?

 Nah, girl.

 Nah, hold up.

 One sec.

 How's that wine and coffee combination treating you?

 My heart is b*ating really fast, but time is moving really slow, 

 - so it all kind of evens out.

 - Hmm.

 Wait, why are you quitting?

 He has a couple guys he trusts, and I just get left out of all the major decisions.

 - Typical.

 - Heads up, you're putting sugar in your wine.

 I made a boo-boo.

 Let's just No, I made a yum-yum.

 - You know what the craziest thing is?

 - Tell me.

 Every Tuesday, he has these lunch meetings with a couple of guys from the office, 

 - and he's never once invited me.

 - Babe.

 - Yes, babe.

 - Every woman has a "Tuesday meeting" they haven't been invited to.

 How many times in your life have you been excluded from something important or talked over or ignored because you're the only woman in the room?

 It was different when I was running my own company, but ever since we joined with GKM, I've had to start dealing with this male-pattern dumbness.

 (pumping)

 MAN: Ugh.

 - What is that?

 - It's a breast pump, Ken.

 I said I needed time to pump, and you refused to change the meeting, so here we are.

 Now, for the jeans campaign.

 Which one of these guys says, "I'm having fun in Toronto"?

 (pumping continues)

 So, for half an hour, they had to sit there and watch me get milked like a freaking cow.

 Oh, yeah, your nipples looked like pizza bagels in that thing.

 Yeah, they do.

 You know what?

 This is not the first time 

 - I've been left out of a Tuesday meeting.

 - Mm-hmm.

 Remember my first job in administration?

 The budget's still too high.

 You know, I think it might be the number of field trips we've been going on?

 What about the number of field trips?

 Yes, exactly.

 - Great idea.

 - I literally just said that.

 I think we're gonna need to take it out of the transportation budget.

 Here's a crazy idea.

 What if we take it out of the transportation budget?

 MEN (chanting)

: Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!

 I've been left out of Tuesday meetings - as long as I can remember.

 - Yes.

 Exactly.

 The system is broke, and I can't feel my face.

 - Is that a good thing?

 - I don't know.

 Oh, that belongs in the f*re.

 - Whoa.

 - Oh, hey, guys.

 What do you got here, buddy?

 A little room f*re?

 That seems safe.

 Oh, don't worry, I got this.

 (sniffs)

 Oh, I should've known that was whiskey.

 Oh.

 (whoops)

 Guys, please let me hate myself and everything that I have created.

 That's it.

 I have to call Merle.

 I'm gonna tell him that I've got nothing.

 - My career's over.

 - (sighs)

 Pepperwood was all that I had.

 I'm done.

 - I'm three.

 - Everybody knows that, Ruth.

 Okay, look, Nick, you're not gonna call Merle.

 (yawning): Okay, you're gonna go in there tomorrow, and you're gonna do Wake up, Daddy.

 You're gonna do an A-plus, perfect-style job.

 Nick, you have a ton of ideas, okay?

 A lot of i idea notebooks.

 - I don't want to hear this.

 - WINSTON: Here we go.

 Oh, never mind, that's a maze you drew.

 Yeah, you drew a maze then couldn't solve it.

 You went straight for the wall.

 It was a hard maze.

 This one is just a list of words that rhyme with "moon.

 " But then right away, it's "bun.

 " "Moon, spoon, loon, bun"?

 The heck is this?

 There was no other words that rhymed with "moon.

 " - "Tune"?

 - That's what I'm saying.

 I don't have a Pepperwood was all that I had.

 I've got nothing.

 You're Mr. Diarrhea Head.

 Please don't say that to me right now.

 I'm going through a thing right now, so please don't say that to me.

 I'm asking you, please don't call me that.

 Okay, Mr. Diarrhea Head.

 No, you're the Diarrhea Head.

 Okay?

 Schmidt, what would you like me to do here?

 What do you want from me?

 What am I supposed to do?

 Uh, you used to love fixing my life.

 Before (grunts)

 came around.

 SCHMIDT: It's different times.

 I got to wipe her butt.

 I got to wipe my butt.

 I can't wipe your butt, too.

 Can I get in on that?

 Never mind.

 That's it, I'm done.

 I'm calling Merle, and I'm telling him I don't have any ideas.

 Ruth, honey, will you please watch Uncle Nick while Uncle Winston and I have a conversation?

 Fine.

 Follow me.

 I'll follow you if I want to follow you.

 - Let's go.

 - Okay.

 I'm coming.

 If anyone's the boss between us, it's me.

 - RUTH: I'm the boss.

 - (door closes)

 You know something, I used to think that Nick was the Guttenberg, but it turns out he may be the little lady.

 Winston, I need you to focus here.

 We have a spiraling man on our hands.

 We just need to remind him that he has good ideas.

 Do we have any other idea notebooks?

 Because this is just nonsense.

 I read it, and I don't want to be friends with him anymore.

 Maybe it doesn't have to be his writing.

 - It could be from anything.

 - Hmm.

 - Just find something.

 - You know what, yes.

 Yes.

 Um Okay.

 Here we go.

 "All reactionaries are paper tigers.

 "In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, but, in reality, they are not so powerful.

 " - That really grabs you.

 - Yeah.

 - What is that?

 - It's, uh Mao's Little Red Book.

 The Chinese communist manifesto?

 Yes.

 Read that again.

 (whispering): "All reactionaries are paper tigers" You know what I don't get?

 When did I start thinking it was my fault?

 Is that good?

 - Mm-hmm.

 - Why am I the one who has to quit?

 Yes!

 That's right.

 You know what?

 Tell me what day it is.

 It's Tuesday.

 Tell me where we're going.

 To the Tuesday meeting.

 The last Tuesday meeting I won't be invited to.

 - Mm-hmm.

 - Add this to the agenda, you jagbags.

 That's right.

 I am drunk right now and very awake!

 Daddy got me this dress.

 Well, you know, your dad used to, uh, dress me, too, Ruth.

 - Why?

 - Uh, because he cared.

 - Why?

 - I don't really know, but he did.

 - Why?

 - Before you, I was his baby girl.



 WINSTON: Nick.

 Look what we just found.

 A forgotten masterpiece.

 You've got to hear this.

 You've still got it.

 "All reactionaries are paper tigers.

 "In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, "but in reality, they are not so powerful.

 " And that?

 That's just the beginning.

 I mean, I don't remember writing it.

 It does sound like something I would write.

 Just think about it.

 You're always saying stuff like, "In reality, they are not so powerful.

 " - In terms of the reactionaries.

 - Ha ha!

 - I wrote that?

 - Check that out, man.

 That's you.

 - That's crazy.

 - Let me take a peek at that.

 You just need to believe in yourself, Nick.

 You've still got it.

 It's powerful.

 It's v-very it's-it's powerful stuff.

 Well, I think it's pretty clear.

 I'm back, boys.

 - Whoa!

 Shut up!

 - (Nick laughs)

 I'm an awesome writer.

 - Yeah, you are, man.

 - You're v you're v - you're very you're very good.

 - You're the best.

 If I were a red shoe, where would I hide?

 - I'm going over here.

 Ah.

 - Oh, my God.

 (laughs)

 What about back here?

 No.

 (screams)

 (laughs)

 You got to be crazy.

 (quietly): Turn that down!

 Ruth is finally asleep.

 Also, what are you doing here?

 Did my wife give you a key?

 Yeah.

 For emergencies.

 What is the emergency?

 If they don't get the little lady back from England - man, they may never see her again.

 - Oh, forget it.

 If you're gonna watch that, turn on the closed captioning.

 If Ruth wakes up again, I'm gonna plotz my pants.

 - Oh, Schmidt, are you here?

 Winston!

 - Shh!

 Shh!

 Shh!

 Winston Bishop 

 - I'll do it again.

 - Shh!

 SCHMIDT (whispering): Don't do this.

 Shh!

 Please.

 Why aren't you writing?

 I was writing, but I got so inspired by the pages that you found that I drove straight to Merle's office.

 "Revolutionary culture "is a powerful revolutionary w*apon for the broad masses of the people.

 " Hey, w-what do you call this again?

 - Johnny's Big Day at Work.

 - Nice.

 I have another title for you.

 - Mao's Little Red Book?!

 - Shh!

 Please, voices.

 - Mao's Little Red Book?!

 - Voices.

 Voices!

 - You lied.

 - Shh.

 You lied to me.

 Don't look at it as a lie.

 - All right.

 - Look at it as not a lie, and then and then you're fine.

 And now I'm not just a hack with bad ideas, 

 - but I'm a filthy commie!

 - Shh.

 Please!

 And you know I'm no commie!

 I don't know your personal beliefs.

 - You don't know my personal beliefs?

 - Enough!

 Those are fightin' words.

 We didn't think that you were gonna give those actual pages to your editor.

 We were just trying to inspire you.

 Also, why do you own that book?

 You see a red book, you buy a red book.

 - What do you do with blue books?

 - Don't buy.

 - Yellow books?

 - Wait on it.

 - That's true.

 - Hi, Daddy.

 No.

 Good God, child.

 Oh my God.

 I know what we need to do.

 Goodnight, sweetheart, well, my friends are liars SCHMIDT: We were just trying To help you write Guys, you see what we're doing?

 We're doing Three Men and a Baby.

 - Winston, you cannot do a movie.

 - Can't do a movie.

 Yes, you can.

 You can do any movie except for a documentary, because those already happened.

 Harmony on three.

 One, two, three.

 Goodnight I'm not tired.

 - Knock-knock, Russell.

 - Who's there?

 - Two women.

 - Two women who?

 - Two women coming in!

 - Two women coming in who?

 We went over this, Cece that's not the line.

 That's exactly the kind of input we've been talking about.

 Russell?

 We need to talk.

 Oh, I'm scared of this energy.

 Ya best be.

 Ya best be scared.

 Is she drunk?

 Yeah.

 On four glasses of Chardonnay and two pots of coffee.

 And I'm drunk on rage!

 Knock-knock, boys.

 Open your brain doors.

 - Sit down, Cece.

 - Okay.

 Look, I've let this slide too much in my life, but no more.

 You may not want me in this meeting, but I belong here.

 - Yeah, I-I'm not sure you do.

 - Too late, Russell.

 - I'm bustin' in.

 - Work hard - Play hard, work hard - Can't keep a good woman down.

 - Play hard, work hard - Cece, sit.

 - Okay.

 - You think just 'cause I'm a woman, I can't bring anything to the table?

 Well, try me.

 'Cause I'm pullin' up a chair, - and I'm gettin' in the game.

 - CECE: Ooh.

 Okay.

 Guys, this is Jessica Day.

 Jessica, this is my divorced father support group.

 We meet every Tuesday.

 Oh, that's why you're crying.

 It makes sense now.

 (chuckles softly)

 Divorced fathers?

 Um, my dad my dad is a divorced father.

 Your kids are gonna turn out fine.

 Sort of.

 There-there might be some rough years.

 I like your choice of snacks.

 (loud crunching)

 JESS: Ugh, Russell, I know you're probably mad at me for many reasons.

 One you might not know about is that my friend did indeed get sick in the receptionist's desk drawer.

 - I just wanted to say - No, I wanted to say that this morning I was ready to quit.

 Wait, you're gonna quit?

 But I decided not to, because I know I can really make a difference for these schools if you will let me.

 I know I was wrong about the meeting, but you have to admit, you haven't given me any real work to do.

 - That's true.

 - Why is that?

 Do you not think of me as an equal?

 Because if that's the case, that needs to change.

 No, that's not it at all.

 Jess, it's just that you're new here, and I've got a lot of trust issues.

 Probably from my third wife, Jackie.

 In fact, we were just discussing it in the divorced dad Wait, I thought your fourth wife was named Jackie.

 I married two women named Jackie.

 - Back-to-back?

 - Yeah.

 They were related.

 It's complicated.

 Look, I got to make this right.

 I hired you because I feel like you're exactly the right person to get stuff done around here.

 So I guess it's time for me to just let go and let you do that.

 You won't regret it.

 - All right.

 - Also, while we're here talking, we need some tampons in the bathroom.

 Are you asleep?

 No.

 Well I give up.

 This is my reality.

 I'll never sleep again.

 Tell me a story, Uncle Nick.

 Me?

 No, no, no.

 I don't have any stories, Ruth.

 Come on, Nick, you can do it Please?

 Nick, she asked for a story.

 - Why don't you tell her a story?

 - I thought you wanted - to sleep, Schmidt.

 - I don't know how to do that anymore.

 I've pushed through.

 - My body doesn't know how to sleep.

 - All right, fine, Ruth, you want a story?

 Here's a story.

 There was once a magical bear, and he, uh I don't know, walked on a magical tightrope to Seattle.

 Have you ever seen a magical bear?

 - No.

 - Is there a tightrope to Seattle?

 Not that I know of, Ruth.

 - Ugh, this is garbage.

 - Well, what do you want from me?

 It's late at night, you asked for a story that's the best that came out.

 Weren't you ever little like me, Uncle Nick?

 Of course I was little like you.

 Don't you know anything?

 I was born on a cold, lonely street on the South Side of Chicago.

 As rumor has it, and there's no proof of this, obviously, but I delivered myself.

 It was my fifth birthday party, there was a knock at the door.

 My father jumped up, gave us all a thumbs-up, gave me a wink, then he jumped out the window, 

 - bounced up, took off running.

 - Oh, wow I didn't see him for six months.

 My only babysitter at the time was a rollercoaster at a local amusement park.

 That and a pack of cigarettes.

 (chuckles wryly)

 Being nine in Chicago is different.

 The tree fell, h*t the power line, and the power line fell right on the hobo, shocking the hobo back to life.

 - That was an amazing moment.

 - (whispers): Hey.

 I don't know, it made me question the existence of God.

 I believed entirely in fate, and it was that same fate that brought me to the woman I love today.

 Uh, Nick, go back.

 Uh, what happened to the hobo?

 He stood up, he spun around, he said, "Time to get a job," and he walked away.

 - Why don't you write it down, Nick?

 - About the hobo?

 - WINSTON: Yeah.

 - Yeah, why not?

 Oh, this is good.

 This is really good.

 We did it, Schmidt.

 (chuckles)

 (snoring)

 Schmidt?

 (continues snoring)

 (whispers): Oh, my God.

 Time to go to bed, my friend.

 Yeah, I think the coffee's wearing off.

 - I have to thank you so much for today.

 - (yawning)

 Uh-huh.

 Even though now I have so much work to do.

 Yeah, you're gonna k*ll it.

 It's gonna be great.

 I love you.

 I do love you.

 - Thanks, girl.

 - Hey, can I tell you a secret?

 - Yeah.

 - I'm not gonna brush my teeth tonight.

 JESS: Ooh, interesting choice.

 - Thank you.

 - WINSTON: Come on.

 You don't want any of this.

 Unhand me!

 I'm not even tired.

 - Go to sleep, buddy.

 - Yeah, dude, you haven't blinked in three hours.

 Come on.

 (Schmidt yawns)

 Cece I love you, but your breath is trash.

 It's like a it's like a garbage Dumpster.

 Thanks for saying that.

 We were all thinking it.

 - Yeah.

 - Shh, shh, shh.

 Time for sleep.

 You get one story.

 Take it away, Nick.

 I call this one Timothy and the Chi-Town Hobo.

 - Good night, Schmidt and Cece 

 - "What are you doing in my box?

 It's time for sleep 

 - Do, do, do, do, do 

 - "growled the hobo 

 - You haven't slept now 

 - "to Timothy, 

 - For over a week 

 - "as a muss of hair and a pair 

 - Do, do, do, do, do 

 - "of young, sad, brown eyes We hate to leave, but you should be 

 - Counting your sheep 

 - "peeked slowly 

 - Oh, good night, Schmidt 

 - "out of a 

 - And Cece, good-night 

 - cardboard box.

 " Good night "





JESS: I have to go.

 SCHMIDT: For once in your life, don't be afraid.

 (sighs)

 JESS: Can anyone help me get in the building?

 Jess!

 But I hear sounds - Come on.

 Come on, come on.

 - In my mind Jess, where'd you go?

 - Stay right there!

 - Stay right there!

 Brand new sounds - Hey, Miller.

 - Hey.

 In my mind (elevator bell dings)

 That green light, I want it - (elevator bell dings)

 - (song distorts, fades)

 Ti amo, Jessica.

 I love you, too, Ghee.

 (Jess giggles)

 (indistinct announcement over P. A. )

 - (speaking indistinctly)

 - (laughs)

 MERLE: Hey.

 Bathroom buds.

 Get lost?

 Look at those horny, horny hippos.

 I'm gay for you like that.

 MERLE: Hey, man.

 Hell of a book tour.

 I mean, Pepperwood's European sales are already spiking.

 - Hey, have a good weekend.

 - See you tomorrow.

 - I love you.

 - I love you, too.

 And that's why we're capping off six months of European romance with the most romantic destination of all.

 - A three-year-old's birthday party.

 - (both chuckle)

 Wait till everyone sees what Mama's got on her finger.

 - I still can't believe it.

 - Me, neither.

 "My name is Ruth Bader Parikh-Schmidt, and I am three today.

 " Can you say that?

 Daddy's butt!

 Close enough.

 Okay, but where is Daddy's butt?

 I got to get to the office.

 Daddy's butt has been bleaching all outdoor playing surfaces.

 You could prepare a chicken on that slide.

 Oh, great.

 Well, I got to go help one of my models.

 Ooh, don't forget the cooler.

 I won't forget the cooler.

 Mommy is so good at her job, that she has to work on Saturdays.

 Now Daddy is gonna do his job, because these braids are straight-up dock ropes.

 - Daddy, do the special braids.

 - I-I know.

 They're all honey, they're all special.

 (panting): Ooh.

 I need a break.

 Ah!

 I cannot believe I let you talk me into this again.

 But we got to finish, 'cause Schmidt is gonna wonder where I am.

 ALY: Winston!

 You rotated the mattress without me?

 Again?

 That is my job.

 Uh, baby?

 Listen, you really shouldn't be carrying that.

 He's right.

 You should listen to your husband.

 I'll oh.

 Don't eve Just don't.

 I am seven months pregnant, and I will rotate as many mattresses as I want.

 Aly would prefer that the world treat her like she isn't pregnant.

 Oh, which reminds me.

 BellyShots e-mailed me.

 - Mm-mm.

 - Our pregnancy glamour photos are ready, - and we got to pick one.

 (laughs)

 - (sighs)

 So I'm mad at that.

 I mean, how'd they how'd they get my e-mail?

 (doorbell ringing "La Cucaracha")

 - Hey!

 - Wait!

 Before hugs, we have something we want you to see.

 - Uh-huh?

 - It's a big deal.

 We got in a Vespa accident!

 - Oh - (Jess laughs)

 Look how much of my shin is missing!

 It's disgusting.

 Where'd your shin go, man?

 Feminist icons very sophisticated theme.

 At my third birthday party, the theme was hamburgers.

 Well, Ruth asked for Wonder Woman, so I ran with it, because this party has got to be perfect.

 You remember her first birthday.

 Which led to a downtick in attendance at her second birthday.

 His greatest trick was making us remember.

 So this year, I invited every three-year-old in a ten-mile radius.

 And now you can relax and enjoy your daughter's birthday party?

 (laughs)

 Yeah.

 Uh, sure.

 "Relax and enjoy.

 " - You keep me young, Cece.

 - Mm.

 Thanks.

 Ten years in marketing, three years in fatherhood and six months of planning this party, I feel like my entire life has been leading up to this very moment.

 - I'm gonna go set up the booze.

 - Oh, no, no, no.

 Booze is a last resort.

 It is shocking how much parents drink at these things.

 Last week, I saw a drunk mommy take a take a boom boom in the bounce house.

 - It was horrifying.

 - Ugh.

 If you'll excuse me, I see a little boy over there who doesn't understand the meaning of "upscale casual.

 " Okay.

 He made that Pocahummus from scratch?

 - Mm-hmm.

 - Oh, he's never going back to work.

 - Can I tell you something?

 - Mm.

 I really thought you were gonna come back - from Europe engaged.

 - Yeah.

 It would've been nice if he'd proposed, but you know what happens when we start talking about the future we start freaking out.

 If the bird's stomach's full of bread, don't give him cheese crackers.

 Can't not say it: love the nose ring.

 Yeah, it was a big mistake.

 - Huge.

 - But not as huge as the neck tattoo.

 - The what now?

 - Yeah, neck tattoo.

 I've been telling people it stands for "Justice Shall Eventually" son of a bitch!

 Is that who I think it is?

 You invited Russell?

 - My Russell?

 - Mm-hmm.

 My former Russell, my Fancyman?

 Yeah, his son's in Ruth's tumbling class.

 Russell has a three-year-old?

 That polecat doesn't stop.

 How many kids is that?

 50.

 From a hundred different women.

 - Figure that one out.

 - Russell.

 Hey, Jess.

 You look great.

 Babe, there is a helium t*nk.

 Why are you doing balloons by mouth?

 Eh, I should've said that differently.

 Because I can.

 Listen, Snail Eyes, I love that I'm bringing a child - into this world with you.

 - That is the sweetest thing That is the only thing I love about being pregnant.

 Everything else, I hate.

 My butt is sore, my back is sore.

 I spend most of my day holding in farts.

 So you're gonna have to pick a pregnancy photo all by yourself, Winston.

 I would rather look at Nick's shin X-rays again.

 I'll go to the car and get them.

 Oh, hey, Nick.

 Listen, um I need your help picking a pregnancy photo.

 They're all so beautiful.

 - I can't decide.

 - You came to the right man.

 Look skip through those.

 (chuckles softly)

 NICK: Well, there's your winner, right there.

 It's pretty obvious.

 SCHMIDT: But I will, okay?

 Very disappointing that you didn't bring a real monkey.

 What the hell is that?

 You let him grow a mustache?

 - Relax.

 It's just a mustache.

 - That's not just a mustache.

 That's a p*rn star relief pitcher.

 I gotta say something.

 - I got to say something.

 - Hey, Nick.

 Hey.

 You're gonna tell him you hate it - on his daughter's birthday?

 - What do you want me to do?

 You know he's gonna ask about it.

 Be cool.

 Okay?

 We'll practice.

 (imitating Schmidt): Neck!

 Do you favor my moose-tache?

 - I hate it.

 - (regular voice): You'll be fine.

 Okay.

 Okay.

 - Hey, welcome back.

 - Yeah.

 Thanks.

 - Good to see you.

 - Yep.

 So?

 - So?

 - (Winston chuckles)

 See anything new?

 No.

 - On me?

 On my face?

 - Oh!

 Y-You mean the mustache.

 Any thoughts?

 (quietly): I hate it.

 (scoffs)

 You don't you don't mean that.

 (chuckles)

 You've had a long journey, you need to rest.

 Let's talk again when you've had some rest.

 All right.

 Welcome back.

 (chuckles)

 All right, man.

 Because of a pending Justice Department investigation, I can't tell you why I left Banyon Canyon.

 But I can tell you European Jess is a lot more fun than State's Witness Jess.

 It sounds to me like you need a job.

 You should come work for me.

 I don't actually know what it is you do.

 God, I was a terrible girlfriend.

 Anyway, Nick and I leave for the South American leg of his book tour soon.

 In Peru, they call Pepperwood El Gumbo FederalÃ©.

 Wait, Nick?

 You're still together?

 I've been married and divorced twice since I last saw you.

 Yeah, well, you know, we haven't been together the whole time.

 We've had ups and downs, and twists and turns, but about three years ago, we figured it out and we've been together ever since.

 Sometimes it just takes dating your cousin for things to really fall into place.

 Wow.

 And you're not engaged?

 Well, we just take things day by day.

 You know, don't want to rush it.

 That's right.

 You've always had that problem.

 I'm sorry, what do you mean?

 Well, you and Nick.

 You were always terrified of moving forward.

 Oh, my God.

 Did you ask me before, like, when we were talking, if we were engaged?

 'Cause yes, the answer is yes.

 We are engaged.

 There was a ring and everything, and-and thank God, because it was the only thing holding my finger to my hand for the entire 18-hour ambulance ride to the hospital in Warsaw.

 So suck on that.

 Right, Billie Jean King?

 - This party is a disaster.

 - I know.

 Our guests have no questions for the panel.

 Wait, no, wait, look.

 - This is for anyone.

 - Mm-hmm.

 Daddy's butt?

 (children laugh)

 (Schmidt groans)

 It's just, this is the first birthday party that our daughter is actually going to remember.

 If it's anything less than perfect, I'm going to hire a professional samurai - to chop me in half.

 - That seems proportional.

 Okay, fine.

 You know what?

 You're right.

 - Let's break out the booze.

 - Thank you.

 Put some toilet tissue in the bounce house.

 Vodka Soda-Mayor.

 Right here.

 Here you go, sir.

 A RosÃ© the Riveter.

 A Ruth Bader Gin-sberg.

 I did that one.

 You two have a good time.

 Have a good time.

 All right.

 (cell phone rings)

 Oh BOB (on cell phone): Hey, bub.

 What's the holdup?

 It's been six months since I gave you my blessing.

 When am I gonna hear my daughter cry?

 Huh?

 I think I deserve to hear my daughter cry.

 Bob, I'm proposing tonight.

 I've been planning on doing it all along - when we got back home to the loft.

 - The loft?

 You visit every possible romantic proposal spot on the planet, and you pick that dump?

 Because it's where we met, Bob.

 Look, I've got a whole plan.

 I haven't told anybody.

 So I mailed the ring from Europe.

 So when we're looking at the mail, I'll say, like, "Check this one out.

 This one's from Turkey.

 You should open it, Jess.

 " You mailed my grandmother's ring from Turkey?

 I hired an Au pair.

 He was going there, anyhow.

 - A male Au pair?

 - Yes, a boy Au pair.

 Look, look, I better get a phone call tonight with the news that my daughter - has a fiancÃ©.

 - Bob I don't even care if it's not you.

 Okay?

 - So you told Russell you're engaged.

 - (sighs)

 Well, that's simple.

 I'll just tell him that I'm engaged, so what was once interesting will now become commonplace.

 (groans)

 I'm so mad at myself.

 But he was hectoring me.

 I felt completely hectored.

 Forgot about "hector.

 " That's a good word, real good word.

 Which reminds me, um, may I hector you to pick a favorite?

 Hmm.

 Aw.

 Easy.

 - This one.

 - Oh, nice.

 - (scoffs)

 I have to fix this.

 - Okay.

 If Nick finds out that I told Russell we're engaged, he's gonna spin out, and he'll tell me he's fine, then I'll get a call a week later with him on a bus, crying somewhere, and he's gonna ask me to marry him.

 And then I'll never know if he wanted to marry me or if he just asked me 'cause I lied to my ex at a children's birthday party.

 - That was a lot.

 - You know what?

 I just need to march right up to Russell and I need to tell him the truth.

 - Yeah.

 - I can do that.

 - I've been to Europe.

 - (whoops)

 I can do anything.

 - Hey, Mr.

 Europe.

 - Hey, man.

 You know, I thought you were gonna propose for sure.

 - I was waiting for it.

 - Yeah.

 Uh?

 Look who it is.

 It's Mr.

 Sun.

 I tell you, I was sure (in slow-mo): that you were gonna pop the question.

 Instead, you just sent me a bunch of Instagram pictures.

 Pasta, bread, cheese, sorts of nonsense really.

 - I mean, I get it, you're in Europe.

 - You have to know that's disgusting.

 Relax.

 It'll soak in.

 No, not the sunscreen.

 The mustache.

 Your mustache is disgusting.

 - Stop touching it.

 - I'm rubbing it in.

 You're just doing the mustache.

 Just If you hate my mustache, sir, then you hate me.

 That's not true.

 I just don't like the mustache.

 It never would've happened if I was here!

 It never would've happened!

 Don't make this about the mustache!

 (giggling, whooping)

 CECE: Schmidt.

 Thank you.

 Yep.

 Mm-hmm.

 Uh, so, Timmy's mom just started climbing a tree with some very high heels and musical chairs is turning into an adult drinking game.

 - Darn it.

 - Yeah.

 Well, at least Ruth's having fun with Maya Angelou.

 Bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish.

 Okay, you know what, maybe you're right.

 Let's get rid of the booze before everybody goes from children's-birthday-party drunk - to Winston-and-Aly's-wedding drunk.

 - -Mm.

 Groove on, before you go - (music stops)

 - Go!

 Go!

 Go!

 Oh!

 Oh, come on, man.

 You see, this is why we need a referee.

 Give me my chair!

 - Russell, I need to come clean.

 - NICK: Hey, you two.

 - Hey.

 - Oh, hey, Nick.

 - Nick, congratulations.

 - Hey.

 NICK: Thank you, thank you.

 Yeah, MagaTween Magazine is calling it "This year's longest Pepperwood.

 " No, I meant about the proposal.

 Ah, you are such a sweetheart.

 Nobody ever talks about my book proposals.

 So, thank you.

 Some of my best work.

 No, Nick, I just wanted to congratulate you on your engagement.

 The Rio de Janeiro Civic Center next month.

 That sounds cool.

 Can I come?

 - I'm in and out of Rio all the time.

 - It's sold out.

 - It's all full?

 - RUSSELL: Mm, maybe next time.

 Look, Nick, I just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you're finally getting married.

 Aw, screw it.

 Nick, I'm sorry, I told Russell we're engaged.

 - That's not cool, man!

 - No, you're Settle down!

 Settle down or I'm gonna turn off the music!

 Try playing musical chairs with no music!

 It's just chairs.

 (Winston yells)

 What are you doing?

 Hey!

 - (guests gasp)

 - GUEST: Oh, she's pregnant.

 Stop treating me special!

 Ooh whoo!

 - Nick, I can explain.

 - RUSSELL: Look out.

 (Jess yells)

 (guests gasp)

 I'm sorry, Jess, she came out of nowhere.

 - Hey, are you okay?

 - Yeah, no, I'm okay.

 I'm so sorry about what I did.

 I just, I feel so stupid.

 I was just defensive and we're happy the way we are.

 I don't want you to get in your head and think we're not happy.

 No, I don't, I'm great.

 Jess, you do not have to worry about ol' Nicky Blue Eyes.

 I'm good.

 You told Russell we're engaged, that's hilarious.

 - Friggin' hilarious.

 - Really?

 You're not in your head?

 Because you kind of seem like you are.

 I'm good.

 We cool.

 Are you cool?

 - Yeah.

 - Table for two at the We Cool cafÃ©.



 (laughs)

 This is hilarious.

 - If you say so.

 - (scoffs)

 I say so.

 Cool.

 I'm gonna go lie on Ruth's bed and pretend I'm a giant.

 (laughing)

: Like a friggin' giant.

 Wow, this got away from us fast.

 Oh, excuse me.

 Where is Schmidt?

 What could possibly be more important?

 I know why you hate my mustache.

 You look at me and see a stay-at-home father.

 Just like I look at you and see a globe-trotting author who has thrice appeared on Book TV's - Watchu Readin' with PP Jilbi.

 - Yeah.

 Have our lives changed?

 Yeah, sure they have.

 - But, like my mustache - There's no deeper level.

 I don't like your mustache because I think it looks ugly on your face.

 There's always a deeper level, Nick.

 - There's no deeper level.

 - There's always a deeper level, Nick!

 That's what I'm saying, there's no deeper level!

 There's always a deeper level, Nick!

 (door closes)

 Fine, Schmidt.

 I hate your mustache because I miss your upper lip.

 Okay?

 You happy now?

 - (door shuts)

 - No, Nick, not happy now.

 Happy forever.

 Ugh.

 I can't wait to lie down.

 What?

 Are you crazy?

 We got all this mail to open.

 Let's open it, I'll lay it out.

 But it's, like, 4:00 a. m. for us.

 And a grown woman just fell on me.

 Well, let's just open one to get the mailman off our backs.

 - Okay.

 - I mean, not that one.

 That's not the one to pick.

 Pick one that looks really cool and interesting, right?

 That one?

 Not that one.

 I'm gonna open this one.

 You want to open an appointment reminder from my gynecologist?

 Yes, of course I do.

 I like to keep track of you and what's going on with your thing.

 So just pick one that You know what, I'm gonna pick one.

 Do you mind if I pick one for you?

 Is that weird?

 I'll just pick one.

 H-How about this one?

 Oh, this one's from Turkey.

 How mysterious.

 You want to open that one?

 - Sure.

 - (chuckles)

 (knock at door)

 I'm gonna get that.

 Will you wait?

 'Cause I'm-I'm Just please wait.

 Thanks.

 Russell, what are you doing here?

 Well, I would've called, but my ex-wife deleted all the female numbers from my phone.

 Might've been nice to say good-bye to my aunt before she passed.

 Anyway, Jess.

 Uh, can we, uh can we talk?

 Uh, we're a little bit busy.

 We're opening mail right now.

 It's only gonna take a minute, Nick.

 Sure.

 We'll be opening mail - before you know it.

 - But don't open that one.

 It might have a b*mb in it.

 So Okay.

 - Okay.

 Thanks.

 - Come on in.

 How'd you even know we still lived here?

 - I just knew.

 - Ooh.

 Russy.

 This used to be Nick's room, but now it's his home office.

 Listen, about earlier today, when I lied about me and Nick Jess, I don't think I can spend another second of my day and possibly my life talking about you and Nick.

 Oh.

 Most people find us adorable, but okay.

 Come to work for me.

 I was being serious earlier.

 I've spent a year looking for the right person, and I think you'd be perfect.

 I know you're planning a trip, so hear me out.

 - I'd - Wait.

 I don't know what you do, still.

 (chuckles)

 Yes.

 I was going to cover that in the "hear me out" portion.

 I think at our kid's party, we go cash bar.

 Cash bar would solve a lot of problems.

 Yeah.

 Coach, listen, I'm still waiting for your vote for those pictures that I sent you, so Winston, just pick your favorite.

 Baby, they're all my favorite.

 Why can't you see that you being pregnant has made you more beautiful than ever?

 You know what?

 Fine.

 I'll pick one, okay?

 Oh, my God, I am beautiful.

 Mother Earth.

 Creator.

 Giver of life.

 Give that life.

 I'm a walking miracle with magic inside.

 Well, I mean, it happens to a lot of people, so it's not really a miracle, but I get it.

 Look at that body.

 And there's a human inside of it?

 - Yeah.

 - Why have you been so casual about that?

 This is crazy, babe.

 W-What are you doing just sitting there?

 Get a chair.

 Help me get off my feet.

 I've got the beginning of our family in here.

 - (sighs)

 - Baby, can I get you anything?

 - Anything at all?

 - Yes!

 Like what?

 - Everything.

 - Coming right up.

 JESS: Bye, Russell.

 NICK: Hey.

 Did he like my home office?

 Yes.

 He said it reminded him of his home office.

 Well, that's because I copied his home office exactly.

 - Uh, now onto the mail.

 - Oh, wait.

 He offered me a job.

 He's starting an education-based nonprofit and wants me to run it.

 But I wouldn't be able to go - with you to South America.

 - Who cares?

 You should take that job.

 It's a big opportunity.

 Do you want to open the mail?

 Let's just see what's inside.

 - Just open it.

 - Okay.

 I'm wondering if you'll get excited.

 Oh, come on.

 Sorry, we have to do the cake at your house.

 Someone stole all our knives.

 - Hi, Uncle Nick.

 - And a nightstand.

 Uh, I'm sorry, you guys can't be here.

 We're opening mail right now.

 Nick's really into mail all of a sudden.

 You never know what Europe's gonna do to a guy.

 Yeah, so Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

 You guys will never believe what's happening right now.

 Okay, fine, I'll tell you.

 Aly is taking a nap.

 I was watching her, and then I left, and (laughs)

 That's one big-ass cake.

 I guess we're gonna open mail in front of everybody.

 NICK: Great.

 Uh Jess, you want to go ahead?

 Yeah.

 I just want to say we really missed you guys.

 And Nick, I don't need to be married to know who we are.

 - Really?

 - Really.

 I love you, and I love our life together, and I don't want anything to change.

 And the moment that someone suggested that we weren't where we should be, I went crazy.

 Because we're great.

 And why risk messing that up?

 We don't need to get married, and that's okay with us.

 Right, Nick?

 Yeah, right.

 (chuckles)

 So, let's see what Turkey wants.

 Ah, enough of that.

 Give me that.

 Who cares what Turkey wants?

 Cake beats mail.

 We got a hungry birthday girl right here, I don't want to bore her - with foreign mail.

 - I like mail.

 Oh, you don't know what you like.

 You're three years old.

 (chuckles)

 Excuse me.

 I got to go wash my hands.

 I've been in Europe.

 SCHMIDT: Is he suggesting that he hasn't washed his hands since Europe?

 Bob, I can't do it tonight.

 (groans)

 I'm sorry, but this thing has been ten years in the making, and everything about the proposal has to be perfect.

 - And I'll know when the time is right.

 - You know what?

 I'm rescinding my blessing.

 You want to marry my daughter?

 You got to resubmit for a new blessing.

 And it better be as good as the first time you asked.

 (sighs)

 Okay.

 Bob, I am in love with your daughter, and I will be for the rest of my life.

 I want to ask her to marry me, but only with your blessing.

 All right, all right.

 Yeah, y-you got it.

 But this time there's a time limit on it.

 One month.

 You hear me?

 - One month!

 - One month.

 ALL: Happy birthday Dear Ruth Happy birthday to you (all cheer)

 - (laughs)

 - Good job, baby.

 - Hey, hey.

 - Good job.

 Never lived for nobody But I live for you Ooh Babe, lost in love Is what I feel When I'm with you Maybe it's the way you touch me With the warmth of a sun Maybe it's the way you smile I come all undone Ooh, baby It's so great having everyone back in the loft.

 I hope this never ends.

 Feel When I'm with you





So, I've got it all planned out.

 I'm gonna surprise Nick at his book reading, and afterwards, when he's on a big high, I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

 You think this is a little soon after the breakup with Reagan?

 - Yeah.

 - Yeah.

 I'm worried, very worried.

 (chuckles)

 But you know what, I wrote everything out on the plane, like what I'm gonna say.

 It's all on flash cards, some of it's in song, I would do it for you, but some of the jokes are at your expense, - so, uh - (chuckles)

 Jess, why don't you just tell him how you feel?

 You know, no jokes, no songs, just from the heart.

 (laughs)

 No songs.

 - (laughs)

 - Yeah.

 No songs.

 No songs, she said.

 - NICK: "Pepperwood lay on the ground - "in a puddle of blood.

 "Jessica Night broke through the barricades and ran to his side.

 "'Even though he doesn't have muscles, "he seems incredibly strong' Jessica thought, "as she looked into his perfect, sexy face.

 "Even now, even covered "in the blood of the man they both knew as Schmith, "the two sat in silence in the hot, New Orleans night, "waiting for the words that would never come.

 " (audience whoops and cheers)

 I'm gonna open up the floor to some questions.

 Uh, the young lady right here in the strange-looking vest.

 No offense.

 When are Pepperwood and Jessica Night going to get together?

 - WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 - That is a great question.

 (audience muttering)

 I'll just cut to it, guys.

 Uh, Pepperwood and Jessica Night will never get together.

 Never.

 (low murmuring)

 I'm sorry.

 You guys, stop.

 It's just, look, these characters, they-they are based off real people.

 A-and the real people are just fundamentally different.

 They don't work together.

 It's just never gonna happen.

 - You just got to forget about it.

 - Excuse me.

 Move on from it.

 And also, you know, Pepperwood, he blew it.

 Sometimes you don't get another chance, you know, to-to fix the mistake.

 It's just look, adult relationships are really complicated.

 So, let's hear it for books!

 All right, wow, you guys are super intense.

 Hi.

 - I'm Merle Streep.

 - I don't care.

 Okay.

 Um, I'm an editor and I publish children's books, - so I wanted - Oh, congratulations to you.

 What would you like me to do about that?

 Uh, I'm about to make a call, so - Nice to meet you, Merle Streep.

 - (line ringing)

 - Goofy name.

 Okay.

 - I'll I'll okay.

 (ringing)

 - Hey, Nick.

 - Hey, this is crazy, but were you just at my reading?

 You're not in L. A. , are you?

 No, I'm in Portland with my dad.

 - That's what I thought.

 - How'd the reading go?

 Couldn't have gone better.

 I felt weirdly comfortable up there.

 - I'm so proud of you.

 - Thanks.

 Reagan and I broke up.

 I got to go.

 Oh, my dad just sprained his thumb trying to get up off a couch.

 I'll talk to you later, Nick.

 Sorry.

 So, is now a good time to talk to you?

 Because I'd like to talk to you about publishing your book.

 You'd like to talk to me about what?

 Publishing your book.

 What are you, some kind of a-a publisher?

 Yeah, that's what my card I was trying to give you my card, but you - You want to publish my book?

 - Yeah.

 Yeah, I want you to publish my book.

 - Is this how you normally are?

 - No.

 (humming)

 (whoops)

 Babe, hi.

 Are your pants off?

 I I went to the reading and Oh, no, what happened?

 I'm so sorry I'm not wearing pants.

 Schmidt's been so busy with work, we scheduled a no-pants dinner thing.

 Do you want me to take my pants off, too?

 Oh, no, honey.

 Tell me everything.

 ALY: That's it.

 I'm all moved in.

 This is my last box and it's labeled "holiday important.

 " So, it's definitely sex toys.

 (laughs)

 Well, then I wonder what's in this box.

 It's labeled "documents.

 " Eh, it's just documents.

 (chuckles)

 Oh, no, no, no.

 That's nothing.

 - I - Wait, wait, wait.

 You have a mug sh*t of the diaper bandit?

 - With a phone number on the back?

 - All right.

 Listen, I-I wanted to wait for the right time to tell you this.

 Have you been keeping in touch with the diaper bandit?

 What?

 No.

 No, listen.

 I That's actually your dad's phone number.

 You said you wanted to find him, so I found him.

 (whispering): My dad is the diaper bandit?

 - No.

 - Oh.

 - Forget about the diaper bandit.

 - That'd have been weird.

 SCHMIDT: Cece (singsongy): I'm not wearing any pants.

 (whispering): Honey.

 - (screaming)

 - Oh, no!

 Oh, no!

 I touched one of your breasts!

 Where is my wife?!

 I can never be the same!

 (both panting)

 - Let's just move on.

 - I'm fine.

 No, it's fine.

 I panicked, and I told him I was in Portland, and now I can't go back to the loft.

 To play devil's advocate, he was just talking about characters in his novel.

 I mean, look, the character based on me is a Jewish psychopath who wears a bolo tie and eats applesauce out of a baboon's skull.

 No, he was talking about us.

 He just doesn't feel the way I feel.

 I I can't see him.

 Hey, it's me, Nick.

 In three, two - Hang on, wrong key.

 - SCHMIDT: Get in the kitchen.

 - Go, shoo, scram.

 - NICK: That was for my chest drawer.

 - Got it.

 - SCHMIDT: My man.

 (Nick sighs)

 I don't love this couch.

 Did you take the tags off already?

 It's the perfect couch.

 What are you doing here?

 Well, I need to talk to you and my phone's only at five percent.

 - Well, why didn't you - I can't find the charger.

 - It's under Winston's pillow.

 - I looked in Winston's room.

 - Did you look under the pillow?

 - Yeah, yeah.

 I - Yeah.

 I went in there.

 I - No, you didn't.

 I didn't look in Winston's room, but I need to talk to you.

 An editor wants to publish my book.

 Pass immediately and start a bidding w*r.

 I'm getting ahead of myself.

 Mazel.

 - That's incredible, Nick.

 - Thanks.

 I called Jess, but she didn't answer.

 I was really hoping to tell her about it, but she hung up on me earlier and now she won't pick up the phone.

 - What are you doing?

 - Shh!

 Shh, shh!

 (whispering): What, what, what?

 - Oh, Nick's here?

 - Shh!

 You're yelling.

 - I'm not yelling.

 - You're yelling.

 You're coming with me to the meeting tomorrow.

 (phone beeps)

 I'm picking you up at 9:00 A. M.

 - I have to go to the kitchen.

 - I'll come with.

 I'm starving.

 No.

 Where are you Come to the kitchen with me then, Nick.

 (whispering): Wait, why are you crawling?

 (whispering): I don't know.

 Just go.

 (groans)

 - Hey, do you have any - (phone beeps)

 angel hair pasta in here?

 I don't see it.

 Ooh, you know what?

 Uh.

 excuse me, I have to go to the bedroom now.

 (quietly): Jess, this is very stressful.

 I know.

 Look, tomorrow, you need to go to that meeting with Nick and you need to stay with him until I'm packed.

 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, packed?

 - I just army-crawled across your entire house to get away from my ex-boyfriend who I still live with.

 I-I can't do this anymore.

 I need, I need to get out of here and get some space.

 I'm moving out of the loft.

 What?

 I couldn't find your trash bin, so I threw it away in the toilet.

 - What'd you throw in the toilet?

 - The, uh, salami in the fridge.

 - What?

 - I didn't flush it.

 So, you're gonna have a bunch of salami floating around in your toilet bowl.

 What?

 So Jess is just moving out because Nick said something dumb at a reading?

 Nick is always dumb.

 He's the dumbest boy in school.

 I had no idea you cared so much about what happens to Nick and Jess.

 How could I not?

 I've been watching these idiots do this dance for the last six years.

 He's rough and tumble.

 She's sweet and sassy.

 It's the moon and the tides, it's the push and the pull.

 I know, it just makes so much sense.

 I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him.

 I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him, I'm gonna burst in the door, and I'm gonna say, "Nick, she loves you," and then No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

 We cannot get involved.

 Okay.

 - Okay?

 - You're right.

 - You're right, okay.

 - All right.

 Okay.

 (both sigh)

 - I should've worn shorts.

 - No, no.

 I would've looked amazing in shorts.

 I got rid of all the shorts, you nut-ball.

 You are really grumpy this morning.

 Well, I was up late last night, - talking to Cece about you.

 - For what?

 Nick, I want to tell you something, but but I can't.

 So I'm just gonna ask you this: why on earth do you think that you are so okay with this Reagan breakup?

 Reagan and I are at different places of our life.

 It's fine.

 Why hasn't Jess called me back?

 You guys are pretty good friends, right?

 But if you remember correctly, you didn't even want Jess to move in to the loft.

 Nick, why do you think that is?

 I'm pretty freaked out by sanitary napkins.

 Why don't you think you wanted Jess to move in to the loft?

 I don't know, 'cause I, 'cause I was afraid.

 Nick, you have been in love with this girl from the moment you opened the door and you first laid eyes on her.

 I have never seen you look at anyone else like that in my entire life.

 Except maybe, on a few occasions, me.

 I've never looked at you the same way I look at Jess.

 - There's been a few times.

 - I there's never been a time.

 You looked at Coach maybe once or twice like that.

 Me, several times.

 Winston, never.

 Let's table it.

 You're wrong.

 The first time I saw Jess was I was standing in her empty room, and I was looking out the window.

 - She was trying to get in the building.

 - Okay.

 Pretty hilarious.

 She didn't have her glasses on, and she was bumping into stuff.

 Will you listen to yourself?

 I shouldn't be telling you this, but Jess is not in Portland.

 She's here.

 And she's packing up her stuff because she's going to move out of the loft for good.

 Nick.

 Wait, she's gonna move out of the loft?

 For once in your life, don't be afraid.

 Ready to come in and talk?

 Hello.

 I'm, uh, Winston Schmidt, Nick's associate.

 That's right.

 Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.

 What?

 Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.

 Don't say that here anymore, okay?

 Thank you.

 So sorry I'm late, but Sadie would not stop going on about her divorce, and I was like, "Girl, can you just be quiet "and look at my vag*na, please?" The fact that we have the same gynecologist really makes me feel closer to you.

 Wait, is this all you have packed?

 I mean, Nick's gonna be here in two hours.

 - I know.

 - Hey.

 You know what?

 If this is too hard right now, you don't have to do this.

 Just give yourself some time and think it through.

 If my stuff is here, I'll just end up living here again.

 You know me; I live where my stuff lives.

 When I come back for the school year, I'll find a new place.

 All right.

 Well, if we're gonna do this, then we better get moving.

 Yep.

 My God, I'm gonna miss you so much.

 I'm gonna miss you so much, too.

 But it's just one summer.

 It's fine.

 Okay, I know, but I'm just gonna miss you.

 Me, too.

 - This is dumb!

 - It's one summer.

 - It's one summer.

 - It's one summer.

 It's fine.

 We can get through one summer.

 It's fine.

 I'm gonna miss you, like, day-to-day.

 Who am I gonna talk to every day?

 Mine, mine is this mine?

 Are you collecting things for Goodwill?

 I'm not donating things, I'm moving out.

 BOTH: What?

 Look, I'm just going to Portland for the summer to get away.

 Sure.

 You go to Portland, have a fun summer, but then what about after that?

 Huh?

 When will we see you?

 Who will your friends be?

 Who you gonna hang out with?

 Okay, think about the people you are leaving behind.

 Also, side note, Aly has my dad's number!

 - Okay.

 - Wait, what?

 - I got his dad's number.

 - My dad's name is Van, by the way.

 Oh, my God, Winston, that's a huge deal!

 - Yeah.

 Yeah.

 - Are you gonna call him?

 No.

 I can't call my dad.

 I just can't.

 You know what?

 You don't have to call him if you don't want to.

 You can always just escape to Portland Oh, my God!

 You can come with me to Portland!

 Furgie's gonna love it.

 It's the second most cat-friendly Portland after Portland, Maine, according to Paws magazine.

 - Are you going to Portland?

 - No.

 Portland is hella white.

 (phone ringing)

 Ooh.

 (chuckles)

 Sadie.

 Hello.

 (singsongy): Cece, you're pregnant.

 Oh, my God Cece's pregnant.

 Why are you picking up someone else's phone?

 Call back in five minutes, and we will agree to lie to our friend for the rest of our lives.

 Oh, God.

 You're gonna be in my office throughout the pregnancy, aren't you?

 (door closes)

 So I am double-parked, so if you got any boxes I can take down to the car.

 What's up?

 Why are you so happy?

 I just love boxes so much.

 Can I have one to take to the car?

 - It's heavy.

 - I'm fine.

 Oh, okay.

 We can go together.

 That's fine.

 I-I like quality time.

 (phone ringing)

 - Oh, you should go get your phone.

 - No, no, no.

 Let's just get this box down.

 - Okay.

 - Hey, can someone grab my phone?

 What if it's about your booming model business?

 - ALY: Hello?

 - Cece, you're pregnant!

 Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant!

 - Who the hell is this?

 - Cece's pregnant?

 Sorry.

 I-I'm Aly, Winston's fiancÃ©e.

 Cece is pregnant?

 - Winston's married to Cece.

 - Winston Bishop.

 Cece's pregnant.

 Cece's pregnant.

 Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant, everybody!

 - Oh, my God.

 - (laughs)

 No need to yell.

 Tell Cece to call me.

 Got to head back down in the mine.

 Hey, can we hustle?

 I got a hair appointment in an hour.

 It's a real upstairs, downstairs kind of day.

 Gotcha.

 (ringing)



 What, Winston?

 I'm using social media.

 Oh, my God, Schmidt.

 Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be a papa?

 No, no, no, no.

 What do you mean, "papa"?

 What are you talking about?

 - Pull the plug.

 - Sadie told Aly that Cece is pregnant.

 - Pull the pull the plug.

 - What?

 Why would she do that?

 - 'Cause she pregnant.

 - Winston, he doesn't know.

 Oh, oh, oh, no Ah No I messed up just now.

 W-Winston.

 You weren't supposed to know that, so don't know that.

 - Is that true?

 What's going on?

 - Hey, Schmidt.

 It's Jess.

 I'm so sorry.

 I picked up Cece's phone, it was Sadie, and she told me the news, and now everybody knows but Cece.

 So I'm gonna send her home.

 Okay, okay, but Jess, um Plea (sighs)

 Is it true?

 Yeah.

 It's true.

 Just get home.

 She needs to hear it from you.

 Miracle of miracles!

 Finally got a parking spot.

 Why y'all just staring at me?

 Just really happy you found that spot.

 Man, people wait their whole lives looking for a spot.

 Thank you.

 And here, you've been blessed.

 With a spot.

 MERLE: Okay, so I do have a few changes.

 Take or leave.

 What if we k*ll off Jessica Night in the next book?

 What?

 I was thinking that she could be Schmith's next victim.

 We could do it in a big way, like, he drops a piano on her head.

 - (bl*ws raspberry)

 Done-zo.

 - What?

 Maybe she takes a baseball right to the face.

 Batter out!

 - Have you ever done this before?

 - Yes, actually.

 I published the entire Bitch Witch series.

 Bitch Witch Christmas, Bitch Witch Prom Night, - and Bitch Witches of Rhode Island.

 - Yeah.

 Okay.

 Look, Nick, I-I get that you're afraid to make changes.

 Actually, I'm not afraid.

 - Okay, then you'll think about it.

 - (chuckles softly)

 No, I'm not gonna make those changes because those-those ideas are really bad.

 - Well, I - Jessica Night is the whole reason Pepperwood gets out of bed every day.

 NICK: Schmidt?!

 You were right!

 Schmidt?

 Uh, he had to go, but he left the name and number of his favorite Uber driver, uh, Beezus "The Man" Tequito.

 All right.

 Mr. Beezus.

 Mr. Schmidt likes to party.

 You like to party?

 Oh, very cool lights.

 But, no, uh, Beezus, I I don't like to party It's not the first time I've heard that.

 I'm gonna go see a girl.

 - Oh, good for you.

 - Yeah.

 Want to hear some music?

 Sure, yeah, that could be inspiring.

 Hot cross buns Hot cross buns One a penny, two a penny Hot cross buns Second chorus.

 Hot cross buns Yeah, I cannot believe Schmidt likes this.

 Good when they're old But eat them when you can They're not as good when they're cold Hot cross buns (sighs)

 WINSTON: Last box in the truck.

 Mm.

 I haven't seen this room this empty since Steve left.

 Who's Steve?

 Oh, he was the guy who lived in this room before Jess.

 Real night screamer.

 He couldn't sleep unless he was screaming a whole bunch.

 Yeah.

 Oh, I guess I should give you my keys.

 Are you really not gonna tell Nick how you feel?

 - That's such a Steve move.

 - (chuckles)

 Steve was in love with Nick?

 Oh, yeah, and he never told him.

 That sweet, gay coward.

 Maybe Steve left this place and-and and finally got the space that he needed to become a better version of himself.

 Yeah, I mean, he's selling tires in Little Rock.

 Okay, well, forget Steve.

 Look, I know I'm being a coward.

 Jess, I know you.

 You can't walk away without talking to him.

 This is how I have to move on, and I have to go.

 - Let's get on the road.

 - Okay.

 Wait.

 (sighs)

 (line ringing)

 VAN (recorded): You've reached Van.

 Leave a message.

 (beep)

 Hello, Van.

 This is Winston Bishop.

 I'm your son.

 I'm calling to tell you that I am getting married to the most amazing woman in the world.

 And I turned out pretty great, too, so, um call me whenever you're ready.

 Oh, also, I have a cat.

 He's not ready to have a relationship with you, so just don't try to force it on him.

 (phone beeps)

 Yeah, so now it's your turn.

 Be brave.

 I can't.

 I'm sorry.

 Hey, babe, I'm back.

 Whew!

 (sighs)

 What's, uh what's happening?

 I'm pregnant.

 - What?

 - I mean, you're pregnant.

 We're pregnant.

 (chuckles)

 Sadie called you, and-and Jess picked up, then she called again and Winston picked up, Winston told me.

 It's an upsetting scene, but, um, we're having a baby, Cece.

 I wanted to buy you flowers, but I couldn't pick out which ones, so We're having a baby?

 We're having a baby.

 (whispers): We're having a baby.

 I really didn't think it was gonna happen for us.

 It's a caramel miracle.

 (both laugh)

 BEEZUS: Don't forget to give me five stars!

 NICK: Three and a half!

 Thanks, Beezus!

 Hey, let's turn on some music.

 (radio stations changing)

 - Oldies station okay, everybody?

 - The time of my life I think I'd be really happy working as a mover.

 I like the gloves, I like the excitement.

 It's the truth And I owe it all to you Sit back and watch the job get done.

 Winston's right.

 Portland, huh?

 Land of the muskrat.

 - Pull over!

 - I mean, I'm in the middle - Just pull over.

 - We're in traffic and we're parked!

 I was just trying to, you know okay, I'll go up.

 I'll go up a few blocks, that's fine.

 Jess?

 (sighs softly)

 JESS (outside): Can anyone help me get in the building?!

 Hey, dog!

 Can you bark for someone?

 Bark, dog!

 Bark!

 (imitates dog barking)

 Ah!

 Screw you.

 Can anyone help me get in the building?!

 I gave away my key!

 Anyone?

 Jess!

 Hang on, I'm coming down!

 (sighs)

 Oh, hey, hold the door.

 Thanks.

 (dog barking)

 Now you find your voice?

 But I hear sounds in my mind Come on, come on, come on.

 Brand-new sounds in my mind Come on.

 But, honey I'll be seeing you Ever I go (grunts)

 But, honey, I'll be seeing you Down every road Jess, where'd you go?!

 - Jess!

 - Nick!

 Why are you down there?

 BOTH: Stay right there!

 'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things - Come on, come on.

 - But I can't let go I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Oh, I wish I could get my things And just let go Oh, come on, please go faster.

 I gotta tell my best friend I'm in love with her.

 Shower first.

 I've never seen anyone sweat so much.

 You take a shower.

 You smell terrible.

 - You smell terrible!

 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 (chuckles)

 Hey, Miller.

 Hey.

 That green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light





The dream is d*ad.

 Say good-bye to the Schmidt Charitable Trust.

 I don't know what that is.

 But is that why you were throwing light bulbs against our garage?

 - That was unrelated.

 - Oh.

 It's the foundation that I was going to establish to take the Schmidt brand to the next level, but now I can't.

 - The name is taken.

 - What?

 Get a load of that.

 The Schmidt Charitable Trust was established in 1948 by Cranston Schmidt, to promote nudity in restaurants.

 Cranston Schmidt and his naked waitresses.

 What am I supposed to do now?

 How can I show my peers that I make so much money that I could just throw it away on strangers?

 There is one way that you could maybe solve your problem.

 - What?

 - You could use your first name.

 What did you say?

 You are not a frat boy drinking at a keg anymore, okay?

 You are an executive now.

 - You're a baller.

 - I am a baller.

 Also, I was never allowed in frats.

 Too much hazing that required a visible penis.

 - Oh, baby.

 - JESS: Just do it.

 - (shouts)

 - Like, who cares?

 - How long have you been here?

 - Long enough, Schmidt.

 Yeah, we keep the camera running all day.

 I'm trying to keep Jess company while she's in Portland.

 Yeah, yesterday I watched Cece read for a while.

 Oh, wow, that sounds like fun, Jess, good for you.

 - Cece - Jess needs us right now.

 She's still mopey over Nick.

 I'm not mopey.

 I'm rad.

 I'm gleaming the cube.

 She's lying.

 She's a wreck.

 JESS: Ugh, Dad!

 Ugh, I'm on the phone!

 You're so embarrassing.

 All he does is just recycle cans all day.

 I wish his child bride would come back from Denver so he'd have someone else to bother.

 Let's just get you out of this house.

 - Yeah, right.

 - Well, what are you going to do?

 You're gonna sit on this couch all day long?

 You'll get sofa butt.

 Come on, let's go get some ice cream.

 Ugh, I hate ice cream.

 Dad!

 - Nobody hates ice cream.

 - It's stupid.

 - I-I feel uncomfortable watching this.

 - Yeah, it's stupid, Dad.

 It's so stupid.

 - Hey, Cece.

 - Dad.

 Hi, Schmidt.

 How are you?

 Dad!

 Don't talk to my friends!

 (Nick clearing throat)

 Achoo!

 (shushes)

 (clears throat)

 - Oh, you're up.

 - You woke me up.

 Hey, do you mind if I run something by you that's very personal, very hot button?

 I do I need to rest.

 - I'm working nights this week.

 - Oh, as a police officer?

 No, Nick, as a prost*tute.

 Yes, as a cop.

 Now will you please leave my room?

 I'm very tired and I need to get some rest.

 I understand, but here it comes, I have to tell you.

 - I don't want to hear it.

 - Aly, I'm gonna tell you.

 - I swear to God.

 - I need to break up with Reagan - but I don't know how to.

 - Damn it, Nick.

 Oh, now you're involved.

 So now that you're involved, we need to talk it out 'cause we're basically partners in this.

 - We're not partners.

 - Things with Reagan and I haven't been working out, and last night it really came to a head.

 It's just crazy.

 You know, - I was just driving down the - Mm-hmm.

 Sounds crazy.

 - Reagan.

 - Yes?

 I worked all day.

 We haven't seen each other.

 Don't you want to catch up?

 (sighs)

 Yes.

 (clears throat)

 Fine, what?

 What happened to you today?

 I saw a seagull in the backseat of a moving car.

 Can we have sex now?

 Ugh, you don't get it.

 Let's get it over with.

 What does this have to do with me?

 I was hoping you'd tell me how to break up with her.

 Just pretend you're an adult - and get it over with.

 - Yeah.

 Train's already left the station, Nick.

 The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.

 The train already left the station, huh?

 - Yep.

 - Thank you.

 You're welcome.

 Hey, say, wake up.

 Question.

 Excuse me.

 Yes, Nick?

 Do you think that looks like a monster's butthole?

 I kind of do, yeah.

 Yeah, me, too.

 It's really gross.

 What's going on, Schmidt?

 Man, are you having trouble ordering from that Jamaican restaurant again?

 I don't know how many times I got to tell you.

 Don't walk in there using their accent 'cause it's kind of r*cist.

 The time has finally come for me to launch my own brand.

 - Are you really not gonna turn around?

 - Not yet.

 This brand will be my legacy.

 And this is where you come in.

 Ooh!

 You had that timed right!

 I'm going to start using my first name again.

 Schmidt, I think that is a very bad idea.

 I have no choice!

 When I was born, my parents gave me a name.

 Don't do this, Schmidt.

 Ain't nothing but pain down that road.

 It is the name that I was called for most of my life, and I want my name back.

 Isn't this fun?

 Remember, we used to come here all the time, every time you won a tennis match.

 - That was your other daughter.

 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

 You-You were always in a production of Annie, but never Annie, though.

 Priscilla, come here, come here.

 I want you to meet my daughter, Jessica.

 Remember?

 I told you about her.

 She's the one that doesn't play tennis.

 Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.

 (laughs)

 Well, two rum raisin sundaes and whatever my daughter wants.

 (Priscilla and Bob laugh)

 You.

 (laughs)

 (quietly): Her husband fell down a spiral staircase.

 - What?

 - He kept falling, falling, continually falling.

 It was awful.

 He didn't die.

 But when he found out that he had become a viral sensation - he k*lled himself.

 - Ugh.

 I know how he feels.

 Jess, are you still upset about Nick?

 You got to, you got to move past that.

 It's hard.

 You don't know what it's like to be alone.

 I do know what it's like.

 - Ashley and I broke up.

 - What?!

 - Yeah.

 - When?

 Yeah, about six months ago.

 Uh, but I-I didn't want to worry you.

 Dad.

 It's my job to worry.

 Was it the 40-year age difference?

 Were you tired of waiters just asking again and again if it was a daddy-daughter dinner?

 Sorry, no, that's not REAGAN: You said that the pill sold itself, so let me ask you, is the pill a cure for a kick in the b*lls?

 Because you're gonna need it.

 - Oh, no.

 - Hey, Nicky, what's up?

 Uh, I can wait.

 No, it's okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.

 I want to tell you (mouths)

 - What?

 - I said what I needed to say.

 Nothing came out of your mouth.

 I feel like we're on a train.

 Where are we going?

 We're going to San Diego.

 - What?

 - I panicked and it just came out.

 Let me tell you something, sister, your plan didn't work.

 This wasn't my plan.

 Well, you brought up trains, didn't you?

 And you got in my head.

 San Diego part?

 Well, that's on me.

 I'm not engaging with you over this.

 - So, what do we do now?

 - I don't know, Nick.

 I've never experienced a person trying to break up with someone, and instead inviting them on a beach vacation.

 I didn't do this on purpose.

 I feel like you led me here.

 - This is not on me.

 - So what do you want me to do?

 You want me to go break up with her down in San Diego?

 I don't, I don't care at this point.

 - Why?

 Because it's private?

 - Live your life, man.

 Because the weather is really nice?

 And what happens if it doesn't work out?

 I'm just gonna go move down to Mexico and start a new life?

 No one's suggesting any of this.

 You're a genius.

 (laughs)

 Thank you, Aly.

 I knew I came to the right person.

 I'll do it.

 That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I feel like I should call San Diego to warn them about you.

 But you seem convinced, so if it gets you out of here faster, God bless.

 - Do you believe in God, Aly?

 - I believe in hell and I'm in it.

 - Oh, this is hell?

 - Yes!

 Then why don't you stay out of my business?!

 That's all I'm trying to do, but you keep bringing me your business!

 Ah, to hell with you!

 We're going to San Diego!

 - Fine!

 - Fine!

 - Go!

 - I'm going!

 Don't say anything.

 I should have known right from the start.

 On our honeymoon, we're in the ocean, a-a-and Ashley sees a shark coming towards us.

 You know what she does?

 She pushes me in front of it and says, "Eat him! Eat him!" 

 - What?

 - That-that was a clue.

 - That was a clue.

 - I just hate thinking of you all alone in that house.

 I'm fine.

 I got my cans.

 Gets me out of bed in the morning.

 - What if you met someone new?

 - Oh, no.

 - JESS: Really.

 - BOB: Aw, no.

 Dad, what about 

 - what about Priscilla?

 - What?

 - What?

 Come on.

 - No.

 No.

 I'm an old man.

 She doesn't want an old man.

 Look.

 I've got a Band-Aid on my hand.

 Not on the finger, the hand.

 That is an old-man thing.

 Okay.

 Hey, Priscilla.

 Oh, no, no, no, no.

 Hi.

 I was wondering if you would like to get a decaf coffee and talk about local news with my dad.

 Really, Bob?

 You want to take me out?

 - Ha, ha, ha, you - (laughs)

 Let's do it.

 Let's do it.

 Yeah, I have a new jean jacket I've been wanting to break out.

 It's stone-washed.

 BOB: Okay.

 Okay.

 Well, that was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.

 Even though this morning I thought you were married.

 What about you?

 I'm supposed to be cheering you up.

 You did cheer me up.

 You got me off of the couch.

 It's good to be out of the house.

 You kids have fun.

 Okay, thanks.

 So this is a surprise.

 Where do you think we should go?

 Where do you think we should go?

 Look, Schmidt, we both know there's only room for one Winston.

 And we found that out the hard way, didn't we?

 Homecoming weekend, 2002.

 - I'm Winston!

 I'm Winston!

 - I'm Winston!

 I'm Winston!

 We can't live like this!

 - Only one Winston.

 - Body slam!

 Get off!

 Get off!

 You'll k*ll him!

 We have tried every single variation.

 Fat Winston, Thin Winston.

 Too derogatory.

 Black Winston, Jew Winston.

 Obviously problematic.

 Hot Winston, Ugly Winston.

 Now that nearly tore us apart.

 Which is why we came up with the one-Winston rule.

 Yeah, but those were angry times.

 Let's make it double W's.

 (exhales)

 Welcome back, Winston.

 It's good to be back, Winston.

 - REAGAN: San Diego.

 - The wonderful San Diego.

 - Where are we staying?

 - Not sure.

 Maybe we're gonna get the nicest hotel in the city, huh?

 Maybe you're gonna stay there, and maybe I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles today.

 I'm gonna stay in San Diego, and you're gonna go back?

 Who knows what's gonna happen down there?

 That's the fun of a trip like this.

 Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna m*rder me, right?

 No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.

 What is wrong with you?

 - What is wrong with me?

 - Yeah.

 The guy taking you to San Diego the Paris of Southern California?

 - Okay.

 - You're losing it.

 I'm acting totally normal.

 You need a drink just to chill out.

 - What is wrong with you?

 - Getting those drinks.

 MAN (over P. A. ): This stop, Anaheim.

 (mouths)

 (train horn bl*ws)

 (mouthing)

 You should have seen him.

 The only time my dad gets that nervous is when he doesn't know where to print out his boarding pass.

 It's so weird to think of him dating again.

 - BOB (moaning): Oh!

 Oh - Wait.

 What is that?

 It sounds like someone's moving a washing machine.

 Oh, my God, my dad's boning!

 - My dad's boning!

 My dad's boning!

 - Oh, my God, listen to me.

 Get out of the house.

 Get out of the house!

 (cans clattering loudly)

 - BOB: Jess?

 Is that you?

 - No.

 Yes.

 I mean, no, it's the cans.

 I just, um Finish what you're doing.

 No, don't finish.

 I mean, everyone deserves to finish oh, God!

 - (cans clattering)

 - Oh, cans!

 - Can we talk about this?

 - Yeah, just one sec.

 I'm just replacing the sound of your skin slapping against someone else's with the sound of crushing metal.

 I didn't know you were gonna be home.

 I thought you were gonna be out having a day.

 And you were supposed to be having coffee.

 You just put out on the first date?

 We had a connection.

 I-I think I'm in love with her.

 Oh, my God, I need more cans.

 I got to have more cans.

 Hey, you know, I'm a passionate guy.

 - All right.

 - What are you doing, Dad?

 Well, I mean, you were nice enough to help me to move on.

 Now I'm gonna see if I can find somebody for you.

 Got it.

 My best friend Ray.

 His son John.

 Well, he's a little heavyset, but, you know, he makes a good living.

 Dad, put the Rolodex down.

 Look, we're not in the same boat, okay?

 I can't move on.

 I love him.

 Nick?

 What do you see in him?

 I mean, he looks like the only white waiter at a Chinese restaurant.

 There isn't a logical explanation, but it is what it is.

 I love him.

 I wish I didn't, but I do.

 - Come here.

 - Dad, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the recycling plant.

 It closes in an hour.

 From now on, I will be Winston Schmidt, and he will be Winston Bishop.

 We are both Winstons.

 Wait, your first name is Winston?

 - Did I know that?

 - No.

 I have not slept in 36 hours.

 Well, you should get some sleep.

 - Isn't that right, Winston?

 - Oh, absolutely, Winston.

 Sleep is very important.

 It is the most important, Winston.

 Okay, this is already too much.

 In my head it wasn't this annoying.

 Winston, why don't you just go by "The Bish"?

 - I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

 - You know I'm talking to you.

 I knew she was talking to you.

 - You knew the whole time?

 - Yeah.

 Ooh, I couldn't tell.

 Wait a minute, why does Winston - Yes?

 - Oh, my God.

 Why does my Winston have to change his name?

 - Schmidt, don't you have a middle name?

 - I do have a middle name.

 - It's Saint-Marie.

 - Hmm.

 - And obviously I can't go by that.

 - That's hilarious.

 Oh, hello, hello!

 Wait, what are you doing here?

 Oh, well, I couldn't break up with Reagan, - so I jumped off the train.

 - Hmm?

 - Problem, problem solved.

 - What's up with you guys?

 - Why didn't I know about this?

 - I don't know, Schmidt, 'cause you weren't around, I guess.



 Well, actually, I'm Winston now.

 I'm using my first name again.

 Uh actually there can't be two Winstons.

 It nearly destroyed us.

 Nick, hold up, can we go back to that moment where you jumped off a train?

 Sure.

 You find that part interesting?

 Okay, I don't care about the answer, but I feel like I got to ask, as someone who works in law enforcement where is Reagan?

 Well, she's probably getting off at the next stop, and then she'll be on her way here for some sort of a reckoning, I would imagine.

 "Problem solved" was probably a bit of a, an overstatement.

 The good news is that I don't have to break up with her 'cause now she's gonna break up with me.

 - Oh, Nick.

 - What is wrong with you?

 It's gonna be okay, Nick.

 Give Winston a hug.

 - Come on.

 Here we go.

 - Here you go, Winston.

 I meant "me Winston.

 " - I'm "me Winston," too!

 - Hey, guys!

 Reagan's on her way.

 I've got too much to deal with to deal with this two Winstons thing.

 What, I can't have a first name because you left some woman on a train?

 Don't put that on me, man!

 I'm not calling you Winston, Schmidt.

 'Cause if I do, then what am I gonna call the real Winston?

 Call him I don't care!

 I don't care!

 - Hey, Winston, you want to get a drink?

 - Sure.

 - I'm down.

 - I was talking to that Winston.

 - Oh.

 - After the drink, you want to get some dinner, Winston?

 - Ooh, you know your boy hungry.

 - Yes.

 That time I was talking to this Winston.

 - So, I can come if you want.

 - I'm down to go.

 No, I'm trying to figure it out, okay?

 Wait, time out.

 Are we eating, or are we not eating?

 They're both real Winstons, but the old Winston is now The Bish.

 I'm not calling my fiancÃ© "The" anything.

 Nah, man, this is taking me to a bad place.

 - I'm having I'm having cold feet.

 - What?

 Yeah, the two Winstons thing is not gonna work Nick is right.

 You've had Winston for 15 years.

 It's my turn.

 I'm Winston.

 You will never be Winston.

 - Oh, you want to dance?

 Yeah.

 - Oh, yeah?

 Okay.

 - Come on.

 - Come on.

 Come on.

 - Okay, what is happening?

 - WINSTON: Come on.

 - SCHMIDT: Come on.

 - I used to live by myself.

 - Come on.

 - Come on.

 I had covered parking, I was happy.

 - I'm Winston.

 - Guys, no.

 It's not about you, man.

 I am Winston.

 Shut up!

 I'll k*ll you!

 I'll m*rder you!

 NICK: I can't do this right now.

 I got too much on my plate.

 - I'm Winston.

 - I'm Winston.

 - Nah, I'm Winston.

 - Ah, I'm Winston.

 Yet, somehow, all the Michaels in the world manage to deal with this every day.

 Mm-hmm.

 Go to sleep, go to sleep.

 (phone rings)

 - Hello?

 - Mr.

 Day.

 It's Nick Miller.

 - Is Jess there?

 - She's out.

 Can I take what I assume will be an idiotic message?

 Ah, it's actually, it's kind of private.

 Okay, fine.

 Talk to you later.

 Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

 I'm breaking up with Reagan and it didn't quite go as planned.

 I'm, I'm in a really bad situation and Jess always says the right thing and I, I really need her.

 Let me, let me ask you a question.

 You're in the ocean with Jess, and a shark starts coming towards you.

 - What do you do?

 - Which ocean?

 I-I don't know, Pacific.

 - What type of shark?

 - What the hell difference does it make?

 Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.

 Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing if not, it definitely should be.

 It's just a regular shark.

 You know what?

 Good-bye.

 Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me, I'm sure I'm sure we'd be okay.

 She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and she's just the greatest person I have ever met.

 Bob?

 Does that answer your question or what?

 It does.

 Weirdly enough, it does.

 But I also don't accept your weird-ass premise, man, 'cause it's absolutely preposterous - REAGAN: Nick.

 - NICK: Oh, my God.

 She's here.

 Nick.

 Nicholas, I can see you.

 Hey.

 How was San Diego?

 Hey, so Reagan's in your room, packing up her stuff.

 What'd you say to her?

 Nothing.

 I-I didn't say anything.

 I just, uh, crawled out from under the bed where I was hiding.

 She said, "It's over," which makes sense, and then I came in here, and this is now my fifth beer in as many minutes.

 - I'm impressed.

 - No, you shouldn't be.

 I once drank nine beers in five minutes.

 I hear that cry for help, but I meant the breakup.

 You ended a relationship without any confrontation.

 You got what you wanted.

 Then why do I feel so terrible?

 Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.

 Right.

 I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.

 But I'm also glad you were here 'cause I feel like we bonded.

 It was one of the most frustrating days of my entire life.

 I'm exhausted.

 I feel like a single mom in a mop commercial.

 Welcome to the loft.

 Hey.

 Taking a little trip?

 I hear San Diego's lovely.

 I regret that.

 I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.

 You deserve better than that.

 The truth is, is I wanted to break up with you, and I didn't know how to.

 Okay.

 I mean, I'm not mad anymore, more just scared of what it must be like to have to live inside of your head.

 Look, I'm sorry.

 It's okay.

 I've been thinking about breaking up with you for a while.

 So, we just wanted really different things.

 I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.

 I'm not good at good-byes either.

 I think I'm gonna go stand in the closet for a little bit.

 Okay.

 - Okay.

 - Okay.

 Bye, Nick.

 Yeah, bye, Reagan.

 What do you want?

 To be your friend.

 If you need the name Winston to get you to where you're going, then I'm not gonna stand in your way.

 You're a good friend.

 Uh, uh, what will I call you?

 Well, I was gonna give Saint-Marie a whirl, but then I was like, nah, that's a girl's name.

 And I thought about Two-Shoes.

 - Two-Shoes.

 - Two-Shoes, yeah.

 But then, in certain shoes that I have, I have three of them, so so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.

 Come here.

 Thank you, The Bish.

 Thanks, Winston.

 Hey, you know what?

 Why don't you come on inside Very weird.

 Strange man.

 I love Wednesday nights.

 And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.

 I love you, Cece.

 I love you so much, Winston.

 Oh, God.

 I don't like it!

 I don't like it!

 I don't like it!

 - Damn it!

 - Ugh Take your name back.

 SCHMIDT: I don't want it.

 - What's wrong with the name Winston?

 - It's horrible, just take it back.

 Worst name in the entire history of names.

 What'd you say about my name?

 Stop.

 N You know what, I don't care.

 Come on.

 (shouts)

 Cha-ching.

 Hey, hey, Jess!

 Jess!

 I've been trying to call you.

 I-I talked to Nick.

 - What?

 - He called looking for you, and you know, oddly, I-I see what you see in him.

 It doesn't matter.

 He has a girlfriend.

 He and Reagan broke up.

 And you know something?

 I don't even think he realizes it, but he's still in love with you.

 (grunting, shouting)

 I got you, I got you!

 I got you!

 Got your arm!

 I'm gonna break it.

 WINSTON: Aah, that's my arm!

 I need it, I need it!

 It's only a matter of time before life begins You talk to a stranger and suddenly you're friends There she goes.

 Off to college.

 Circle of life.

 Okay.

 Before you even learn to break or bend (sighs)

 This is right.

 I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna profess my love to Nick.

 - I'm very proud of you, sweetie.

 - Thanks, Dad.

 I'm proud of you, too.

 You really just humped your way right into things, didn't you, Priscilla?

 - I kinda wanted the front seat.

 - I called it.





Jess, are you okay?

 Honey, you just fled to your dad's house in Portland.

 What I did was a very tasteful, very understated skedaddle so I could get some much needed space from Nick, and it worked.

 I'm fine.

 - So, you're coming back?

 - I would, but Ashley's out of town, and the man doesn't do well without his wife.

 I can't in good conscience leave my elderly father here without someone to help him steam-clean his bowling trophies.

 Hey, Jess.

 I think you should go home.

 Shut up, TV!

 That was the TV.

 - Hello?

 - Go home?

 I just got here.

 And I-I love that.

 I love a surprise visit for no reason at all.

 We had fun, but don't you think it's now, it's time for you to, you know, get back to your life.

 Dad, you still need me.

 I mean we really half-assed those trophies!

 What?

 Th-they look great.

 Look.

 Oh, this one.

 This one is fantastic.

 See this one?

 This is the ball that I won that trophy with.

 This ball right here.

 Helen, I call - Oh!

 Dad!

 - (screaming)

 I-I waxed the holes.

 You waxed the holes?!

 Was I-I not supposed to?

 Not wise!

 Not wise!

 - It's okay.

 - (whimpering)

 I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.

 (grunts)

 Oh, I'm so nervous to meet your mom.

 I'm bad with women and family.

 I wish she was a male stranger.

 NICK: You guys talking about Charmaine?

 - Yeah, my mom.

 - Charmaine is a tough lady.

 My mom is just protective, okay?

 My dad walked out on us when I was a baby.

 - I am her only son.

 - Hey!

 What are you guys doing here?

 - Rude.

 - What are we doing here?

 Yeah, what are you doing here?

 - Why are you here?

 - What, just because we moved, we have to justify our presence here?

 Well, you don't live here, so We're allowed to be here for no reason at all.

 Oh, I get it.

 You're sad and lonely in your new house and you miss us.

 We do not need this.

 If anything, you-you people need us.

 We are married homeowners.

 Benefit from our wisdom.

 Okay!

 I got to go.

 Aly and I have an invited guest to plan for.

 - Oh.

 - NICK: Good burn, Winston.

 - You're getting better at those.

 - Thanks, man!

 Okay, I am off to my drug party.

 Reagan's, uh, pharm rep crew is in town for a convention.

 Have fun.

 If you get too drunk to drive, call me, 'cause I will be, too, and we can be twins.

 Wait, you're not going?

 Don't you want to meet Reagan's friends?

 Mm, we never really talked about it.

 Seems like something that a married homeowner should weigh in on.

 How could you not talk about such a major relationship step?

 Ugh, because we're not all couple-y like you guys are.

 We don't talk about every little tiny We don't gab all day like a couple of Italian grandmas hanging their laundry.

 SCHMIDT: Talking is the lifeblood of a relationship.

 - Truth.

 - The problem is, is neither one of you wants to take the initiative.

 You're both communication bottoms.

 One of you needs to be the top.

 What does this have anything to do with hamburger buns?

 Look, we do things in our own way, right?

 It's not like I don't want Nick to come with me.

 And for the record, I would love to meet your friends.

 - That would be great.

 - So All right, I'm going!

 Get off my back!

 So what are you guys doing here?

 - Never.

 Never in my entire life.

 - Okay.

 - Never.

 Never.

 - My blood built this loft.

 Maybe as an icebreaker we tell your mom about the time we actually arrested Jay Leno for jaywalking.

 One small thing it's a footnote, really my mom don't know I'm a cop.

 What?

 - Winston, why?

 - She's a-a protective single mom.

 She's always freaked out at the tiniest thing.

 My baby!

 I turn my head for one second.

 Lord, where is my baby?!

 - Wh 

 - I went to look at bikes.

 Oh!

 She still thinks I'm in sports radio.

 I still record shows for her.

 You got to promise not to blow my cover.

 - Wait, what are you doing?

 - I have so much police stuff.

 Now, I realize you're getting caught up in a lie against your will, but my mom is coming to see you.

 Okay?

 It won't even come up.

 But if it does, you're my producer.

 - Bishop!

 - I'm-a hide that.

 I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him Pretty slim pickings at the drugstore.

 All I got was, uh, Freckle Me Once: The Unauthorized Lindsay Lohan Story.

 Anyway, I got all your stuff your bandages, your hydrogen peroxide, your gummy peaches You're making too big a fuss out of this.

 I mean, I've had so much worse.

 This is just a bruised toe.

 It's your index toe.

 Very serious.

 That's the toe you point with.

 You've been great to me.

 You've taken care of me.

 Now I'm gonna do something for you.

 I'm gonna get you a ticket.

 Oh, here it is.

 Portland to L. A.

 Dad, I am not leaving you like this.

 Recovery is the most vulnerable part of the process, and this house is full of stairs and sharp corners.

 And you know how slippery your bathtub is.

 I won't stand up!

 I'll just roll out!

 Dad, I'm sorry, but I need to show you a little tough love.

 Get in bed.

 Do it.

 "She was born on the freakiest of Fridays" Okay, we're in 42 markets, big show coming up - with Stephen A's brother Stephen B.

 - B.

 our lead-in is a cooking show - called The Ugly Dumpling - So funny.

 Hey, is all of this necessary?

 That's just in case it comes up.

 Which, like I said (chuckles)

 it won't.

 Mm I feel like it might.

 - Mother-in-law troubles, huh?

 - What?

 - Second mom drahm?

 - Hey, seriously why are you still here?

 That's your most pressing question right now?

 Not why did I sign up for this ill-advised talk radio alternative reality?

 Guys, we're trying to prep, okay?

 So if you're gonna be in our home, please, step back from the mic.

 That's radio lingo for when someone's on the microphone and you don't want them to be; - you say, "Step away from" - I got it.

 CHARMAINE: Baby!

 You are a radio personality!

 You just can't leave your front door open for any ol' Menendez brothers to walk into.

 - Ooh!

 - (chuckling)

 (grunts, chuckles)

 - This is Aly.

 - Hey!

 Long time listener, first time visitor.

 - Oh.

 (chuckles)

 - (chuckles)

 Radio.

 She referenced radio.

 Uh, yeah, Mom, you know, we talk about work all day long, so Well, it's not work when it's with your girl.

 Now, Aly, tell me, do you two ever sing the call letters to each other to fall asleep?

 Mm, mm-hmm.

 Yep.

 KQWP Oh, I thought you two moved.

 (whistles)

 Whoa, drug companies have a lot of money.

 Well, this is great.

 I feel like you finally brought me to your home planet.

 Yeah.

 I'm really glad you came.

 All right.

 So tell me about these pharm reps I'm about to meet.

 I mean, I don't know what I can really tell you about them.

 We sort of became friends at these conventions, and we go from city to city with each other.

 It's kind of like camp friends?

 Except everybody's, uh, slept together a whole lot.

 It's exactly like camp friends, I guess.

 All these people have had sex with each other?

 - Mostly, yeah.

 - Mostly.

 And with you?

 You had sex with the yeah?

 - Why wouldn't you?

 - Yeah.

 Oh, you guys are like groupies, but for yourself.

 I dig it.

 Are we gonna have to, like, talk this out right now?

 Or - I'm good.

 Are you good?

 - Yeah.

 - I'm cool.

 - Okay.

 Ah, I'm not a talker.

 Talking's not my thing.

 Great.

 This is why we work.

 'Cause we're not like Schmidt and Cece.

 We don't have to write each other a love poem every time I go into the other room.

 - Oh, pass.

 - JACK: Reags.

 - Hey.

 - Hey.

 - How are you?

 - Oh.

 - Oh.

 - (laughs)

 Off the ground.

 - Jack.

 - I'm Nick, and I-I might win a raffle tonight.

 (laughing)

 So, Reagan, you gonna save me a pas de deux tonight?

 Okay.

 (laughter)

 What's going on?

 What are you guys laughing at?

 I don't get the joke.

 Well, you do know that she was a professionally trained ballet dancer?

 You never told me you were a ballerina.

 I sort of shattered both of my ankles in this thing I refer to as "The Crackening.

 " Your ankles?

 Like, both your ankles?

 And both of my knees and a little bit of my pelvis.

 What?

 I could be the Queen of Egypt and your mom wouldn't know, because all she wants to do is talk about the radio show that doesn't exist.

 That's on me.

 Maybe I should have made my fake radio show less intriguing.

 It's 7:12 and you know what that means.

 Traffic on the 12 with Linda.

 (clears throat)

 (higher voice): It's just way too much damn traffic out here.

 I can't get to work.

 (laughs)

 Linda.

 Your big ass on the bus, stop playing.

 Babe, how will I ever break through to your mom if I keep lying to her?

 This is crazy.

 - That's on me, too.

 - I know it's on you.

 You're the only person it could be on.

 - And that is my bad.

 - I know it's your bad.

 Aly.

 You have seven identical stripe long sleeve shirts?

 Yeah.

 I-I know it's strange.

 Um, it-it was a deal.

 - Buy five, get two free.

 - Oh.

 - You still got the receipt?

 - Of course I do.

 BB Taxx has the same items, four for $20.

 Wait.

 Are you a DDS?

 DDS since '73.

 What?

 Are you both secret dentists?

 CHARMAINE AND ALY: Deep discount shoppers.

 - OG price, $350.

 98.

 - Ooh.

 - BB Taxx price, - Uh-huh.

 - $72.

 99 - CHARMAINE: Ooh.

 - $72.

 99!

 - Ooh.

 And someone didn't limit their price match to California.

 Arkansas prices, y'all.

 What do you say we get back in our cubbies - and keep this fashion show going.

 - Okay.

 I don't know why I'm just putting this together, but you two are very cheap.

 - You're about to feel - You dunno what you're talking about.

 - my cheap purse on your temple.

 - You do not know.

 Easy now.

 What do you think, Nick?

 Should she take it?

 Take what?

 I don't know what you're talking about.

 Reagan's big promotion.

 Her promotion?

 - Should she take it?

 - I never I didn't hear about it until right now.

 It's just VP of North American sales.

 - VP?

 - It's not a big deal.

 It's just like a heartbeat away from president of North American sales, so - Seems like a pretty big deal.

 - Reagan, it's huge.

 You get to travel all the time.

 So many hotel points.

 Mo' points, mo' problems, that's what I always say.

 It's exciting finding out this way.

 Most people would probably tell their boyfriend when they first found out about it, but that's cool.

 We don't talk, that's why we work, and that's cool and, uh, I'm really bothered by this.

 - Nick.

 - (gasps)

 (ringtone plays)

 Hey, Jess, it's me again.

 Sorry to call you again.

 I just I just really wish you would call me back.

 I'm having a problem, and I feel like you really like when I'm, you know, I'm having a problem.

 Not that you, not that you like it, but, but that-that you like, you like talking about it.

 Anyway, I'm just coming apart here.

 I'm-I'm really a hundred percent falling apart, and I really wish you would call me back.

 - (phone beeps)

 - All right.

 Hey, Schmidty, what's up?

 Just checking in.

 - Okay.

 - (phone beeps)

 Oh, hold on, I got another call.

 All of a sudden my phone's bl*wing up.

 Hi.

 This is Nick Miller.

 Who am I speaking to and why are you calling?

 - Do you not have my number saved?

 - Who is this?

 - Who is this?

 - Who am I speaking to?

 It's it's Cece.

 Cece, why are you both calling me?

 How do you not have my number saved?

 I work for you.

 Cece, I already got Nick.

 Let me patch you in.

 How am I supposed to learn to do a patch if you never let me try?

 Nick, as the only person who takes our advice, - how you doing?

 - Well, you were right.

 Reagan and I never talk.

 We helped you.

 Cece, we helped him.

 - I know, I heard.

 - No.

 You messed everything up.

 You stupid idiots made me realize that I need more than that.

 Now I got to go back to this party with her friends and pretend like it doesn't bother me.

 - Those look fantastic.

 - CECE: Oh, honey, that sounds so rough.

 I said ho one second, my man.

 In the middle of a conversation.

 (Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" plays)

 Dad, I know you got out of bed.

 No, I-I didn't, I didn't.

 I-I-I've been, I've been sleeping.

 I found these little crummies in the kitchen.

 You only gave me a salad and tea.

 I-I-I-I wanted some fish sticks.

 Fish sticks are mostly pork and you know it.

 Now, I'm gonna trim your nails.

 Oh, no.

 Wait, wait, wait.

 Uh, uh, uh, - it's-it's a little too short.

 - (clippers snap)

 It's too ow, ow!

 (screaming)

 I have a good thing going with your mom right now, and I don't want to ruin that.

 - We should just tell her the truth.

 - CECE: Hey-o!

 Problem alert.

 Well, if you need help, you've come to the right place.

 Share, share.

 Please.

 Tell us what seems to be the problem.

 Here's what you're doing, and it's not okay.

 You're inserting yourself into a family matter.

 We can handle this on our own.

 - We're here if you need us.

 - Yeah, watch your front, - 'cause we've got your back.

 - We got your back.

 I just want you to know that I respect that.

 I'm perceiving that.

 Um I'm digesting that.

 It's in the machine.

 It's working its way down.

 And okay.

 I think you're right.

 I think it'll be really good for you to be honest with your mom.

 No.

 See, um, you're gonna come clean.

 I'm gonna stay dirty.

 - Why?

 - CHARMAINE: Aly, I found a roly-poly in these pants, they gave me 89% off.

 - Oh.

 - (laughs)

 That's sweet.

 Um Charmaine, I have to tell you something.

 I don't work in radio.

 I don't.

 I'm actually a cop.

 What?

 Man, you wearing a wire?

 Okay.

 (whispering): Sorry.

 Well, I appreciate you telling me the truth.

 The job is dangerous.

 But I do salute your courage.

 (exhales)

 Okay.

 Um you can salute me, too.

 'Cause, uh, - I'm also a cop.

 - What?!



 Uh, uh, uh, I'm-I'm not a super successful morning radio shock jock.

 - There's no radio show?

 - No.

 I'm a - I'm an officer of the law.

 - What?!

 That's not how you reacted when Aly said she was a cop.

 Being a parent is like wearing your heart outside your body, and now you're telling me that my heart is on these streets by himself?

 Sampling drugs with a Kn*fe to see if it's really cocaine?

 My heart knows what cocaine tastes like?

 - Oh, man.

 - (door slams)

 - That's on you, man.

 - Please shut up.

 REAGAN: It isn't a dream job.

 Sure, it comes with a great salary and a vaccination for the coming elk flu, the flu that you're gonna be hearing about for the next decade.

 But it also requires too much travel, and I'm gonna turn it down.

 - Are you happy now?

 - No.

 I'm not happy.

 'Cause this is the kind of talk I wish we had before.

 These are the important talks.

 This is so unlike you.

 Why are you being the girl in this argument?

 I don't know, Reagan.

 I don't know.

 But I do know you're being heteronormative.

 Okay?

 I know that word it's in the Zeitgeist, and I know that word, too.

 I don't know why I'm acting this way.

 ANNOUNCER: If you're out there, Nick Miller, you're our raffle winner!

 Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

 I did spend $190 on tickets.

 $200.

 I spent $250 on tickets.

 That's it.

 I spent over $300 on tickets.

 "Deciding which house to go to for Thanksgiving, "she was stuck in a real parent trap.

 " - Enough.

 Enough.

 Enough.

 - Oh, you're right.

 - This chapter's dragging.

 - Jess, please.

 - Let me move on.

 - I-I need my freedom.

 I need my judge shows, my fish sticks.

 My-my naked time.

 - Oh, please don't expand on that.

 - No, it's a good thing.

 Ashley showed me how to embrace my body.

 And I every day, for about a half an hour, I walk around here naked.

 - Fabulous.

 - Did you sit on this chair?

 Jess now I'm gonna show you some tough love.

 I want you to go back to California.

 (sighs)

 Wh-what's going on?

 It's Nick.

 I - What?

 - I'm-I'm in love with him, and I can't I can't do anything about it.

 I'm sorry.

 He's really happy with someone else.

 - I couldn't go back there.

 - Hey, hey, hey.

 It's okay.

 You don't have to.

 You can stay here as long as you want.

 You've been taking care of me, now I'm gonna take care of you.

 You know what, I'm gonna read you one of my favorite books.

 See?

 - Oh - Before the Web: The Story of Telephone Operators.

 "She sat by the switchboard, "anxiously awaiting "the phone call.

 "Ring.

 Ring.

 "Ring.

 " I don't even understand what we're arguing about.

 I'm mad about the promotion.

 And that you have been sitting on it for a month and not telling me.

 I thought that you liked that we have our own thing.

 - I don't know, maybe I - That we were two independent, different people and we live our lives and then we come together and we hang out.

 I just want more, I guess.

 I want to talk about stuff, and I know while I'm saying this I hate that I'm saying it, but I feel it.

 Nick, we're talking about stuff right now.

 No, we're not talking about all the stuff.

 - We're talking about some of the stuff.

 - How much stuff is there?

 There's piles of stuff.

 There's piles upon piles of stuff.

 Like, I want to talk about I want to talk about why we don't have nicknames for each other?

 I mean, why don't we call each other Mr.

 Cub and Sparky?

 Who's Mr.

 Cub?

 You're Mr. Cub?

 You think I would be Sparky?

 If we had nicknames it would not be those.

 You just call me Nick, is my point.

 - That's your name.

 - I know, but I would like to talk about nicknames.

 It doesn't matter.

 All this matters.

 This is the stuff.

 I want to talk about why you have a second apartment.

 - We talked about that.

 - And it was weird then.

 We barely talked about it.

 I also want to talk about the fact I've never been at my best sexually with you.

 I've been, like, a seven, but, at other times in my life, I've been an eight-and-a-half.

 - Okay.

 - But you've only seen a seven.

 So you think of me as a seven in bed.

 - But I'm an eight-and-a-half.

 - I'm really tired.

 Can you just write it all down and I'll fill it out and I'll get it back to you.

 All right, then just answer me this, and then we'll be done.

 'Cause this is important.

 If we weren't together and you were offered this same promotion, would you take it?

 Yes, I would take it.

 Then you should take the job, Reagan.

 Okay, I'll take it.

 Are we cool?

 Yeah.

 Dream job.

 Good, I'm so happy for you.

 This is awesome.

 Uh, okay.

 (clears throat)

 But before we go to bed tonight, can you please just do something about your raffle prize?

 - His name's Stewart.

 - Why did you bring it home?

 I don't know, I won.

 (grunts)

 Hey, thought I might find you here.

 Oh.

 - Hiding your maybes?

 - (chuckles)

 Sometimes I hide mine in a garbage can.

 A new one.

 Don't try to talk me out of worrying about my son.

 I won't.

 I just want you to know you're not alone.

 I'm out there worrying about him, too, but we have got each other's backs.

 How's that dress gonna fit you when you ain't got no legs?

 Oh.

 I need to tell you something.

 No, no, just let me go first.

 This job has given me so much.

 Purpose, pride, my future wife, CPR certification against my will, I might add, because I truly believe that it is witchcraft, but that's not the point.

 I have tried so many things.

 But being a cop is the first time I've ever felt a calling.

 I'm proud of you.

 Yeah.

 I-I will deal with my fears.

 Um but there's one more thing.

 Oh, my God.

 Mom, you've been a cop this whole time?

 No.

 - You're not a cop.

 - It was your dad's.

 He's a cop.

 Wherever the hell he is.

 Wow.

 Um You know, that's the first thing you ever told me about him.

 So you know I got a lot of practice worrying about someone coming home.

 Maybe that's the reason I'm so overprotective with you.

 He left this behind, among other things.

 I just use it to get out of tickets.

 And one time I did use it for a discount on a - a rental car.

 - Oh.

 - Take it.

 - No, I don't want it.

 You're my dad.

 You're my mom and my dad.

 I know that.

 And I'm not saying he's not a piece of crap, either.

 But you should have this.

 We can talk about this later, but what was the rental car company you used?

 (sighs)

 Well, I don't think me and Reagan are working out.

 Really?

 Oh, bub, I'm so sorry.

 Come lay your head on my bosom.

 Come here.

 No, I'll do hers if I was gonna do either, but well, I'm really glad you guys are here.

 Tell us everything.

 - But first, say that one more time.

 - Oh, you really want me to?

 - Yeah.

 - Yeah.

 Oh.

 Uh, I'm really glad you're here.

 We're really glad that we're here, too.

 Very happy about it.

 - All right.

 - One more time.

 The part about you being glad that we're here.

 - Making me regret it.

 - One more time.

 I feel like we talked about everything.

 I'm gonna grab a beer.

 (Australian accent): I like American football a lot.

 And you know who I like, I like that Tom Brady.

 Uh, I like the way he looks, I like the way he smells.

 Nick, shut up, man!

 I'm at I'm at work.

 Mi-mi-mi, mi-mi-mi.

 Chacho.

 (deep voice): Chacho.

 This is traffic on the 12.

 Linda?

 Move!

 Get your ass out the way!

 I'm trying to get to work on time.

 Linda, you okay?

 I'm fine.

 It's the reason why I'm late.

 I'm in traffic behind a damn Camry.

 If he don't move his ass out the way Linda, all right, that's enough of you.

 (laughs)

 PG-13.





So I really want to ask what's in the box, but, uh, it'll ignite a whole Seven thing.

 "What's in the box?

 What's in the box?" 

 "Repeat, John Doe has the upper hand.

 " I have got to see this movie.

 You guys make it sound so hilarious.

 Anyway, my former boss, Principal Foster, survived a real dicey safari in Africa.

 His takeaway was that material possessions mean nothing.

 Including his collection of super fancy, old-ass wine.

 The lions came at night.

 That put everything in perspective.

 Everything, dawg.

 Ooh.

 Jess, thank you.

 This is perfect.

 Cece and I are completely moved into Jaipur Aviv.

 So tonight, we'll be doing it for the first time on our first night in our first house.

 And I'm going to Aly's tonight.

 Yeah.

 Gonna be doing it for the 10,000th time on our 1,000th night in her 100th apartment?

 You think Aly's lived in 100 apartments?

 I hadn't, I hadn't crunched the numbers on it.

 So, Reagan's out of town till tomorrow.

 What are you and Nick gonna do tonight?

 What makes you assume I'm hanging out with Nick?

 I'm sorry.

 What are you doing tonight?

 (mumbles): Picking out clothes for Nick.

 What?

 I can't hear you.

 I'm helping Nick pick out an outfit.

 I we have to nail down his look for SOCALYALCON 6.

 Wow, SOCALYALCON 6.

 Wow.

 I can't believe it's been a whole year since the last Southern California Young Adult Literature Conference.

 NICK: You're a 12-year-old girl.

 You spent $35 to meet me.

 Is this what you want me to look like?

 I got two questions: uh, where'd I get $35 from, and also, can my name be Daphne?

 And I read that authors should all have a strong look, so I found four authors with strong looks, and I combined them.

 Tom Wolfe: white suit.

 Hunter S.

 Thompson: yellow sunglasses.

 David Foster Wallace: bandana.

 Toni Morrison: The Presidential Medal of Freedom.

 Here you go.

 Well, that's perfect, Jess.

 Well, it was easy.

 You have very few clothing items in your closet.

 Also, are those your tax returns?

 And why are you drying beef?

 Because I don't have a file cabinet, and because I couldn't eat all the meat in one night.

 - Now - That's gross.

 - how do I look?

 - What you need is a navy blazer.

 Do you have a navy blazer or just the pit boss special?

 What kind of a man owns multiple blazers?

 (snickering)

 SCHMIDT: Ha!

 There's so many places for sex!

 (moans)

 (panting): All right.

 That makes it official.

 Houses are way better than apartments.

 Now that we're out of closets, watch out laundry room.

 - (chuckles)

 - (exhales)

 - Know what that sound is?

 - Hmm?

 That is the absence of Nick.

 The lack of Winston.

 (knocking on door)

 - What was that?

 - Someone's hitting our house.

 It sounded like, like, a, like, knocking.

 Yeah, but the-the door is that way.

 Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

 We have a back door.

 BOTH: Houses have a back door.

 (laughs)

 What kind of person comes to a back door?

 - Jeremy.

 - On behalf of the neighborhood, may I be the first to say, welcome, sir.

 "A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy.

 " - I didn't know you lived nearby.

 - I don't.

 But I will someday.

 Just as I will do everything that you have done.

 (grunts)

 That's the tone that we talked about, Jeremy.

 No, thank you.

 I can't wait to have a servants' entrance.

 - Let's not call it that.

 - Two points of entry.

 Very well done, sir.

 Cece, I just thought of another reason why houses are better than apartments.

 - Now we can enjoy two points of entry!

 - CECE: No, thanks!

 I'm talking about the doors.

 I-I didn't mean ALY: So a lion scares Jess's old boss in Nigeria, and we get so drunk we have sex on a dresser in America.

 What a world.

 - It's all connected, baby.

 - (chuckles)

 And the broken dresser, that's my fault.

 I'm all haunch.

 - I'll buy you a new one.

 - You don't have to.

 Because guess who has two dressers.

 - Rip Torn.

 - No.

 Me.

 I mean, you and Rip Torn.

 Stop talking about Rip Torn.

 - You have a backup dresser?

 - Yeah.

 Just when I thought you couldn't get any more perfect.

 It's in my ugh, my storage unit.

 I-I'll get it tomorrow.

 A dresser's pretty big; I could help you.

 That's okay.

 I'll just get it tomorrow.

 - I mean, my day is wide open 

 - I said no!

 (quietly): Okay.

 "A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy" is very comprehensive.

 Yes, the fact that we're in between a raisin house and a toothbrush house, makes me feel very confident about Halloween.

 Crime statistics?

 We have crime?

 Crime that warrants statistics?

 Oh, my God.

 It says there were 14 home invasions last year.

 Up six percent from 2015?

 Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

 W-we're just gonna get worked up about nothing.

 Right?

 There are only two ways into this place, the front door and the back door and we've locked them both.

 - We're good, we're good.

 - We're good.

 - Yeah, we're good.

 - Yeah, no.

 It's fine.

 - Yeah.

 We're fine.

 - I just - Yeah.

 Okay.

 - Okay.

 At the risk of sounding clichÃ©, should we have sex in the bedroom?

 I think that's a great idea.

 - (chuckles)

 - (clattering)

 - (gasps, shrieks)

 - The hell was that?!

 Are you the criminals?!

 From the statistics?!

 (Nick groaning)

 - (shouts)

 - Oh, what are you doing?

 I almost h*t you with this brushed steel modern lamp.

 - Really?

 - I am sorry we broke in, but I'm also pretty impressed with us.

 What kind of taco meat you bitches have?

 (Nick and Jess laugh)

 SCHMIDT: I told you, if we locked both the doors, our guests would know to come in through the windows.

 Our ground floor windows.

 You see?

 What started out as snark has become a real eye-opener.

 What did you want us to do?

 Ring the bell and wake you guys up?

 Oh, no.

 Thank God you didn't wake us up.

 See?

 I told you they'd be cool.

 Ask him.

 You were right.

 Schmidt, here's my question.

 Apologies.

 My author look is missing one thing Navy blue, medium weight, two button.

 I know the blazer.

 Nick, listen to me.

 If you ever, ever need a blazer, I don't care how late it is, till the day I die, you wake me up.

 Thanks.

 Okay.

 We're gonna have a conversation.

 - I am a little concerned.

 - I know.

 What if the blazer doesn't fit?

 No.

 About you and Nick.

 And about how you're being his girlfriend.

 - You mean being his good friend.

 - I mean being his girlfriend.

 A good friend will maybe drive someone to the mall in the daytime so that they can buy a blazer.

 They don't go on a giggly late night crime date so that they can steal one.

 That's girlfriend stuff.

 You've been doing a lot of girlfriend stuff lately.

 "Godfather of Soul, blank Brown. " Five letters.

 - Bubba.

 - Okay.

 Wait, you want to know who wins in a fight between Winston Bishop and Winston Churchill?

 Hey, do you know what this book's about?

 Bayou n-noir.

 Uh, Pepperwood, he's a private investigator It's about a man who has nothing, who risks everything, to feel something.

 Thank you.

 None of that's girlfriend stuff.

 That's all good friend stuff.

 Okay, let me, uh, toss out a hypothetical to you, okay?

 Nick has a piece of lint on his sleeve.

 Do you go, "Hey, bud, you got some lint on your sleeve"?

 Or do you pick it off?

 - I don't see how that's relevant.

 - Yes, you do.

 Because you are a rabid watcher of The Crown.

 - I watch a lot of shows.

 - And so therefore, you know that picking lint off of a man's sleeve is the most intimate gesture.

 I just leave it there.

 A little piece of lint on his sleeve.

 - I wouldn't do anything.

 - What would you just want to Fine!

 I'd want to pick it off with my bare hands!

 Oh, my God.

 I'm the girlfriend.

 I'm so nervous for SOCALYALCON 6 that I lost my appetite.

 But then I found my appetite, but now, now that I found my appetite, nothing sounds good.

 Mm, sounds like you're in a complicated way, my man.

 You know what actually does sound good?

 The cake you made on the Fourth of July.

 - Would you make it again?

 - You want me to make a, uh, an American flag sheet cake in March?

 Yes.

 It'll be fun.

 We'll do it together.

 - You get to wear this.

 - Okay.

 My favorite apron.

 You know what, no!

 No, I'm not doing this anymore.

 Anymore?

 We've never made a cake together.

 Wait, have we?

 If we have, I don't remember.

 I drink.

 No, not no.

 Not just this.

 All of it.

 All the girlfriend stuff.

 It's not fair.

 All right.

 Sorry.

 I-I didn't know you felt that way.

 No.

 (scoffs)

 I don't feel that way, I - But you said unfair.

 - Yeah, I did.

 I said that 'cause I if I feel it is unfair.

 To Reagan.

 She's your girlfriend, I'm your good friend.

 She, you know, she should she should get to make you sheet cake.

 Yeah, that makes sense.

 I just need to make something clear between us.

 If that's okay.

 You're saying "sheet" like "ghost clothes," not like "in a toilet," right?

 Whoa.

 I taught English in Japan for a couple years after college and I fell in with a bad crowd.

 It was a time in my life I'm not proud of.

 I fell in with with a Japanese game show crowd.

 (speaking Japanese)

 Which one?

 - (speaking Japanese)

 - This one?

 This one or this one?

 - I don't understand you!

 - (crowd chanting in Japanese)

 Okay.

 (bell dinging, crowd cheering)

 (announcer speaking Japanese)

 (shouting in Japanese)

 Oh, my God, I did it!

 I did it!

 I did it!

 (yells)

 I did it!

 I was a ten-time top master champion on Protocol of Best Enjoyment.

 - These are the spoils.

 - Question is that hippo rideable?

 (whoops, laughs)

 (whoops)

 Those day laborers were right.

 This stuff is awesome.

 Why was I so embarrassed for you to see it?

 If this is your deep, dark, embarrassing secret, then I am worried for you to see what's buried in my storage unit.

 I feel like I'm pretty up-to-date on your embarrassing secrets.

 Oh, honey.

 I have chapters in my life you know nothing about.

 - Wait, really?

 - Here we go.

 I once sold knives door-to-door in high school.

 And Byron Allen knocked me out.

 Yeah, that was, like, the first thing you told me when we met.

 Oh, yeah.

 (laughs)

 I do use that as an icebreaker, I forgot.

 Well, here's one from deep in the storage unit.

 Way in the back.

 I once got my foot stuck in a go-kart.

 - And I had to - Hop six laps alongside of it.

 I've been kicked out of multiple focus groups for for crying too much.

 That happened yesterday, and I was with you.

 I fell asleep in study hall.

 Had a very loud sex dream.

 That happened to my family member, and I relayed the story to you.

 - I fell asleep in a bathtub.

 - Knew that.

 And I once dislocated my thumb getting off a couch.

 Okay, you got five more minutes on that hippo, and then we switch.

 JESS: (groans)

 What was wrong with me?

 Well (chuckles)

 nothing in this picture.

 Hello, gorgeous.

 Crop and keep.

 (music playing nearby)

 Reagan!

 Hi.

 How do you get off a plane and still look dewy as hell?

 Uh, I made a deal with the devil some time ago.

 (laughs)

 - Hey, I'm the blue words.

 - Too late.

 We're going with it.

 I picked you out Well, welcome back!

 Sorry.

 (chuckles)

 I don't know why I'm still shouting.

 Um, so Nick told me about what's been going on with you two.

 Oh, he did?

 - Listen, Reagan 

 - No, you listen to me.

 The next time I find out that my man has been coming to you for cake I'm gonna take you out to dinner 

 - to say thank you.

 - (chuckles)

 Because I hate baking.

 (both chuckle)

 Speaking of dinner, why wait?

 Why don't we do that tonight?

 About Nick, um Jess, you don't have to change your relationship with Nick because of me.

 I'm not a jealous person.

 But thank you for thinking of me.

 That's very nice.

 You're a really good friend.

 And that is why I got you this gift.

 Oh, expensive jewelry.

 (chuckles nervously)

 Classic friend gift.

 Thank you, friend.

 But I don't have anything for you.

 Except this nice wink.

 And here it comes.

 And bam.

 (chuckles)

 Oh, you're really tense.

 Yeah, you don't have to do that.

 My-my tension's what drives me.

 - Oh, no, I want to.

 - Mm-hmm.

 I don't have a lot of friends that are girls.

 - Mm.

 - Oh, my God, I think you're my first girlfriend.

 I'm sure you're missing someone, like, from high school or college.

 Somebody?

 A cousin?

 WINSTON: That much is true SCHMIDT: All 22 points of entry locked.

 - Good night, babe.

 - Good night.

 - Mm.

 - Exhausted.

 I know.

 I feel so safe.

 - So, here's the thing.

 - (screams)

 - Devil woman!

 - How are you doing that?

 I just had a four-hour dinner with Reagan.

 At which, we shared something called "The Lovers' Pork.

 " Cece, it's getting worse.

 I'm both their girlfriends.

 How did you get in here, Jess?

 - Through the doggy door.

 - There's a doggy door?

 Well, it's flush with the people door, and it's painted shut, so I really had to put my head into it.

 God, I don't want to be both their girlfriends.

 Why do they both need me so much all of a sudden?

 BOTH: All of a sudden?!

 This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.

 Even if nothing comes of it.

 She came here to see you.

 I bet you're reading into it.

 What if I go talk to her?

 So I fly you down, - you are my gift to Nick.

 - I'm in.

 Have you talked to Reagan about this?

 I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.

 Just tell him you believe in him and that he can do it.

 Just go talk to Reagan.

 So, work it out.

 You know who you should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.

 - No.

 No.

 - Nick!

 (gasps)

 Oh, my God.

 It's not all of a sudden.

 - They've needed me all along.

 - SCHMIDT and CECE: Yeah.

 - Am I the only reason they're together?

 - SCHMIDT and CECE: Yeah.

 Am I the architect of my own nightmare?

 Okay, no, no, no, no, honey.

 It's not like you introduced them or something.

 Well, they did just get together because she left for jury duty.

 I've pushed those two together like a god on Mount Olympus, too cheap to pay for p*rn.

 No, no, no, it's like their relationship is a flood that's about to happen and you're the little Dutch boy with your thumb in the dike.

 JESS: Well, no more.

 I'm taking my thumb out of them.

 (groans)

 Is there anything other than Dutch boys or god p*rn?

 I know, pandas.

 I'm a zookeeper.

 - They are my panda.

 - What?

 - What?

 - Pandas wouldn't be alive without humans.

 They can't run, they can't growl, they can't even mate without us.

 Have you been helping Nick and Reagan mate?

 In a way, yes.

 But I'm done.

 This zookeeper is through handing out bamboo.

 Reagan and Nick deserve a chance to see if they can survive on their own.

 Yes, and the zookeeper deserves a chance to be on a late night show with hilarious animals that poop on the host's - I don't what am I saying anymore?

 - I don't know.

 I don't even know.

 Look, honey, you you deserve the right to do what's best for you.

 Well (sighs)

 that, too.

 I saw a lizard once, uh, making diarrhea on Johnny Carson.

 (Winston and Aly laughing)



 TRAMPOLINE: You are number one supreme jumper!

 Okay, I have, like, a million questions about what's going on here, but TRAMPOLINE: You are bouncer of much success!

 - Yeah, we are!

 - (grunts)

 Could you guys stick around for a little bit?

 - 'Cause I don't - TRAMPOLINE: You soar higher - than osprey and crane!

 - Yes!

 I don't want to be alone with Nick and Reagan.

 TRAMPOLINE: You are gravity's master!

 He weeps at your feet.

 Okay, sure, Jess.

 We don't have to be at the station till till, uh ALY: This just says we're ten days from a full moon.

 Yeah, it's weird, I can't get mine out of scuba mode.

 - I don't know how to read this.

 - It's 11:45.

 - What?!

 - What?

 Oh, no, no, no, no.

 Come on.

 TRAMPOLINE: Farewell, emperors of trampoline.

 Look, sorry, Jess, but we got to be at the station in less than 15 minutes.

 Oh!

 I just figured out something that you definitely do not know.

 I blew my nose once and a bug came out.

 We were all there when that happened.

 That was at my birthday brunch.

 Hey, Jess!

 Oh, hey, guys.

 I can't talk; I have so much paper to fold.

 REAGAN: Well, you better get it all folded tonight, because guess where you are being whisked away to tomorrow.

 (chuckles)

 Palm Springs, California, where the only thing hotter than the weather are the gay senior citizens and SOCALYALCON 6.

 Jess, we've been talking about how much we appreciate your friendship and how close we both feel to you, right?

 - Yeah, that's right.

 - Well, I, too, have, um, - felt that closeness, and, um - That's why we got you this.

 Oh, no.

 - That is for you now.

 - No.

 This and a necklace?

 (chuckles)

 Neck, neck, neck, neck, na-neck, neck, neck Neck's all loaded up.

 Uh, but seriously, I can't accept this.

 It's-it's too, um, expensive.

 Money is no object.

 That's why we rented a custom van, - and even got space radio.

 - Satellite radio.

 No, space radio, the one that connects to everything in the air.

 - There's a satellite.

 - What, the satellite's in the ground?

 No, the satellite is in the air.

 - Right.

 Space.

 Yeah.

 - In the air.

 Satellite radio.

 And don't you worry about accommodations, because we also took care of that.

 You got your very own hotel room.

 It's adjacent to ours, but it's very private.

 I mean, it is called a peekaboo suite, so there might be a little bit of crossover.

 NICK: It's everything you like: it-it's kids, it's reading.

 You are gonna get so many free bookmarks.

 Do I get a per diem?

 Yeah.

 What's that?

 - All right, doggy door.

 - Sealed.

 - Attic.

 - Padlocked.

 - Crawlspace.

 - Uncrawlable.

 The cast of Sneakers couldn't get into this place.

 Uh Well, I guess I'm going to Palm Springs.

 I just need your big-ass hat.

 The front door.

 Bye.

 25 points of entry is too many points of entry!

 - (door closes)

 - How?

 How?!

 Wait, wait, don't tell me.

 Agent Isosceles, part geometry prodigy, part CIA spy, all scared of girls.

 - Wrong.

 Cadet Isosceles.

 - Oh.

 It's all right.

 You know, it's just, technically, this is just for myself (voice fading)

 Wait.

 Do you remember when you had to smuggle the golden sextant out of the Paris Math Academy?

 - I do.

 - I have a mission for you that is even more sensitive.

 (grunting)

 - Son of a - All right, this is the last of it.

 Whew!

 Are you sure we have to do this?

 Babe, we're police officers who almost missed a shift because we were busy bouncing.

 You're right.

 Our capacity for joy is just way too high.

 Okay, so I have one last secret.

 So cute that you keep calling them secrets.

 Just hear me out.

 Um, I've lied to every girl I said "I love you" to.

 I mean, I thought I loved them, but then I met you and realized I've never been in love before.

 I did not know that.

 Yeah, it was eating me up inside, so I called them each individually and said, "I never loved you.

 " Okay.

 Seems unnecessary.

 One of them took it very badly.

 Oh, one of them took it badly?

 I mean, she's okay now.

 Well, sort kinda.

 She lives at the top of a very tall tree.

 Maybe, like, run stuff like that by me.

 Okay, let me just sign this right here.

 Here you go.

 My associate asked me to give this to one of you.

 She had to go.

 The rest is in the note.

 Uh, it says, "I had to go.

 Jess.

 " Did she say any What's this book about?

 Uh, it's I mean, it's it's hard to exp Reagan?

 - Uh - Reagan, what is it Just tell her what it's about.

 He wrote this book.

 It's about a man with nothing, risking everything to feel something.

 I'll take it.

 Can you sign it?

 "k*ll yourself.

 " (chuckles)

 It's a joke.

 It's a reference to You'll get it.

 (chuckles)

 Hey, so how's SOCALYCAL SOCALYALCON 6?

 JESS: I don't know.

 I'm at the airport.

 - What?

 Where are you going?

 - I don't know.

 - How long you gonna be gone for?

 - I don't know.

 - What's two plus two?

 - Four.

 I'm listening to your questions, I just don't know the answer to them.

 I mean, this isn't like you; you always say if you had to choose between planning a trip or taking a trip, you'd choose planning.

 And I stand by that.

 I just, I really need a change of scenery.

 I'm probably just gonna hang with my dad in Portland.

 I did what you said.

 I did what was right for me today.

 I just don't know what's right for me tomorrow.

 I do know that the prices of the tickets are not going down while we yap.

 So I got to go.

 I love you.

 Bye.

 - (ringtone playing)

 - Oh, Cece, I'm fine I don't know why you disappeared, Jess, but you know what, I'm sure you'll fill me in back at the hotel.

 Also, when I sign a book "k*ll yourself," you think they know that's a reference to Pepperwood's dilemma at the fish market, right?

 Actually, you know what, that's a question for Reagan.

 Okay, sorry.

 See you later, Jess.

 Cece, come check this out.

 (locks clicking)

 What?

 Did that, did that just lock everything?

 One touch secures every point of entry in the entire house, bringing us convenience and real-time peace of mind.

 Okay, can I unlock it?

 Well, unlocking it requires a pass code.

 Ours is "my beautiful Cece," all one word.

 - Very sweet.

 - (phone chimes)

 Oh, sh**t.

 Actually, I screwed up.

 Um, it's "my beautiful, beautiful Cece.

 " - Two "beautifuls.

 " - Okay.

 (phone chimes)

 (clears throat)

 Oh, you know what, I know what it is.

 Great, just put it in.

 I'm freezing.

 I can't.

 It only gives you three tries, then it locks you out of the app for 12 hours.

 - For 12 hours?!

 - It's fine.

 We'll go analog.

 Give me your key.

 Uh, I'd love to, but it's on the counter, next to yours.

 It's gonna be fine.

 Don't worry about a thing.

 I promise you, we'll figure this out.

 - Override.

 - (phone chimes)

 - My beautiful, beautiful Cece.

 - (phone chimes)

 - Override.

 Override.

 - Oh, God.

 (coughing)

 - Were you in the chimney?

 - (hacks)

 Yes.

 The 26th point of entry.

 - (coughing)

 - Oh, my God.

 Also, we have squirrels.

 Aw, I love squirrels.

 They're not alive.

 I counted at least nine of 'em.

 - Oh, my God.

 Cece - (knocking)

 My beautiful, beautiful Cece





I need it.

 I have a big day at work today.

 I need it more.

 I have to bake muffins before work.

 - What?

 Why?

 - 'Cause it's for my "Lunch With Your Princi-Pal" campaign.

 See, being principal's great, but unlike being vice principal, now the buck stops with me.

 I'm "the Man" now, and all the kids can just smell "the Man" all over me.

 That sounded really weird.

 All I'm saying is, suddenly I have no relationship with the kids.

 I'm really counting on these muffins to humanize me.

 I deserve that coffee.

 I'm finally director of marketing at Ass Strat.

 Today I get to hire an assistant.

 I'm gonna be tough, but I won't be a screamer.

 It's not constructive, it's rude.

 - Ooh, coffee.

 - Your pour that coffee down, you throw it or I'll pour your blood on the ground!

 - You'll pour my blood on the ground?

 - I'll Kn*fe you!

 Look, I got a full day of writing ahead of me, and that requires a fourth cup of joe.

 What else is my whiskey gonna swim in?

 You're taking this too far.

 You treat that heart of yours like a baseball-man's mitt.

 Uh, hello, I am the one packing for our move today, so I will be having, uh, the coffee.

 (all clamoring)

 - I get the coffee!

 - Enough is enough with this!

 - What are you doing here, Winston?!

 - I get the coffee!

 Enough!

 You guys are tearing each other apart.

 For what?

 Coffee?

 Come on, man, you already got that energy inside of you.

 And that is the light of the Lord.

 (chuckles)

 Man, this?

 This ain't nothing but the devil's water.

 - Nah, I'm just playing.

 - Hey, Winston!

 - (all clamoring)

 - Winston, that wasn't fair!

 I'll Kn*fe you by the urinal, Winston!

 Enough with the knifing.

 Today's the day it all turns around.

 - Hey.

 - Sorr I'm sorry I h*t you, Jess.

 I didn't mean to.

 I'm using magnetic words to break through my writer's block, and it's not working.

 I've already folded all my shirts and masturbated six times, and I'm running out of things to do.

 I'm just in a real bind.

 You see, The Pepperwood Chronicles sold over 30 copies, Jess.

 So, what, we're complaining about good things now?

 It's just, my audience is gonna be clamoring for a sequel, and I can't leave those stevedores, those-those tugboat workers, those lighthouse keepers empty-handed.

 You think that your audience is entirely made of, like Blue-collar nautical workers on the coastline of Maine.

 I don't think that, Jess, I know that.

 Okay, Nick, you're incredibly talented.

 You can do this.

 And you have the key, - and the key is simply - (phone alarm beeping)

 Oh.

 I have to go.

 Simply what?

 Jess, simply what?!

 - (door closes)

 - (groans)

 All right.

 What do we have here?

 "Sentient feces.

 " Why is there a magnet that says "feces"?

 All right.

 Trust the process.

 Ugh.

 Thanks for helping me pack.

 No problem.

 This might be our last chance for a mess-around.

 Don't you start with that last mess-around stuff.

 - Don't you start.

 - Don't start, 'cause then I'll start.

 Look, I'm already starting.

 Don't start.

 - I didn't start this whole thing.

 - I can't do it, okay?

 (sighs)

 Okay.

 Okay, we agreed, let's just pack, okay?

 Great.

 - Furguson?

 Where have you been?

 - What?

 Hi!

 WINSTON: Huh?

 When you leave the house, you take your cell phone with you.

 Oh!

 Oh, thank you so much for grabbing my cat.

 Come on, Sweatshirt, there's still some sashimi left between my toes.

 Uh, this here is, uh, Winston's cat, Furguson.

 Sweatshirt walked through my door a year ago, and while he may come and go as he pleases, he loves Mommy and her little milkies.

 Yes, he does.

 - I'm his home.

 - Oh, really?

 So why do I have a photo of Furguson on my phone?

 Oh, yeah?

 Then why do I have a picture of Sweatshirt - on my sweatshirt?

 - Oh, damn.

 Furguson, you got you got two families, you dirty dog.

 Look, I'm sorry about that.

 I'm Winston.

 This is Cece.

 Name's Gil like the man's name, but for me.

 Cornell.

 Magna cum laude.

 Two years of executive assistant experience.

 Very nice.

 Is this 24-pound linen stock?

 - Uh, yeah, it is.

 - Impressive.

 Ken, do me a favor.

 Will you, uh, untie your tie?

 Uh, I can't, actually.

 It's, um it's a clip-on.

 I know.

 Thanks so much, son.

 See yourself out.

 Next.

 MAN: Hello, sir.

 - Hello.

 - My name is Jeremy.

 Thank you.

 Let me give you a scenario.

 We land the Bronco Blue Jeans account and install Brett Favre as its face.

 You receive a call from a nosy maÃ®tre d'.

 It appears that Brett has been spotted at the Ritz-Carlton eating a salad, dressed in a tuxedo.

 The paparazzi are on their way.

 You rush in to alert me.

 You find me d*ad.

 What do you do?

 I find a h*nky-tonk bar near the Ritz Carlton.

 I leave a pair of perfectly broken-in Bronco Blue Jeans in Mr.

 Favre's size, as well as a grass-stained T-shirt on the floor of the bathroom.

 I get on the phone, rent a tractor, drive it directly into the swimming pool of the Ritz-Carlton.

 When the staff is distracted, I physically subdue Mr.

 Favre under the weight of my full body, look him in the eyes and tell him to repeat after me: "I got drunk playing football and remember nothing since.

 "I would never knowingly wear a tuxedo, "drive a tractor into a swimming pool or eat a salad.

 "And I would never knowingly "leave my Bronco Blue Jeans behind.

 " - And the maÃ®tre d'?

 - I rented the tractor in his name.

 The next call he'll be making will be from the police station.

 Welcome to Ass Strat.

 Muffin?

 Muffin.

 They're homemade.

 - Blueberry.

 - You're so funny!

 Look out, principal's coming!

 (chuckles)

 Bah.

 Just kidding.

 Muffin?

 Are you calling me Muffin or offering me one?

 Either way, no.

 Okay.

 Well, cool, cool, cool, cool.

 I think Bayou Sue sent the letter Sorry, what did you say?

 Sorry.

 Are we in trouble?

 No, I just Did you say Bayou Sue?

 She's just a character in this book that we're obsessed with.

 Yeah, Pepperwood Chronicles.

 Anyway, you probably wouldn't know anything about it.

 I put a couple copies in the library, and the librarian didn't think it'd go anywhere.

 (chuckles)

 I can't wait to rub it in Esther's smug face.

 - That's very flattering.

 - Please come and talk to these girls.

 They're obsessed with Pepperwood.

 I don't have time for this.

 I'm only on page two.

 And page one is just a dedication to Winston.

 Ugh.

 Come on.

 The kids used to love Vice Principal Jess, and now they won't have anything to do with Principal Jess.

 It's like I'm living in my own damn adorable shadow.

 Please?

 You-you might get some ideas from your audience.

 My audience is the men who built this great country.

 Your students would never understand that Pepperwood's just a New Orleans story about a guy fighting with the alligator within.

 Well, could you just do it for me?

 Yeah, I'll.

 .

 I mean, I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.

 Well, then why didn't you You know what, I'm happy with where we ended up, but you took me on a real spin around the block there.

 So, as you can see here, I treat Furguson right.

 - Mm-hmm.

 - WINSTON: Okay?

 - Organic kitty litter.

 - Mm-hmm.

 I got the miniature piano, the tiny, tiny treadmill, and right over here is where we do couples yoga.

 (gags)

 Fish nuggets?

 Oh, well, that would explain his recent oily eliminations, which I document on the cloud.

 You track his poop?

 What, you just weigh his hairballs and clock out?

 - I mean, I - Furguson is happy here, okay?

 (voice breaks): Around people that actually cherish him.

 - Don't you start, Cece.

 - And who helped him become the cat that he is.

 - Now ain't the time.

 - I'm sorry, but it's true.

 Now ain't the time.

 - What's happening?

 - CECE: I'm trying, okay?

 I've just got to breathe for a second.

 Let me explain something to you, okay?

 Furguson is my cat.

 I found him first.

 Well, you may have found Furguson, but Sweatshirt found me.

 I see you want to play hardball here.

 - How about this?

 - Mm-hmm.

 We settle things the way we do on the street.

 - Mm-hmm.

 - Catcall.

 - What?

 - We let Furguson decide.

 - Oh, yeah.

 - Fine.

 We'll leave the decision in his paws.

 Which are now incredibly strong, thanks to his new set of, uh, mini-dumbbells.

 - You're welcome.

 - (chuckling)

 Ooh, ooh!

 Okay, Pepper-heads!

 Get ready for a memorable experience, which I hope you will recount at your weddings, which I will also be at, brought to you by your favorite principal-slash-friend, Jessica Day.

 Please welcome your favorite author, Nick Miller!

 - (girls cheering)

 - Yay!

 No, no, no.

 Stop it, stop it.

 All right, let's get this over with.

 Uh, let's talk about the book you guys most certainly don't understand because it wasn't written for you or people your age.

 Go ahead.

 - The kissing.

 - OMG, the romance.

 - The make out scene at the levee.

 - Oh, the romance.

 Guys!

 Pepperwood's about way more than just a romance.

 It's it's, uh, it's about life, you know?

 Race.

 The sexualization of the American g*n.

 - (whispers): Keep it clean.

 - Okay.

 It's a story about his ambiguous relationship with with justice.

 But the romance is amazing.

 It made me realize it doesn't matter if I'm straight or gay; I'm just me.

 You got that from my book?

 That's yeah.

 That was positive.

 Do you think that's because of the gay dog character?

 - Yeah.

 - What I really respect about that is it's never mentioned that he's a gay dog.

 But you got that from the writing.

 And that's pretty dope.

 You write female desire so well.

 - Thank you.

 - That's okay to say, right?

 Yah, Ramona.

 I'm-I'm just like you.

 I'm your princi-pal.

 I'm your friend.

 I like to just throw on my rollerblades, and just go out there and think.

 NICK: Can I ask you guys about the scene - in the fish morgue?

 - Oh, my God, - that was my favorite chapter.

 - Mine, too.

 - I read it, like, five times.

 - Yeah, same!

 (mouthing)

 - What?

 - I stayed up all night.

 It was such a good chapter.

 - Thank you.

 - Oh, yeah.

 You're welcome.

 Why'd you whisper it?

 Jeremy, I'm just gonna go grab a coffee, - and then I will - Dark roast, soy creamer, 160 degrees.

 - How was your lunch, sir?

 - Disappointing.

 Why don't you eat the homemade bucatini I brought for myself?

 Well, thank you, Jeremy.

 Um, you know, - I'm not getting e-mails on my - (phone beeps)

 I just got an e-mail on my phone.

 It's from you.

 "Subject: Your e-mail is now working.

 " All right.

 Well, Jeremy, I'm just gonna go enjoy this bucatini and, uh, organize the Peterson account.

 - I did it already.

 - You did?

 - Okay.

 I guess I'll just - Enjoy your lunch.

 Yeah.

 So you're saying that Lady Diamante doesn't realize that it's Pepperwood's underwear for years later, like, 20 years later?

 Maybe she never realizes.

 Yes.

 That's what I was gonna say, too.

 We you and me, we're right here.

 - All right.

 - (school bell rings)

 Wow.

 This is incredible.

 I mean, so many great ideas here.

 It feels like maybe The Pepperwood Chronicles could be, like, a whole series.

 Well, I mean, it's called The Pepperwood Chronicles, so I assumed there'd be more than one.

 Yeah, well, I can't thank you guys enough.

 - All right, I'll see you at home.

 - Home?

 - You guys live together?

 - Yeah, we're roommates.

 Yeah.

 This job doesn't pay very much, but it's very rewarding to hang out with cool people like you guys.

 You guys are actually, like, friends?

 You ready to get your mind really bl*wn off?

 We used to date.

 - (girls exclaiming)

 - Oh, yeah.

 - Like, a whole thing.

 - Oh, my God.

 Oh, yeah, we were in love.

 Everything, yeah.

 For a while.

 (chuckles)

 All right, I'll see you at home.

 Yeah, it was crazy.

 - See you, guys.

 - Wow.

 You went from kind of "meh" to sort of cool to totally the coolest ever.

 I don't want to freak you out, but that really means a lot to me.

 - All right, let's get to class.

 - Let's get a picture with PJ.

 - Uh, what?

 PJ?

 - (camera clicks)

 Yeah, Principal Jess.

 Much as I'd love to foster your creativity, I think maybe Principal Jess or Principal Day Let's not even go to class.

 (laughter)

 Let's go to the drama room and dress up like old men.

 - PJ don't care.

 - Oh, PJ do care.

 PJ do care.

 I mean, your principal does care.

 How about we write a report on Pepperwood?

 You're hilarious.

 Yeah.

 You know I'm serious about the report.

 Don't walk away from me.

 Okay.

 Well, walk away.

 Just turn to the left.

 Point me out to your friends.

 Laugh a, laugh a little bit.

 Okay.

 Yeah.

 Keep going.

 All right, I've totally lost control.

 Ugh!

 Damn it!

 - Nick, I have to get to school!

 - I know.

 So do I.

 I can't wait to pitch those girls my Pepperwood prequel.

 It opens with a very graphic description of his birth.

 - It's like a dark Look Who's Talking.

 - No, no, no, no, Nick.

 You're not coming back to school with me.

 You made me look way too cool.

 The girls told the whole school.

 I've lost all my authority.

 (lively music playing, kids whooping)

 This is my office.

 I got invited to that, too.

 The girls asked me to deejay at their dance party.

 They call me DJ PJ.

 They love you.

 Isn't that what you wanted?

 Ah, it's a tricky balance.

 I don't want to be the heavy, but I need them to listen.

 Those girls have such good ideas.

 I've got to put the genie back in the bottle.

 - (phone vibrates)

 - Ugh!

 See, this is what I mean.

 They added me to a text chain about who has the cutest butt in school.

 - And?

 - It's Nurse Mike.

 - Interesting.

 - (door closes)

 Oh, you know what?

 If it's always gonna be empty, let's just fill it with goldfish.

 - So dramatic.

 - (phone chimes)

 Jeremy texted me and he left an ice coffee in the fridge.

 It's like this guy's in my mind.

 It's also like he's in our kitchen when we're sleeping.

 (clicking tongue)

 Can I come help you pack?

 Jeremy's done everything around here.

 Actually, I'm not packing, I'm just, uh, - hanging out with Winston.

 - I'm so bored, Cece.

 Please.

 I'm desperate.

 Are you guys having one of those mess-downs?

 I could come be part of that.

 Sir, I believe the correct term is "mess-around.

 " Okay.

 Jeremy, enough.

 Thank you very much.

 I appreciate it.

 That'll be all.

 Thank you.

 Thank you, thank you.

 (sighs)

 - JEREMY: Did you say something?

 - Jer-Jeremy!

 Enough!

 Dear Lord.

 You know, I wanted an assistant that was gonna anticipate my every need so I wouldn't have to yell, but now I'm yelling, because I have an assistant that's anticipating my every need, and I can't breathe!

 Work isn't everything, man.

 Just go meet yourself a girl.

 Or a, or a man.

 I don't know what you're into.

 You're very hard to read sexually.

 But please, Jeremy.

 That'll be all.

 - Thank you.

 - Sorry, sir.

 WINSTON and CECE: Furguson.

 Hey, boy.

 - Sweatshirt.

 Sweatshirt.

 - Furgie.

 - Whee!

 - Ah, there we go.



 Hey, remember all of the good times we had?

 - So may good times.

 - Huh?

 WINSTON: What about one of those times we wore the same shirt?

 - CECE: Custom shirts.

 - (laughs)

 Dad of the year.

 - Dad of the year.

 - GIL: Come on, Sweatshirt.

 Hey, what about the time that we geeked out on mayonnaise?

 Or how 'bout when we drove to the airport and kissed, watching the planes take off.

 - You did what?

 - Remember that?

 - She's moving.

 She's moving closer.

 - No, no, no.

 If you're moving - then we get to come closer, too.

 - Yeah.

 We're coming closer, too.

 Sweatshirt Hey, boy.

 - Furguson.

 - (sniffing)

 - What?

 - I don't know.

 Someone has crab in their pocket.

 - Oh, my God, that's insane.

 - Yeah, time-out.

 - (sniffing continues)

 - That's totally crazy.

 Excuse Okay how does Okay, just (gasps)

 - Cheater!

 - Oh.

 Okay, well, that is from a salad I had earlier, and it must've just fallen into my pocket.

 Cece.

 I can't believe you did this.

 It's just (sighs)

 Okay.

 This is gonna be our last mess-around before I leave, and I just don't want Furguson to leave you, too.

 Just because you stop living together doesn't mean you stop caring about somebody.

 Because caring that is the real mess-around.

 Come on.

 (crying softly)

 Winnie.

 Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie!

 (gasping)

 - Oh, my God.

 - (gasps)

 WINSTON: He chose.

 - Ha!

 - Yeah.

 - Ha-ha-ha, you see?

 - Ha-oh!

 - The crab claw didn't matter.

 - Mm-mm.

 WINSTON: Furgie chose.

 Outta sight!

 (laughs)

 Come here, my man.

 Ah!

 (laughing)

 Aw.

 Well, I suppose what's done is done.

 He's all yours.

 Good-bye, Sweat (sighs)

 Good-bye, Furguson.

 Yeah.

 (chuckles softly)

 Do you guys think it's cool or weird if, uh, Pepperwood has a peg leg?

 Where we at on that?

 I'm afraid it might make him too vulnerable.

 I just don't see it that way.

 I think it makes All right.

 No peg leg, I guess.

 Excuse me!

 There's an assembl Nick!

 What the hell is going on here?

 Oh, PJ in the house!

 My office.

 Now.

 Oh, PJ's gonna bust somebody.

 You're the most in trouble.

 But they started it!

 I didn't even do any Gah!

 You had an unsupervised meeting with the students.

 You're wearing home slippers - on school grounds.

 - (scoffs)

 Home slippers.

 You parked in Janitor Margie's parking spot.

 And, by the way, she pissed.

 - And she ain't small.

 - It's a dirt patch.

 And you ladies, you skipped an assembly for Pepperwood!

 What's the big deal, PJ?

 Yeah, you're kind of being a bitch.

 This is unacceptable.

 I don't want to be your enemy, but I also don't need to be your friend.

 So you guys don't get to write to your international pen pals for a month.

 You've all lost your community garden privileges.

 Two weeks' suspension from the freestyle poetry slam.

 And I'm calling all of your parents.

 Spread the word!

 Principal Day is done messing around.

 Now get out.

 (phone beeps)

 Oh, my God, they work fast.

 When did they even take this picture?

 Well, apart from the devil horns, it's a pretty good picture of you, Jess.

 That's true.

 I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

 The truth is-is you are exactly who I was when I was your age.

 I was hungry.

 I was putting in 22 hours a day.

 Once worked four days straight without water.

 Wow.

 And I just wish that somebody had taken me aside and told me that there was another way.

 Would you have listened?

 (sighs)

 - Probably not.

 - Then I won't either.

 In fact, you're not even talking to Jeremy right now.

 - Okay, well, then who am I talking to?

 - The younger you telling you to take advantage of your new super cool assistant so you can get to the next floor and the next floor and the next floor, and the next floor and the next floor, - and now we're on top!

 - And now we're on top!

 I'm liking this side of you, Jeremy.

 Yeah, let's stay hungry.

 I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna work on the McCormick presentation.

 Now I actually am hungry.

 Let's order some food.

 Already done, sir.

 Arigato.

 (speaking Japanese)

 All right, now.

 Take it down a notch.

 Yeah.

 If you're here to complain about your punishment, save your breath.

 My decision's final.

 Actually, we were just wondering if we could sit down with you for a second.

 - Sure.

 - We're sorry about being so disrespectful, Principal Day.

 Well, I appreciate that.

 If anyone wants a muffin, I I have an extra one.

 GERTIE: Here.

 We got you a gift card to a coffee shop.

 It's really close to your route to school.

 Well, that's not necessary.

 Th-Thank you.

 That's RAMONA: We know you have a lot of roommates, and some of them are brilliant authors working from home, creating great chronicles.

 But they can make their own coffee.

 Well, that feels oddly on the nose.

 We have the upmost respect for you.

 Sorry, did you just say "upmost"?

 - Oh, that is good.

 - JESS: Nick!

 I can't condone you making contact with my students.

 - What?

 - That said thanks for putting them up to it.

 Jess, I don't know what you're talking about.

 "Upmost"?

 There's only one person I know that says "upmost.

 " - It's "utmost.

 " - "Utmost"?

 - "Utmost.

 " - (chuckles)

 Agree to disagree.

 But the good news is my writer's block is gone, and that is thanks to you.

 You always come through for me, Jess, to the upmost.

 I assure you, it's "utmost.

 " - What's an "ut"?

 - Come on, you're a writer.

 It's "up.

 " Up to the most.

 Not ut to the most.

 I assure you.

 - Okay, sweetie.

 - You didn't come in here and say, "Thanks for putting them ut to it.

 " I would've laughed you out of here.

 What is an "ut"?!

 WINSTON: Furguson is miserable.

 JESS: So you're saying that this is a different emotion than we've seen for the past three years?

 A father knows.

 He misses Gil.

 It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.

 I mean, I already took away his testicles.

 Anyway, (sighs)

 let me just Proud of you.

 (sighs)

 You won't need the key I gave you.

 And the door always gonna be open.

 You're not gonna, like, leave the door open always, right?

 He'll be back.

 What the hell?

 - Jeremy.

 - Oh, my God.

 He came back.

 Come on.

 What the hell is this man doing in our house?

 Let me introduce myself.

 My name is Jeremy.

 I'm the executive assistant to your husband and my boss, Mr.

 Schmidt.

 Oh, are you the one who called and asked me about my blood type?

 He's very thorough.

 Actually, he's going to need everyone's blood type.

 - You're not getting my blood.

 - That's super weird.

 - Yeah.

 - Oh, hell no.

 I do have individual coffee orders.

 You can tell which one's which based off the caricatures I drew on the cups.

 That's you.

 This is shockingly accurate.

 And you've never met us.

 - I mean, how did you do that?

 - Nailed it.

 - Very creepy.

 - That's pretty good.

 (chuckles)

 CECE: Is he ever gonna leave?

 SCHMIDT: I don't think so.





I can't believe we still haven't told them.  

I guess it just was never the right time.  

Well, I guess we're simply out of time.  

(phone rings)  

- You're on with Schmidt and Cece.
- Ruth's on!  

JESS: Hey, you're on with Jess and Nick. I'm patching in 

Winston, Aly and Dan Bill. 

Are we really calling him Dan Bill?  

It sounds like a weird town in Connecticut.   

It's their child. Their mistake to make, okay?   

- (Muzak playing)
- Mm. That's a nice touch.   

CECE: Yeah, good vibe, good vibe.   

- Hella?
- JESS: It's Jess and Nick. 

- I'm patching in Schmidt, Cece and Ruth.
- (beeps) 

Cece, Schmidt and Ruth, you're on with Jess, Nick,   

Winston, Aly and Dan Bill.   

- Hey, Jess, Nick, Dan Bill...
- Hey, Winston, Dan Bill...   

- Winston and Aly.
- Jess and Nick.   

Who are these people?   

Hey, Schmidt, Cece, Ruth, Jess and Nick.   

JESS: Guys, I only have the strength 

to say this once.   

Here I go.   

Oh, God, how do I put this into words? 

Okay, make it quick, 'cause my phone is at four percent,   

and Ruth has turned my charger into a very sensible belt.   

Schmidt, just switch your phone to low battery mode.   

It really lengthens battery life.   

How do you do that? Walk me through it.   

- Go to Utilities.
- No, no, Settings. Go to Settings. 

Okay, well, I'm-I'm in Settings.   

- Guys, please...
- Oh, sh**t. Now I'm at three percent.   

I have something important to say!   

WINSTON: And then, uh, open your Control Center. 

- Battery. Select Battery.
- Enough!   

- Oh, no, I got it.
- Jess has something really important to say, so everybody shut up!   

Jess, go ahead.   

(groans)
I can't tell you this over the phone.   

Get over here before it's too late.   

She can tell you, she can tell you. Go ahead.   

- Bye.
- Oh! What a waste of...   

Good job.   

- What is it?
- You're getting divorced?   

Well, that lasted a month.   

What? No! Jess, go ahead.   

I hate to be the bearer of truly terrible news...   

Jess, can you please tell us? I'm so scared.   

You should be. This is...   

(sighs) this is life-changing stuff.   

Brace yourselves.   

Nick and I are...   

moving out of the loft.   

- That's it?
- Okay.   

SCHMIDT: That's what you called us here for?   

Why do you always think like a character   

- in The Baby-Sitters Club?
- (Cece sighs)   

Okay, okay, you guys process this
however you need to.   

You're probably wondering why we would ever move out   

- in the first place.
- Yeah, honey, you should've moved out   

when the elevator plunged into the basement   

- and k*lled the mailman.
- We got an eviction notice.   

They're kicking us out in    hours.   

Some evil company called Engram Pattersky Management Group   

bought the building.   

Yeah, they're kicking us out on our... "too-tookuses."   

You trying to say "tuchases"?   

"Tuchaseses."   

- "Tuchas"?
- "Tookases."   

Luckily, Nick and I found a very nice two-bedroom   

with a lovely reading nook. That doesn't matter.   

The point is, we're moving out tomorrow,   

and I know how much this place means to you guys, so...   

whatever you're thinking or feeling,   

I want you to get it out.   

So whoever wants to go first...   

Okay, I don't think you guys fully heard me.   

(chuckles) So I'm gonna say it again.   

Nick and I are m...   

...moving out of the loft.   

Okay, if you're moving out tomorrow,   

why have you not packed yet?   

Don't packing-shame us!
We're well on our way.   

We got four boxes right there.   

I ran out of tape, so I started using glue.   

We'll see how it holds up.   

Cool. Anyway, uh, I'm taking off.   

Hey, let me know when you have the housewarming   

for your new place. I'll bring the succulents.   

You never brought us succulents. We love succulents.   

Ah, you got me. I don't know what a succulent is.   

I just said that so I can get the hell out of here. (chuckles)   

But I really do got   

to get going. It's my turn to nurse the baby.   

- How does he...
- It's a whole thing.   

Wow, you guys are in so much denial. You're so upset   

by this news that you're distracting yourself   

with nonsense like-like succulents and newborn babies.    

Uh, we left Ruth with our neighbor's stepson, Yonk,    

so we're gonna go.    

CECE: Yeah, honey, we're not in denial, okay?    

We've just done everything we need to do in this loft.    

We're ready to say good-bye.    

Right. Right. Yeah.    

Yeah, Cece, you're right. You're totally right. You're all...    

totally right.    

Or are you wrong?!    

Nobody leaves until we celebrate this place!    

(groaning)    

Okay? So call your sitters, call your babies,    

get all your affairs in order.    

I'm gonna go open a bottle of wine. Pink okay?    

Well, I guess I'll call Yonk and tell him to get cozy.    

- (groans)
- Ugh, I can hear Yonk now.    

(with accent): "Mr. Schmidt, I got thirsty.    

I drank all your coconut water."    

Freakin' Yonk.    

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.    

Okay, why are we hiding in your office?    

Because, guys, look, I love my wife.    

You guys know that I love my wife. But she's clearly going    

through something about us leaving the loft. It's like...    

it's like she's having a really hard time getting her mouth    

around the sandwich, do you know what I mean?    

If you guys want to get out of here, which I know you do,    

then you will laugh when she says laugh,    

you will cry when she says cry,    

and in between, we're gonna pack.    

I really miss the old days when I would just drop in    

every now and then and pick up a suitcase or something.    

I only have the moving truck for    hours.    

If I go one minute over,    

those bastards will charge me for a whole nother day.    

If you get a whole nother day, might as well get a second week.    

You get a second week, you might as well buy the truck,    

'cause you're livin' in it, Charlie! You live in a mo...    

The point I'm trying to make is we need to pack right now.    

I love packing.    

You wouldn't believe how good I am    

at fitting multiple things into small spaces.    

- I'm a bento box boy.
- (chuckling)    

- What's in that box?
- What?    

What's the box that says "gross stuff," man?    

Jessica's underpants.    

SCHMIDT: You have Jess's panties in a box?    

Well, while I'm delighted    

that you have a box...    

labeled "gross stuff" of your wife's...    

undergarments, uh,    

I also feel like you may be lying to me.    

JESS: Yoo-hoo, guys! Yoo-hoo!    

Yoo-frickin'-hoo!    

Just remember, if you want to get out of here, play along.    

♪ ♪    

Behold!    

Objects from your past to make you remember and...    

Oh, God, the chair is still spinning. Oh, my God.    

You guys, I'm on a dolly.    

I'm on a greased up dolly, and I'm holding f*re.    

Guys, guys, guys, guys...    

If we scatter now, one of us can get out    

and bring help for the rest.    

Take in the memories.    

Let these objects be the milkshake    

that bring your memory boys to the emotion yard.    

- I swore we threw all this stuff away.
- Wow, I can't believe you    

- saved all this stuff. How cool is that?
- But we're really happy it's back.    

- We're all really happy. Thank you.
- Yeah.    

I knew you guys needed to say good-bye.    

(chuckles) Isn't it amazing how easy it is    

to do the right thing when you have no other alternative?    

Totally. (chuckles)    

Like this.    

Ah, the old loft candy dish.    

(inhales deeply)    

That's the cast from when I broke my penis.    

(screams) Shut up!    

You know, most people wouldn't want to revisit    

some of the more painful moments in their lives, but,    

you know what, Jess, thank you for this, 'cause I do.    

- Thank you.
- Oh, Schmidt, you take that.    

- (stammers)
- You're gonna want it.    

Honestly, it's your penis. You earned it.    

- Put it in your purse.
- Excuse me?    

- Go put it in your purse.
- I am not putting it in my purse.    

- Please, Cece, just put it in your purse.
- I am not gonna go put it...    

- We'll just leave it here.
- We'll put it right there.    

Remember this?    

- NICK: Oh! Looks just like us!
- (Cece laughs)    

- We always pose like that.
- Can we talk about those skin tones?    

Oh, Nick, this one is so special.    

- WINSTON: Wow.
- The wand I used to fix the, uh,    

garbage disposal. That one time.    

(voice breaking):
Did we find the garbage wand    

or did the garbage wand find us?    

I remember the day I found it. I thought,    

"Free stick."    

- Ha!
- Then I brought it home,    

and it fit into the sink hole.    

- Mm.
- And somewhere along    

the way, it fixed my heart hole.    

- It fixed your heart hole?
- So, thank you, stick.    

- SCHMIDT: Okay.
- CECE: I have a tear.    

- WINSTON: That about sums it up.
- Yeah.    

Jess, I will never,    

ever forget the night that you brought us    

all together to show us a bunch of our old trash.    

- CECE: We should let you pack.
- Okay.    

- Thank you.
- Thank you so...    

- No!
- Huh?    

No one's going anywhere.    

We're gonna do all the things in the loft    

that we haven't done before.    

- Like what?
- (scoffs)    

I can't believe we've never all stood out    

on the balcony together.    

You know who else liked balconies? h*tler.    

Let's go inside. Let's do more things.    

I can't believe you've never cleaned the oven, Cece.    

I think, I think if we just do this,    

and this, and turn it up real high...    

I heard that that could work.    

Yeah. What else should we do?    

We could all just pack and move Jess and I    

out of the loft; we've never done that.    

It's a joke. It's a joke for sentimentals.    

- It's a sentimental joke.
- Oh. I know.    

Th-This is a big one.    

You know, I've never looked around the corner,    

in the hallway past the bathroom. Like, what's over there?    

Oh my God, what is over there?    

- What is over there?
- Yeah.    

- Whose team are you on?
- I play for myself.    

It's just a wall.    

My turn. Cece and I need to use the urinals.    

Follow me.    

Oh, n-n-no, no, no, no, no.    

You just opened Pantera's box.    

We do not have time for this right now.    

We will get in...    

Peppermint lotion?    

It's for your feet.    

Yay. I love it.    

I knew it!    

- Nailed it.
- Great gift.    

Oh, I'm gonna get you one every year.    

And we're gonna be best friends forever.    

I just met you, like, a week ago.    

Uh, just 'cause it says "peppermint,"    

non-edible.    

I never would have thought to eat this lotion.    

Nicholas, I have been giving you that lotion    

- every year since we met.
- I know.    

I wanted you to experience soft feet for once in your life,    

- and you... and you lied to me.
- What did you want me to do?    

I had just met you when you first gave it to me.    

Then you actually gave me the lotion again the following year.    

And the lie got on top of me. And now I got all these bottles    

of lotion and I don't even know how to do this stuff.    

You don't know how to "do" foot lotion?    

What if I put it on and my feet get...    

I don't know, too wet and creamy?    

Has everything been a lie? Has this whole relationship...?    

Don't call it a relationship, it's a friendship.    

Don't belittle what we have by calling it a friendship.    

- No, please.
- Oh, we don't love each other in Chicago.    

We're just friends.    

Please, just get over this and help me pack.    

Sure. You've lied to me for years,    

but let's just ignore it so I can help you pack    

while humoring your wife    

- pretending to care.
- JESS: What?    

You guys were humoring me?    

Nick, you told everyone to pretend to care?    

Jess, it's not about that. It's about the truck.    

I didn't want to go a minute over the    hours,    

because then I, you know, I need to pay for a second day.    

Jess.    

Wait, Jess. I'm sorry.    

You guys were just playing along with this?    

I thought you were just starting to feel something.    

Wait. Am I the one who's in denial about leaving this place?    

Ugh, you sweet, goblin-eyed dum-dum.    

CECE: Babe, I think the rest of us    

have already made peace with this.    

No, I get it.    

I'm not mad. I just...    

People live together in apartments all the time.    

And you guys have lives and kids.    

And this is just a place.    

But to me, this is the place where I met all of you.    

- And that's...
- (sighs)    

...that's the best thing that...    

that ever happened to me, so...    

Consider yourselves freed.    

The lock never really worked, anyway.    

Put that down.    

We are not going anywhere.    

Yeah, we're gonna say good-bye all day.    

All day.    

- All day!
- What?    

- That's not it.
- You don't say it like that.    

It's like, all day. 

- All...
- All day!    

Guys, second day    

- of a moving truck on me.
- CECE: There we go.    

- SCHMIDT: That's a big step.
- Thank you.    

But I'm not doing the insurance. I won't do it. I can't do it.    

- It's a rip-off. It's a freakin' rip-off.

that I realized: I should have less salt in my diet.    

I should have less salt in my diet.    

That's beautiful, man. Stay healthy, baby.    

- Good memories.
- Oh, my God.    

This is the spot, where, for the weirdest minute of my life,    

I was super attracted to Winston.    

- No.
- We've all been there.    

It was my swimmer's body.    

Ooh. Ooh, hey.    

Yeah, they got me on bike duty today.    

My hammies need to get into some jammies    

because they are rock-hard.

I tore my anus. Oh.    

I was sitting right here when I first introduced you guys    

to my hilarious baby voice.    

Uh-oh, look who just woke up.    

(high-pitched): I'm a baby.    

I'm a baby    

and I need my milkie. Where's my Ba-ba?    

- What are you doing?
- Put that baby away.    

Babies can't talk. It's inherently flawed.    

And that's where I met you for the first time.    

- Aw.
- I remember you said    

that was one of your top five boners of all time.    

Do you remember you used to rank them?    

- Be quiet.
- It's just foot lotion.    

And right over there is where Cece and I    

had our first mess around.    

What? Don't tell them.    

It's time for the mess around

Clearly, he doesn't like all of this emotion.    

He doesn't have a heart in that butter tub

You think I don't got spots? I got spots.    

"Have." Have spots.    

Sorry. Go, keep go...    

This spot right here is where my best friend Schmidt and I    

moved a couch in.    

That happened in the living room, Nick.    

I know, I just don't want to get up.    

You got it? You got it?

You're telling me, man.    

What do you think's gonna happen here in the next...    

chunk of our lives?    

I don't know. I meet a nice lady.    

She wants to have a baby with me.    

What does she look like?    

- Sexy.

Keep going. Right off the jack.    

Just, like, you know, like, shows up,

- You know what I mean? Like...
- Yeah.    

wearing a beanie and, like, a little hoodie.    

You know what I mean?    

Like, sort of, like, an orangish-red hoodie.    

(chuckles)    

Anyway, man, I just wanted to say, uh...    

Oh.    

...all thanks.    

I'm done.    

Well, it's just lotion. It ain't gonna hurt you, now.    

(chuckles) Yeah, go ahead. Slap it in there.    

Wow, it's so frickin' creamy.    

This is what I've been telling you.    

It's really cool.    

- It actually kind of feels nice.
- (Jess chuckles)    

I mean, I got to say, I really like foot lotion.    

Thank you.    

They should make more foot lotion for your hand.    

Foot lotion hand.    

Or... foot-lotion hand.    

I don't know.    

You should use this for elbows.    

You should use lotion for dry parts of your skin.    

(chuckles)    

It's really creamy.    

For the first time in my life,    

I realize my feet could be more than w*apon.    

I love you, man.    

Oh, yeah, that's...    

Well, yeah, man. I, uh...

Guys, don't-don't put any pressure on him.    

No, what? Dude, you're not putting pressure on me.    

- It's something I want to say.
- You don't have to say it.    

I don't need to say anything. I want to say it.    

- You never said it before.
- I love you, man.    

- Yes! (laughs)
- Are you kidding me right now?    

- Go, Nick!
- Are you kidding me?    

- I love you, man. We're buddies.
- JESS: Yes!    

CECE: Really?    

Oh, my feet are so creamy.    

You were right. This is what it means

Welcome, everyone, to Big Dinner, where the news is big, and the dinner is regular size.

Not to be confused with Big Supper, where we eat dinner and we watch the movie Big.

The movie about a grown woman who has sex with a little boy?

What?

She didn't know.

Schmidt: Tonight we gather to celebrate Jess and I's final weekend inside the chrysalis of professional mediocrity before Monday, when we burst forth in fully pupated positions.

Director of...

Principal Day.

Non-Television, Non-Radio West Coast Marketing.

And Principal Day.

Sorry. I should have waited till the end.

What's "pupatated"?

Schmidt: Okay.

It's time for the rites of passage.

Ding, ding, ding. I have some Big Dinner news of my own.

Winston, sit down! The topics for Big Dinner have already been decided.

As you all know, Aly and I have recently become engaged.

(whistling, applause)

I receive all that love, and then I give it right back.

Anyway, as we were saying...

I got to finish this.

It's really important. In order to get married, I have commenced divorce proceedings... with my wife...

Rhonda, yeah.

Rhonda.

Ding, ding, ding, ding.

Real quick. I hate Rhonda.

(growls): Hey, that's my wife!

Such a good Harrison Ford.

Who you married as a prank.

Which, for the record, no one gets.

Nick: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

What the hell is going on here?

If everybody's jumping in, I'm gonna jump in.

Reagan says my room looks stupid, like a teenager lives there.

She's correct.

No one's authorized to ding, ding, ding except for Schmidt and I.

And you you're not supposed to say "ding, ding, ding" when you ding, ding, ding.

Schmidt: Guys, please.

These are all common topics.

This is why I proposed Common Lunch, but nobody showed up.

Don't yell at us 'cause you guys are freaking out about your new jobs.

I am not freaking out.

I have been preparing for this job ever since I was young enough to believe (chuckles): leprechauns were real.

Leprechauns are real.

Yeah, I caught one.

He caught one.

We're not having the freaking leprechaun debate right now; we'll be here for hours.

Leprechauns are real.

Now, it's time for the rites of passage.

Finally.

("Pomp and Circumstance" plays)

Oh.

Schmidt, I present to you... new set of business cards.

All right.

So proud of you.

Okay.

That took a lot less time than I thought it would.

All right. And now the donning of the principal's blazer.

Oh, the principal's blazer.

I remember when you got that ten years ago and promised you would never wear it till you were actually principal.

Principal Day.

(applause)

You okay?

I don't think it fits.

No, no, you look great.

Everything looks perfect to me.

Looks great.

Are you okay, honey?

I'm okay.

(sewing machine whirring)

It's the middle of the night.

Yeah, just making a few, uh, minor adjustments.

Have you seen my scissors?

Never mind. I have 32 seam rippers right here.

Are you okay?

(chuckles)

It's gonna be fine.

♪ ♪

Hey, Schmidt.

Can I get a second opinion on something?

Oh, about your room? Reagan's right.

You need to redecorate.

It looks like you live in an abandoned day care.

(chuckles): That is not what an abandoned day care looks like.

You can trust me.

Hello?

Can I take a nap now?

Okay, we need to talk about that a lot more later.

I'm worried about Jess.

I think she is freaking out about work and she's channeling all of it into her blazer.

She's got a real "cat in a bathtub" vibe.

Hey, guys!

I'm just blasting some Jock Jams, getting my fashion on!

What's the problem? This is Jess at a six.

Schmidt: Sorry there, Jess.

Jess: Mm-hmm.

Nick here says you're freaking out. What's going on, girl?

I am so good.

I am "saw" good.

I am so "gawd."

So "gawd."

We can't let her go to work on Monday like that.

Remember what I used to do for you in college when you'd get nervous about exams?

What did I do for you? What was that thing called?

Boy ride!

Rumspringa!

What?

Rumspringa.

I said "Rumspringa."

So did I.

No, you said "boy ride."

No, I said "Rumspringa."

What's a boy ride, dude?

Rumspringa, boy ride. Boy ride saved my life.

I would be freaking out, and you would take me on these wild adventures.

Bio exam?

Casino time.

(chuckles) Yeah.

Intro to environmental feminism?

I remember.

Corn maze.

That was the day we found out that corn is maize.

(imitates expl*si*n)

Do we take Jess on a little Rumspringa?

Cece: Can you just give me, like, a five-minute warning before Rhonda gets here?

I'd like to be... not here.

Look, Rhonda shows up when Rhonda shows up.

I know. That's the problem.

There's nothing I hate more than women talking about their rings in a high-pitched voice, (high-pitched): but, oh, my God, I love my ring so much!

I love it!

Aw.

I love that ring on your finger.

I just want to bite it off and swallow it, and then digest it properly.

And then give it back to you in a day and a half.

Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna cry.

You guys have such a weird dynamic.

(both chuckle)

Rhonda: Hello, Winston.

Hey, Rhonda.

You wanted to sign the divorce papers, and-and I thought this was... this was a good a time as any.

But I know it's a shock, but... meet your son.

Oh, my God.

Um...

(chuckles)

Now, you listen to me, baby.

(chuckles)

My father walked out on me, and I swear...

I will never do that to you.

That's so sweet.

(whispering): You just got Rhonda'd.

Rhonda'd.

(chuckles)

(snickers)

No...

Oh, my God!

Did you just prank me with a baby?

(laughing): A human baby.

What the hell?

That is amazing!

Oh, my God.

Oh, I can feel my heartbeat through the back of my head!

You just took years off my life!

You are the master!

Where'd that baby come from?

Oh, he came from Dave.

Who's Dave?

Hi-yo!

Dave, take a bow.

Thank you. Uh, thank you.

Rhonda: This is my cousin.

I'm staying with him while I'm in town.

So he's your baby?

(chuckles): Oh, no.

I'm an obstetrician.

I just borrowed this little guy.

(laughter)

Rhonda, I'm Aly, Winston's fiancée.

It's so nice to meet you, I think.

All of us are coming down from this a little too quickly, 'cause what that guy did is a felony.

Congrats on your engagement.

Winston: Thank you.

No one cares.

But you can't do it without... these.

Thank God.

They 'bout to be "soined"!

(sighs)

The end to one of my best pranks.

Oh, this feels good. (Winston laughs)

Yeah.

That's it.

That's it.

All right.

Well, I better go.

I really hope you two are happy.

No prank.

So until we cross paths again...

She used disappearing ink.

What?

Girl pranked us.

I'm not doing anything!

Nick: Uh...

I'm going to bed soon!

Okay.

I also know that my jacket has three sleeves.

Wait a minute, when did I add a fourth sleeve?

Did you guys see me add a fourth arm?!

Why am I freaking out?!

First day jitters, Jess.

It's totally normal, and we have the answer.

Rumspringa.

Boy ride.

Rumspringa is a hallowed Amish tradition, not a one-day buddy comedy.

Second of all, I don't want to go to a casino or a sexual petting zoo.

That is why we are taking you to the old-timey Danish town oddly located in California's wine country.

Solvang!

Solvang!

Nick: It's a craft fair! You love craft fairs.

Jess: Candy apples, windmills, no minorities.

Great Rumspringa, guys! I'm gonna h*t the road.

I need to work on my blazer.

Well, I paid for all-day parking, so you're out of your mind if you think we're leaving now.

Jess, resistance is the classic first stage.

Just enjoy this! It's so cool.

Look at this sign. Look at this sign.

"When did it become a crime to rhyme all the time?" (laughs)

So true. (chuckles) And it's really funny.

Somebody just thought of that.

Do you think a teenager would hang this on his wall?

No.

I don't either.

I just got a vision for my room. Excuse me.

Okay, I got to go home, and I got to work on my morning announcement voice.

(softly): "My morning announcement voice."

(cheerily): "My morning announcement voice."

I think the last one was close.

I really think you're overthinking this.

Just do what I do... exude confidence all the time.

But you're the boss now. You... you can't skate by on confidence alone.

Who says I can't?

Well, I couldn't get away with it.

I'd always be worried that someone would figure out I didn't know what I was doing.

I'd be terrified as hell.

Nah. I'm good.

I'm so good.

Well, I'm not.

I have to go home and work on my blazer.

So I found a bus ticket back...

Well, hold on.

I think there's somebody that you would like to meet, Jess.

Man: Greetings, yon settlers three!

Are there folksy, old-timey reenactors here?

'Cause that would be, like, a total freaking game changer.

I am one of the founders of this town of Solvang, Professor P.P. Hornsyld.

Is this really what you're into?

And so begins phase two, enjoyment.

At your service.

I have 87 questions for you.

When were you born? When did you die?

Where were you born? Where did you die?

Are you a spirit? What do you think of the modern era?

What do you think of technology?

Perhaps you'd like to try some aquavit, a traditional drink from the motherland.

Perhaps you will enjoy its humors more than you enjoy peppering me with this endless barrage of questions.

(laughs)

(chuckles)

(laughs)

I can't believe you fell for the disappearing ink trick!

Ah, ha, ha!

That was Rhonda, that was Rhonda.

Rhonda? Grow up, stop acting like Dennis the freaking Menace, and sign the papers. The pranks stop right now.

I just wish I could've seen your face.

You are being a turd.

Aly hates pranks.

What?

Yeah.

Like a normal person.

No disrespect, Aly, but that's basic.

Okay.

That's very disrespectful.

Winston, I'm worried about you marrying her.

Here's a prank. I'm, I'm gon...

I'm gonna kick you in the head.

See, that's not a prank. See?

Winston, I'm worried.

Stop being... a turd!

Now we're never getting a divorce!

You're a crazy person.

It's just gonna be pranks for life!

What?

Pranks at 50, pranks at 60, Aly, ignore her. pranks at 80.

Pranks in the nursing home.

We'll figure something out.

Hey, you're small.

What?

I'm looking for somebody small for a prank I'm cooking up.

(exhales)

Actually, I could use all of you.

Winston: Okay, look. Rhonda, yeah. This won't work.

Aly, you don't have to do this.

Rhonda: If you do this for me, I'll give you your divorce.

If this is what I have to do to marry you, then...

Rhonda, the three of us will do your prank.

Cece: Wait, what? I have in no way consented to this.

Gonna do a group Rhonda! That's awesome.

Uh, how do you feel about having a bunch of jelly on your head?

Not good, Rhonda.


Hey, Jess.

Mm.

Could you make a pillow out of this?

You know damn well I could make a pillow out of anything.

Definite buy, bro. Aquavit me.

I'm thinking of making a throw pillow for my room.

Uh, teenagers don't have throw pillows, right?

Whoa. Why you packing up? It's only 4:30.

Yeah, it's Sunday.

Everything around here closes pretty early.

Sundays.

I'm just getting my rum sprung!

Stinks.

What am I gonna do, Nick?

I don't...

Nick, I don't think I'm ready for this new job.

I'm freaking out. And there's not enough aebleskivers in this whole place to soothe me.

It's not over. Give me a second.

Give me a second.

I think I know how to keep this party going just a little bit longer.

Welcome to the distillery.

I'm gonna, uh, make sure that, that's okay.

Oh, you know what? It's, um, it's probably just an old-timey Danish door.

You just need to jiggle the, um, the dorhandtag.

Yeah. I'm doing that.

Maybe there's another door.

(jiggling door knob)

No, that's it.

Are we trapped?

Wiggle the dorhandtag!

It won't budge! It's locked!

I'll make a call!

Oh, my God.

And there's no service!

Let us out! We have a big day tomorrow, we need to pupate.

They don't know what that means.

Say something more accessible.

Help!

They have Wi-Fi.

(Jess and Schmidt yelling)

But I don't know the password!

I'm on a real roller coaster of emotions right now.

Just slamming up and crashing down!

Jess: Come on, help us, Danes!

Unlike in World w*r II!

Yeah, I brought it up!

Darn it!

What are we gonna do?

We've been stuck in here for over an hour!

Okay, yes. Our bodies are trapped in this cellar, but our minds can go anywhere.

We have to start new jobs tomorrow.

Don't you know who I am? I'm the director of marketing for Associated Strategies!

Hey, Schmidt. It seems like you might need a Rumspringa.

Want to go to a casino?

Pick a number. Any number, kiddo.

What?

Pick a number.

I don't understand this...

23.

That's wrong.

Fun, though, huh?

How am I wrong?

Was it 19?

It was...

He doesn't need a Rumspringa!

He needs to get out of this cellar.

I think you're looking at it wrong.

There's still so much fun to be had in here.

For example, in three minutes, a bird is gonna pop out of that clock.

A bird?

Just gonna pop its head out.

Why wait?

What do you mean, why...

(cuckoo clock chiming)

Son of a...

Look, there. I got the bird.

Isn't this fun?

I told you I didn't want a Rumspringa.

This might've worked when you were 20, but we're adults now, and you can't handle adult problems by forgetting about them.

You're right.

Maybe I handle my problems like a child.

Maybe I decorate my room like a child.

I mean, I even undress like a child.

(grunting)

Do you think that's what Reagan was getting at about my room?

Yeah.

Do you think Reagan thinks I'm a child?

Mm-hmm.

Okay, now I'm freaking out!

And I'm usually the rock of this group.

Once you lose old Nicky Miller, the whole thing falls apart.

Winston: Aah.

Aah, okay.

Cece: She's gonna pop!

How far apart are the contractions?

Who's asking?

I don't know.

Let's take a look.

(screams)

Wah. I'm a baby.

Oh!

I'm, I'm... coming out.

Uh-uh.

I, I know.

I'm rattled, too.

You just got Rhonda'd!

That's for not coming to the family reunion.

I'm so sorry. We got Rhonda'd.

Uh, Dave?

Hello. I, for one, would like to say I'm sorry.

Did not want to participate in this at all.

(Rhonda and Dave laugh)

Dave: You're crazy.

You got me good!

Oh, God.

W-what's happening?

My, my skin... it's burning.

What? What's going on?

The goop, it's burning my skin.

What?

Do something. My skin's burning, you guys.

What? Baby, baby, you okay?

What did you put on me?

What did you do to her, Rhonda?!

Ow!

She didn't want the jelly, so I used a porcine birthing agent.

What is that?!

I... I...

Well, it's burning!

Oh, my God!

I'm so sorry.

You're sorry?!

I...

You should be... because, baby doll, you just got Aly'd.

Oh!

Oh!

Ooh!

How you like that, Rhonda?

Who's basic now?

What?

Oh, my God.

Oh!

Winston: Oh, my God, I thought you were about to die. My heart...

She good.

I d*ed.

How could you... do something... so amazing?!

(Rhonda shouts)

Just kind of thought of it on the spot.

Oh, now, not only will you get a divorce, you have my blessing.

Put your hands away. Nobody's asking for it.

We don't need that.

(broken clock whirring)

Jess: Well... it's 4:00 a.m.

It's official.

I'm missing my first day as principal.

Got a fresh toilet for you guys. (clears throat)

Ration them.

Guys, don't give up hope.

Well, I'm fine being trapped.

I don't want to go to work.

Look, we're gonna get out of here, and when we do, I'm gonna start... I'm gonna start growing up.

You have grown up, Nick.

I mean, you own a bar.

You wrote a novel.

I'm talking about really growing up.

There's still so much I want to do, like...

I want to try cilantro.

(Schmidt urinating)

You haven't tried cilantro?

I want to figure out what NASDAQ means.

You've never had salsa?

I want to not shimmy out of my pants.

Feels good being empty.

I'm sorry I kidnapped you, Jess.

I just hated to see you with first-day jitters.

What is wrong with me?

I've been preparing for this job my entire life.

I mean... maybe this'll help.

A bottle of champagne. (laughs)

A toast to the new principal, right?

Should we?

Is that a bottle of Krug Clos d'Camaret-du-sur Mer?

Yeah, it absolutely is a bottle of "Klus Clos de Saminaire."

Little known fact about the late '90s Krug Clos d'Camaret-sur-Mer.

According to my father, they have very strong wire around the cork.

Well, that anecdote's ready to go.

Uncork it, Nick.

Go, go, go.

Look at that.

It's like a key.

Almost exactly like a key.

Uh-huh, yep.

(wire jiggling)

Okay.

(latch clicks)

I did it!

Oh.

I didn't even need to prepare for it.

When Schmidt's back is up against the wall, Schmidt shows up because I have confidence and skill.

Yeah, yeah, finish your epiphany on the way.

We got to go. We got to go.

Let's go to Ass Strat.

Okay, two more hours before... morning announcements.

I think we can still make it if we take zero pee or snack breaks.

Don't worry, I have five toilets.

I'm still too drunk. I can't drive.

All right, drunk check.

Drunk.

Drunk.

All: Crap!

I'm sure glad we exchanged numbers yesterday.

Really worked out, huh?

Yeah.

So, you guys can really get me on The Price Is Right.

Ja.

Drew is a good friend.

Road trip!

Boy ride! Boy ride!

Boy ride!

(laughing): Oh.

Please, can we just go?

The divorce papers are finalized. Good news.

There's no way this could be disappearing ink, right?

Well, I mean, the longest disappearing ink on record is only 42 minutes, so... no, we're good.

Great.

I actually had a good time pranking Rhonda.

No, not you, too. Please.

I mean it. I think we can kind of... get into this as a couple.

We'll prank, have some sex...

Mm... prank people, have some more sex, pet the cat. I'm okay with that life.

I don't understand how any human being could enjoy it.

Well, because we are pranks, don't you see?

Huh?

In the Bible, God created light and dark.

And then separated the heavens from the oceans.

Then created plants, then animals.

And the animals, they thought they had all this cool stuff to themselves, but then God pranked the animals with us.

And it was good.

(whispering): That was so sexy.

Mm-hmm.

That was so sexy.

Winston: I know it was.

Mm-hmm. You like that?

I didn't know you knew all that.

Mm-hmm.

Trick's on me, that's for sure.

What? Why are there adoption papers in here?

Hmm?

What?

There are adoption papers in here.

What?

Let me see this.

Oh, holy hell, Rhonda adopted Aly...

What?

...in Liberia.

In Liberia?

No, no, this doesn't make any sense.

(groaning lightly)

"Dear Aly, please accept these divorce papers as an engagement gift from Mom."

Ew. She said "Mom"?

I mean, I guess that's a good prank.

You're my stepdad?

I'm so confused by what qualifies, I honestly can't weigh in.

I hate my Liberian mom.

Come here.

Okay, Winston.

Uh-oh.

Not now.

That's so crazy. Let's just...

Winston.

Okay.

Not now.

Jess: We made it, and I didn't puke in the car.

(tires screech)

Can we offer you any money for the bus ride home?

What about The Price Is Right?

We lied.

We have no connection to The Price Is Right.

Nobody knows Drew. He-he's a hermit.

You watched me call my mom.

How about $300 to get out of the car?

It's a good deal.

Shut up.

All right, as soon as you step out of this car, Jess, you're gonna be a principal.

It's... holiday. School's closed.

Why are all the kids going in?

Yeah.

If it's... if the school is closed, why are all these little kids going in?

I agree.

No, I'm asking you.

We should just go.

What are you talking about, Jess? It's...

Get out there, you're gonna be late.

Schmidt, can I get a... a minute alone with Jess?

Would you please take the pee bottles with you?

Sure.

A grown man standing around a bunch of ten-year-olds, holding bottles of his own urine.

What could go wrong?

Well, I think I know what's going on with you, Jess.

I mean, you've always been on this path, and now that you're at the end of it, and you've reached the goal, you know, it's a little scary.

Yeah, it's pretty stupid, huh?

No, I don't think it's stupid.

And as a guy who has never had a path like that, I'm personally really excited to see what happens next.

You know what? I'm gonna get out of this car... and I'm gonna go be principal.

Oh. I forgot my blazer.

Way ahead of you, Jess.

Oh. But you were gonna make a pillow out of that.

Ah, it won't fit in my room.

It's not a good style for me.

(chuckles)

It looks great on you.

Thanks, it fits perfectly.

And, Nick, I... I like your room the way it is.

It already has a style. It's you.

Okay, get to class kids.

Only five minutes till... morning announcements.

Go get 'em, Principal Day!

Morning announcements. Morning announcements.

Nailed it.

Morning announcements. Morning...





Valentine's Day!

Schmidt: Woo-hoo!

Yeah!

Oh!

♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪

Go left.

♪ Do your dance ♪
♪ We got a brand-new dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪
♪ Do your dance ♪

(Nick whistling)

Oh, hey, what you doing?

Hey! Oh!

We wasn't doing nothing!

I love the "Cupid Shuffle."

Why'd you stop?

'Cause, uh...

This particular day...

Yeah, it's, like, romantic in nature.

Ugh, that stupid "sad single girl on Valentine's Day" cliché?

Do better.

I have a great day planned.

I'm finally gonna use the celebrity chef dinner that I won at the auction.

And before that, I'm gonna clean out my purse.

Dinner by yourself and cleaning out your purse?

Does that sound sad?

Mm-hmm.

Yes.

Oh, kiss it. It's gonna be great.

Hey, is there anything in there from Reagan?

She's in Minnesota, and we're exchanging gifts.

Gonna do the old stand-by, like when we were dating?

A nudie card with a $20 stapled to it?

I did so good.

No, no, no, I'm-I'm putting a real effort this year.

I feel five feet tall.

You're more than five feet right now.

I feel smaller because I'm humbled.

I'm humbled by my actions of tenderness.

Well, the only Valentine in this pile is for yours truly.

Someone very crafty made it.

She sent a Valentine's to herself.

Now, you understand this is sad, this is really sad.

Guys, would a sad person do this?

♪ Down, down, do your dance, do your dance, do your dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance ♪
♪ Do your dance, do your dance ♪
♪ Down, down, do your dance... ♪

Whew! Say what you want, that woman can shuffle. Mm!

♪ ♪

Can't believe that we're not spending Valentine's Day together.

I know. It sucks.

The first year that I haven't planned our bone-iversary.

I think I'd prefer to call it the anniversary of the first night we made love.

Either way, it's our first one as a married couple.

You know, we miss this, the next thing you know, we're making love once a year next to a Thomas Kinkade painting after a hot dog dinner.

It's not your fault, all right?

You've just been working so hard.

I've been k*lling myself trying to impress Kim.

Call the tween footwear people. Here's their number.

Don't trouble yourself. I've got it memorized.

You just dialed 17 numbers.

Loretta, I need you!

Freakin' Loretta!

Kim will take you seriously when she sees you in that fine-ass suit.

Ah, thank you. (sighs)

(chuckles)

How long have we been waiting for this elevator?

What, are we in the lobby of Sterling Cooper?

Hey, hey. What you doing?

Cleaning out your purse? Fun.

Mind if I watch?

Knock yourself out.

(chuckles) Whoo!

What you got there?

Is that a nail clipper?

What you gonna do with that?

Keep, throw away. Keep, throw away. (mumbling)

I'm going with keep, I'm going...

Oh! She's keeping it!

Oh, I get it... you think I'm sad.

Aren't you supposed to be with your girlfriend right now?

Aly's not big on V-Day.

What?

Yeah.

She says it makes her want to eat and successfully pass a nail.

Yeah. I love her so much.

And aren't you gonna propose to her?

Yeah, I am, in due time. But right now, I'm only on phase six of my 21-step proposal plan.

I'm months away.

And in case you were wondering if I'm under budget, I am not... by thousands of dollars.

Winston, no matter what Aly says, all girls love Valentine's Day.

Get your cupcake ass out of here and go make her feel special.

I can't miss this.

Leave me to my froyo cards.

God, I got to start going to the same place, you know.

Or else I'll never get a free one.

(door opens, closes)

Oh.

I'm alone.

I can't even imagine what Reagan got me.

'Cause I know she went, you know, at least as hard as I went, and I got to say, I went hard.

At 11:00, an 11-ounce steak will be sent to her room.

That's large.

At 12:00, a single rose will arrive.

At 1:00, the hotel manager is gonna come, he's gonna tell her there's a problem with her room, he's gonna take her to another room.

When she walks in that room, boom, it's filled with roses.

Damn, son.

It's a slightly worse room, but it's right near an ice machine.

I am proud of you. You're a real Big Boy Cupid.

Big Boy Cupid... I like that.

Say it again.

Big Boy Cupid!

I didn't like it that much that time.

Well, I'm very happy for you on your Valentine's Day.

Doesn't really feel like Valentine's Day to me.

Schmidt didn't get to plan our bone-iversary this year.

If he is too busy to plan the bone-iversary, then you've got to do it.

Okay. Sure, I guess I could step up my game.

Right? Good.

Right, yeah.

Okay, I'll try it, I'll do it.

That is some good advice.

Now my final bit of advice, and don't get sensitive on this, but you got to change that top... it's terrible.

And you got to throw sparkles on.

I think...

Sparkles are in.

I think my top is fine.

Sparkles...

... are in!

There's a line.

You giving me fashion advice...

Sparkles...

... is the line.

... are in!

(laughs)

Look, I know it's not much, but, um, you know, I just thought it would be nice to spend some... koala-ty time together.

Ew.

(Australian accent): G'Day, mate.

Oh, no.

What's a fit Sheila like you doing with this sticky joey?

You were right. I said I didn't want to do anything today, but this is pretty fun.

(British accent): Even though you forgot the Parmesan cheese.

Well, that's not what he would sound like.

I mean, if you're gonna say it, you might as well say it... the way he would...

(both laugh)

I can't even joke be mad at you, because you're so perfect.

Well, you're the most ridiculous person I've ever met.

(laughs)

But, you know, I honestly never get tired of you.

(chuckles)

Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but I don't even care, I'm just gonna say it.

Why don't we get married?

(laughs)

Nah...

(grunts)

You said no?

I have a proposal plan, okay?

A plan. You know what, and I would not be in this mess if it wasn't for you convincing me to do Valentine's Day in the first place!

I'm sorry, I'm just...

You know what, I'll just find her at work, okay?

And I'll-I'll tell her yes then.

I'm used to compromising my dreams.

No, Winston, you deserve an amazing engagement.

You're America's sweetheart, and you have to give Aly the proposal she deserves.

And you have to do it today, 'cause she's probably freaking out right now.

It's a 21-step plan.

I can't do it in one night.

You can't, but we can.

Jess, I can't make you do that.

I mean, you had a whole day planned.

I mean, it's a day I maintain was rooted in sadness.

You say I'm sad one more time, and I'm gonna take you to San Francisco, and we're gonna eat a little sourdough, maybe a little crab, and then I'm gonna throw you off the Golden Gate Bridge!

Do you understand?

Yes, ma'am.

Now, you go tell that son of a bitch cat of yours that he's gonna get a new mommy, 'cause we're gonna propose tonight!

Okay.

Okay, let's cut this 21-stage plan down to the essentials.

Okay.

Great binder, by the way.

You get it at Captain Work?

You know it.

Downtown or Third Street?

Downtown.

Good. Third Street's for idiots.

I'm really loving your vibe right now.

You're really taking control.

Yeah. Uh, okay, Malibu cactus picnic. Did that.

Erotic skywriting. That's a cut.

Mm. See, I'm not sure if you understood...

I know what erotic skywriting is.

It's in the sky.

Special performance by the L.A. Children's Choir?

They're gonna come out all cute and small, singing "Alison."

We're cutting.

Huh?

Okay, we can't get your ring in Atlanta.

It's the most affordable big city in America, so...

Well, I have a local ring guy, so it's Cut-lanta.

(sighs)

Operation Bobcat?

Let's call that "Operation Cut Cat."

No, no, no, no.

Oh, I should have said "Bob Cut."

Next time.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Move your hand. Don't rip that.

When Aly and I were first partners, we got called to break up a drug deal in a bus station bathroom.

When we got there, wasn't nobody in there.

Just a bobcat.

Like, a bobcat running around.

I shrieked. Of course, I was afraid for my life.

But Aly... she, she just laughed. (chuckles)

Laughed and laughed and laughed.

And, you know, it was that moment that made me realize I wanted to make her laugh for the rest of her life.

And so, the plan... was to recreate that moment.

So...

You already have a bobcat costume, don't you?

I'm an oddball romantic.

You bought a bobcat costume before you got a ring?

You really toe the line between sweetness and insanity.

That's the whole thing.

Schmidt: I already e-mailed you the reports, but I know you love hard copies, and I love that about you.

Why?

Why?

All right.

Happy bone-iver...

So, actually, I'm going to, uh, double-check those hard copies, and I'm gonna bring them to you, 'cause I want to make sure that they're ready for your brilliant eyes.

(door closes)

Cece, what the hell are you doing in here?

Surprise!

(pictures clattering)

Cece, I love where your head's at.

Mm-hmm.

And I love where your body is at even more, but I-I can't.

What if I told you that I have the Star of David hidden somewhere on my body, and you have to find it?

Okay.

Okay. All right, let's do it.

But we got to do it really quick.

I'm gonna stay dressed and just poke out like a cuckoo clock.

Not here.

I got a whole thing planned.

(chuckles)

Happy bone-iversary. (chuckles)

Who would have thought the first moment that we ever were intimate with each other, you know?

Honey, we're on the clock here, and it's getting very cold, so why don't we get this car started.

(wind whistling)

(chuckles)

Oh! No, no, no!

Oh! Oh!

What?!

My executive ensemble!

Both: No, no, no!

(grunts)

Thank you for coming, Trevlo.

Hey, got to sell these rings.

Driving towards success.

We blessed.

You're always so positive, Trevlo.

Got to stay positive.

Stay blessed.

Stay blessed.

Yeah, blessings.

(whispers): Blessings raining down on you.

Oh.

I think, we got one, Trevlo!

$12,000? You out of your damn mind, man?

No, no, no.

You got to work with me, Trevlo.

Can't do it, baby.

Come on, Jess, you told me this dude was your friend.

Friend is a stretch. I rear-ended him in a drive-thru, and he gave me his card.

Blessings.

What?!

What?!

What the hell you do to my fade, Jess?!

I said a soft blend! Soft!

I think it looks great, baby. It's all your perception.

I look like if LeBron James turned around.

Calm down.

Look, I'm trying to stay calm, Jess, but I'm trying to fit a 21-step plan into three hours.

Stay blessed.

I swear I'm gonna shove one of those blessings right up...

Trevlo! I thought that was you!

Wow, look at you. Looking trim.

Been counting my steps, baby.

You know Trevlo, too?

Yeah, I was in the car when Jess h*t him.

Stay blessed.

Stay blessed.

Stay blessed.

Everybody stay blessed.

Stay blessed.

Anyway, Schmidt's having a Valentine's Day emergency, and he called on Big Boy Cupid for help.

Cece's been calling me Big Boy Cupid because I'm super romantic now.

What can I say? I'm in love.

Trevlo: Nick, you in love?

Tell me about her.

Is she positive?

She is not positive, but I can't wait to see what she got me for Valentine's Day.

You know what?

Can't do it. The proposal is off.

What?!

I feel like I'm being a bad friend by putting you in this spot.

What spot?

Jess, I saw your face when Nick said he was in love.

Didn't have a face.

Yes, you're sad.

I'm not sad.

Please, everyone, stop telling me I'm sad!

A proposal is the last thing that you should be doing.

I'm calling it.

Come on!

We don't have a ring, we're rushing through all the steps.

It's better this way.

I'll come up with a plan B, I'll make it up to her for Valentine's Day.

You got to take care of yourself.

I feel very, very happy.

Stay home, relax.

Have your meal with your private chef, and more than anything... stay blessed.

Don't tell me to stay blessed.

You stay blessed!

♪ Stay blessed! ♪


You know, it's still our bone-iversary.

I'm too stressed.

Sex right now would be like picking a lock with a cold, wet French fry.

Nick. Nick!

What?

(whistles, caws)

Nick! Finally.

Nick!

I couldn't see you. This thing was blocking me.

Loretta's probably running the company by now.

Get over here!

Sorry I'm late.

There was a TV crew by the Staples Center, so I had to jump around behind the guy to get on TV, but the good news, I got on TV, so I think I'm gonna be on the news.

Great.

What do you got?

Here, I got this for you, man. You got some pants.

Got a suit jacket.

You brought that suit?!

It's a 62 short.

I wore that to college graduation.

It was in your closet!

As motivation!

Here you go, Cece. It's a beautiful dress.

My wedding dress?!

Ah, it's your wedding dress? I knew it looked familiar.

'Cause you were at the wedding!

You're a buffoon idiot.

Oh, my God, it's Kim. It's Kim. It's Kim. Shh.

Shh, shh.

(crying)

This is the start of a very long cry.

As a bartender, you really get to know the human cry.

(continues crying)

(sighs) So what else is going on with you guys?

(food sizzling)

So is it just you?

Yup.

You know I'm quite famous, and you didn't want anybody else to experience my food?

No.

Just me. Just my day.

Are you sad 'cause you're on your own, on Valentine's night?

Ugh!

Don't you start with me, Gordon Ramsay!

I'm having just a great time.

Liar!

Sorry. Bad habit.

Just bring me the scallops, please.

Impatient.

Mmm. Delicious.

(sighs)

Scallops... aren't...

(dish shatters)

... for liars.

Why are you sad?

I'm not sad.

Then what are you?

I'm mad!

There it is.

I'm mad that Nick just decided to be a great boyfriend.

Where does all this effort come from?

Reagan gets Mr. Cupid, and I got, like, some nudie card.

This bread is incredible.

You taste the crust?

It's really good.

And you know what else pisses me off?

The fact that everyone thinks I'm sad.

I mean, Winston canceled his engagement 'cause of it.

Then bloody do something about it!

Brilliant! Uh, just a reminder: I'm not required to clean up.

Winston can't throw away his dreams because of me!

Then don't let him.

Hey, Jess, what's up?

Winston, I'm not sad. I'm mad!

Bloody brilliant.

Okay. Cool.

Thanks for the call.

I'm not letting you throw away your dreams, okay?

You're proposing in that bus station bathroom, and I am going to help you.

I'll meet you there in one hour, and I'm bringing the bobcat suit.

Bobcat suit?

Thank God, because my plan B was weak!

(grunts)

(sighs)

(grunts)

(whoops)

(chuckles): I'm the man.

Cece: Okay, she's not looking. Come on, let's go.

We can go now, we can go.

No, don't move.

If we move, we... I'm-I'm fired.

Nick: She's not gonna get off this roof.

I know how to handle this.

Are you out of your mind?

You're just gonna materialize out of thin air on a rooftop?

Easy. I work here. I'm a window washer, and I finally got to the top floor.

You don't like that one? How about this one?

I'm a traffic guy, and I fell out of the news chopper.

What are you talking about?

All these work perfectly.

I'll just pick my favorite on the way over.

Sit down, you nincompoop.

This is completely my fault.

I just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.

And I just wanted to find some way to show you... how much I love you.

Instead, all I did was mess up your job.

(sighs)

Cece.

I'm sorry.

You mean more to me... than any job ever will.

Screw it.

Screw what? What?

(sighs)

(sniffles)

I love Cece!

Oh, well, then I love Schmidt!

I love him.

Love you.

Love you.

Well, this is a productive use of time.

What the hell is going on, Schmidt?

And what is that guy doing?

I'm a chimney sweep.

All these are clogged.

A chim...?

Clogged, clogged, clogged.

Are you crying? That's the question. Are you crying?

I just met my birth mother.

I don't have to explain myself to a chimney sweep.

Schmidt, why are you dressed like a Little Rascal?

The truth is it's... it's our bone-iversary.

(groans)

Kim, this job means so much to me, but... she means a lot more.

So... if this costs me the promotion, then...

I can live with that.

You know, this is the first conversation we've ever had where you weren't lying to me.

It's nice.

I'm not flaming with rage.

And by the way, I've noticed you're working your ass off.

Now get back to work.

Cece, your décolletage looks beautiful.

Thank you.

Okay. Yeah.

It cleans up pretty nice.

And this ring is perfect.

How did you get Trevlo to come down on the price?

I don't think it's a legitimate business, and that's the real answer.

Anyway, I got it done.

(chuckles)

Okay. I called the station, they're sending Aly down on a public disturbance call.

Nice.

I'm nervous, but, you know, I'm really glad we are doing this, you know.

If I didn't propose in a public bathroom while wearing a bobcat costume, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.

(indistinct police radio chatter)

Oh, here she comes.

Uh, put your head on.

Okay.

Oh, nice touch.

Police! You have five seconds to pull your pants up.

Your bus is leaving.

Come on, man. I'm having a really bad day.

(roars)

(screams)

(Winston groans)

Ah, that's a concussion.

Just a little bump, right?

What is going on?

Happy Valentine's Day.

What?

Jess, why did you decorate a bathroom?

Oh, boy.

Why is Winston dressed like a tiger?

He's dressed as a bobcat, but...

I got something I want to say.

When my head h*t the wall, it knocked my eyes out of focus.

So I'm gonna need you to read it for me.

Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

I'm still a little woozy.

Jess: Aly, um, look at Winston, but listen to me.

Um, fellas!

Choir: ♪ Alison... ♪

Okay.

You want to what... you want... now you want to what?

I'm not sad! These are happy tears.

Jess, I got this.

What was that last...

Wh-what did she say?

She just told me.

Look at this place!

You've got a wet bar, you've got a thermostat.

All right, Loretta, get out of here.

(door closes)

Happy anniversary.

Happy anniversary.

Hey. You got to come out here.

Winston's letting everyone try on the bobcat costume.

Oh. I'll be, I'll be right out.

Uh, my Valentine's Day gift from Reagan finally came.

That's nice.

Yeah. She got me a necklace.

(chuckles) Did you want a necklace?

No. Not really.

I don't know if I'm a necklace guy.

Well, some guys call it a chain.

A chain?

Yeah.

I call a chain the thing you put on tires in the snow.

Oh.

I got to say, I don't know what I expected from her, but it's definitely not this.

I'm sorry, Nick. If it makes you feel any better, I spent the day cleaning blood off of a wall in a bus station bathroom.

(chuckles)

Well, Happy Valentine's Day, Jess.

Happy Valentine's Day, Miller.

To the happy couple.

All: Cheers.

Oh.

Come on.

Oh, he's still concussed.

Oh.

Mm-hmm.

To a beautiful engagement you probably won't remember.

Cheers.

Cheers.

Cece: You haven't tasted a drop.

Winston: It won't go in.

Nick: Then stop doing it!





Well, this is the last of Robby's stuff.

How you doing with the breakup?

Really well, since we're related, and all the laws of nature say we should not be together.

If you guys need me today, I'll be in my room rearranging my furniture so it no longer resembles a place where I made out with my cousin.

(all groaning)

Third cousin.

Still.

Ugh, barely better.

Ew.

Don't normalize it, Jess.

Ugh.

You're right, you're right.

Ugh.

Hey, Nick.

Are you wearing your running bottoms and your hoodie?

Nick, are you going running?

Have fun.

Oh, my God. What is wrong with Nick, Reagan?

Yeah, what happened? Are you guys okay?

Nick is going for a run. (chuckles)

If anything, we should be asking what is right with Nick.

He only goes running if he's upset.

And he's wearing his sad hoodie.

And by the looks of it, it's been washed, which is bone-chilling.

He's fine. Everything's okay.

I just passed Nick on the street running, on purpose!

Oh, my God!

Maybe I was wrong.

Nick! Are you okay?!

I see you!

And I love you!

In my defense, no one here emotes in a normal way.

That's fair.

Nick!

How's the boba?

It's fine.

Why are you making so much eye contact with us?

Oh, you're gonna ask us for something, aren't you?

The boba is a metaphor.

Aly is the tapioca pearl to my milky matcha, each made better by the unlikely presence of the other.

I think you know what I'm saying...

We have absolutely no idea.

I haven't known what you've been saying for three and a half years.

I'm asking Aly to marry me.

What?!

Whoa!

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, my gosh!

Winston. My man!

(chuckles) Yeah.

Yes. (chuckles)

And I'm gonna need your help with the process.

Now, keep this between us.I  am only telling you two.

Yeah, we won't say a word. Yeah.

Whatever you need.

Meet me at the bar in one hour, okay?

Look fresh.

We'll discuss details. I'm gonna need you for the entire day.

We're with you.

Yes.

Little Winnie is growing up.

First he's a husband and then maybe one day he could be a father...

One day? (chuckles)

I am a father.

It's a cat, Winston.

He's my blood.

I am never gonna figure him out.

I feel like I found a forest baby, and I don't know when it's hungry or in pain or afraid of the kitchen light.

I know. (chuckles)

Nick is just an enigma wrapped up in a bunch of Chicago Bears crap.

You need the help of a seasoned vet.

(knocking at door)

Come in!

Hey, Nick.

Hey.

You feeling upset about something?

No. I'm just eating edamame.

Give me the cup. (spits)

They taste so bad.

That's what I thought.

I submitted The Pepperwood Chronicles to a publishing company, and I got the rejection letter today.

My career is over.

No, it's not.

Nick, someday you'll be talking to a reanimated Oprah about that book.

Have you talked to Reagan about this?

I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.

No, I am too embarrassed.

Nick, she's your girlfriend. You have to let her in.

Don't just keep her in the perfect front room.

Okay.

Let her in the back, with the weird rooms and the-the d*ad bulbs and the wet walls.

All right, but I'm not letting her go anywhere near my crawl space.

I don't think you should let anyone near your crawl space.

Well, some people have to go to the crawl space to clean out the boxes.

Who cleans out the boxes?

Significant other.

What are you talking about?

Hey. I have the scoop.

Nick's book got rejected, and he's really embarrassed.

So now the baton...

♪ has been passed... ♪

... to you.

You own an actual baton?

It was Robby's.

He was really into competitive male twirling.

I have so many questions...

No.

Winston: First, thank you for coming to this very special event.

Might I just add that everyone looks fresh.

Now, when Aly gets here, I am going to suggest an activity for the four of us to do.

Then I'll gracefully back out, leaving the two of you to distract her, as I prepare for... the show.

(giggling)

Ooh, I got a scream and nowhere to put it.

Ooh, this is exciting.

Now, at an undisclosed time, I will place a call to Aly, informing her that my car has broken down in Malibu, where I'll be waiting with a beautiful and glorious picnic right next to her favorite plant...  the common cactus.

Here comes that scream. Oh, my God, there she is.

Oh, I'm screaming already. Aly!

Hey.

Hey, hey.

Hey, hey.

Hi.

(giggling)

(chuckles)

Strange energy, guys.

(giggling continues)

We all had bubbly water. It made us giggle.

What's up? What's up? What's up?

Hi. Hello.

What's up?

Hi. Hello.

Hello.

Anyway, uh, Schmidt and Cece asked us to help paint their house.

Paint our house?

Paint the house.

Remember? That's the activity for all of us to do.

You know, 'cause you wanted... you wanted...

Paint the house. Paint the house. Yes, we... did.

Even though the majority of our house is already painted.

We wanted our best friends to finish it.

Not professionals.

Like, uh... like our new home was some tree house in a Little League baseball movie.

I mean, I-I've never done it before, but...

Sounds like a yes to me.

Aw, snap, just remembered, I can't make it.

Uh, uh, boo.

Uh... (exhales)

Yeah.

Boy, that's a bummer.

Shock. So fast.

sh**t.

Ugh.

But, you know, boo.

What up, boy in the hood?

I thought you were gonna talk to Reagan.

I tried, but she's been on her phone all day like a grandpa who missed a package.

Like... "Hel..."

I'm not even gonna do it.

Yes. Thank you so much. We will be there. Thanks.

Nick, I know that dumb publisher rejected your book.

And, guess what, that publisher can go to hell.

After you b*at them to death with this baton that I weirdly still have.

Because you don't need a publisher.

You need a girlfriend who found a bookstore... to sell Pepperwood.

Seriously?

That's amazing. That's amazing!

I called all over and I finally found one.

Reagan saved the day!

You're amazing.

That's right.

All we need is, uh, 30 copies of the book.

Oh, well, we can make them.

I mean, it'll be hard, but we could do it.

We could do it. We'll make 'em ourselves.

Fantastic. Uh, we just need 'em by tonight for his big reading.

Excuse me, did you say "big..."

"a big reading tonight"?

Yeah.

Well, that sounds... public.

Well, I mean, he's got to do a reading to sell the book.

Is that bad?

Is that bad?

No, it's good. I get...

I get to do a reading tonight in front of people.

Yeah.

I get to read in front of a bunch of people who are gonna judge me.

This is not bad. This is good. This is... (exhales)

Jess: See, this is another thing that Nick does when he's upset.

At least he's not running.

(clattering)

So you want me to read in front of people.

You want me to read in front of living people...

(voice squeaking): who are there to hear me read.

And how will I... how will I even know what to read?

You're gonna read your book.

I'll read my book. Fine.

This is good. I'm fine.

Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

Oh, I feel like my heart is pumping out scalding hot toilet water.

See, a vivid description like that is gonna make the audience go wild.

Ah, the audience! I just forgot the audience, and now I remember the audience.

I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't do it.

All right, here it is...

The Pepperwood Chronicles.

I made a prototype.

Jess, that looks fantastic!

That looks really good.

How did you do that?

Oh, that's between me and my craft wagon.

I wrote you.

Hey, um, how's he doing?

Not very good.

Hmm.

And if I'm being honest with you, I'm starting to freak out now.

This is me freaking out.

Do I sometimes wonder if you're a robot?

Yeah.

I've made you!

You're of me.

Jess: When Nick gets like this, he needs to be occupied.

Luckily, we have tons of books to make.

It's got my name in it.

Jess (sing-songy): Book time!

Gather around, my little Guttenbergs!

Here we go.

Hey, Jess, can I borrow your cactus gloves?

Ooh!

Making books, huh?

♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪
♪ I can fly twice as high ♪
♪ Take a look ♪
♪ It's in a book. ♪

Ah, you know the rest.

Just, we put... we put 'em there.

Backing away from an active craft project.

Are you okay?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

No. Um, Reagan's a little insecure about being there for Nick.

So I want her to have this.

Oh.

Wow. I'm proud of you.

Yeah.

Thanks.

(both laugh)

This is where you give me the cactus gloves.

This is really soothing.

You're a natural.

(whispering): She's terrible.

She's ruining our bedroom.

It's like she's begrudgingly covering up graffiti.

Oh, there's a couple rough patches, but... that's what posters are for.

Just calm down, okay? We can fix it later, but we have to keep her in here for Winston.

Hey. Since we're doing this, I got to say, do not like the color of your bathroom.

You know what?

Now that I think about it, me either.

(quietly): What?!

Let's do that next.

Great.

It's special order robin's egg.

It's just paint!

It's not just paint.

Hey, guys... as much as I love a good whisper fight, I should go.

Cece: Oh, no! No, no, no.

You, uh, can not leave.

Why not?

Because we can't be alone together.

Because...?

Because... because... we're having marital problems.

That's... secret, which is part of our marital problem.

She's got a big mouth, but a great can.

Which is also part of our marital problems.

I objectify her.

Aly: See. I knew something was up.

Everyone was like, "They're so perfect!"

And I was like, "No. Something in that relationship is very, very broken."

Hey, Nick. Where's Reagan?

Getting more glue. We ran out.

How many did you get done?

One... and I think we did it wrong.

It doesn't look right to me.

Your reading's in three hours! It...

Let's make some books! I think I have some really good glue in my non-mobile craft cart.

You're gonna help me?

Yeah!

Let's do it.

(both laugh)

God, this glue works great!

Oh, it smells great, too!

It really does.

(both sniffing)

(sniffing)

Oh, I love the smell of new books!

(sniffing)

(laughing): Yeah, me, too.

Mmm! New, new books.

New, new books!

Oh! Can I tell you something?I  feel great right now.

I feel very good. I feel very confident.

I am ready for that read.

I think you're gonna crush it.

I think I'll read the whole book in about two minutes.

Yeah. Just get in there. You'll...

(sputtering gibberish)

What?

What?

What?

What?

(sputtering gibberish)

And people are gonna go nuts.

(sputtering gibberish)

They're gonna be like, "Yes, yes, we love this book."

And they're gonna just buy every copy, and then you're gonna have to, like, print more.

That's what's gonna happen.

Does your hair always look like that?

Yeah.

Do you have brown hair?

Definitely.

Why didn't you tell me?

It's a secret.

(both laughing)

(cackling)

Check this out. I'm gonna birth this book.

(laughing)

(groaning)

Here you go. It's a baby book.

Oh!

(imitates baby crying)

Congratulations!

It's a paperback!


Hey, guys.

Reagan!

Reagan!

Reagan.

Reagan...!

(Reagan sighs, Jess and Nick laugh)

Sorry that took so long.

I got stuck behind this, uh, lady at the craft store that was buying 700 individually-priced buttons.

Mm.

Oh, they said to say hi to you.

Hi.

And I got you a new shirt, Nick.

Oh, isn't that nice.

Phew! What the hell is that smell, you guys?

We made a library!

Mm.

Is this the glue?

It comes from my private collection.

Mm-hmm.

It's very strong.

You guys are so high.

How dare you?

How dare you?

I'm not high at all.

You're high.

Whoa!

(clattering)

You guys, this says to use this in an open field.

It specifically says that a backyard is too small.

You're a backyard.

Very good.

(inhaling loudly)

I think I should cancel this reading.

No way!

I am in. I feel great for the reading.

Let me just buckle up my shirt.

Well, the problem with this author shirt is that it's made of honey.

It's not...

This shirt is too sticky.

It's because there's glue on your...

'Cause it's made of honey, so...

I'm canceling.

You cannot do a reading in this condition.

No! Don't cancel the reading!

You worked so hard to get it!

I got a backpack full of Pepperwoods, and I'm ready.

Nick: Oh!

Jess: Aah!

Jess, I'm coming!

Reagan, call g*n.

(groaning)

(groaning)

Are you pulling?

I can't feel you pulling.

Let me get your legs!

Please don't drag her.

(grunting)

(whispering): Winston, where are you?

We are freaking out in increasingly weird ways.

I'm at a costume shop, getting ready for the big proposal.

A costume shop?

All in good time.

Now, listen, when I text you, I need you to bring Aly to Malibu, okay?

I don't want the two of us to drive back separately.

Plus, I want to make out at red lights.

Okay, Winston. Just how much longer?

This is very important to me.

If you mess this up, you ruin my life, okay?

No, Winston. Uh, uh...

Okay, bye!

No. No, no, no. Uh...

Ooh!

So many marital problems we have.

My baby's got a real sweet tooth.

Just the other day, she ate an entire sleeve of pecan sandies... and punched the top right off of a parking meter.

(Cece clears her throat)

It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.

She yells at me constantly and... there's one time where she tipped over a table.

He gambled away another paycheck.

Oh, no!

It's the ponies. I'm addicted.

Right, right, right.

Cece: It's true.

All the money that he wins on gambling, he puts up his nose.

Oh.

It's cocaine now, as well.

Love me the ca-caine.

Ah, yeah.

Feel invisible when I do it.

This feels like some sort of weird foreplay.

I'm out of here.

Wait. No. Aly, please. Um...

Don't leave me with this rage monster.

Oh, yeah. You... I mean, you want to see a rage monster?

You want me to show her the rage monster?

Well, here you go.

No!

Just...

Gosh darn.

... tipping tables!

All right, that's...

Wait. Aly, Aly.

Uh, but I just...

Please don't leave.

She belongs in a mental hospital!

What?!

I know what's happening.

You guys are trying to distract me from some weird thing Winston's planning.

Uh, no. Aly, no.

Possibly a prank?

Might be a zotz, a goof.

If it's prank, please tell him I wore bad underwear today. Please.

Frank Sinatra strikes again.

It's a prank, it's a prank.

That's exactly what it is.

It's a prank. Great.

Oh. Winston.

Stranded in Malibu.

All right, let's get this over with.

Winston.

Hmm. Yep.

(Nick sighs)

The good news is I'm feeling sober.

The bad news is maybe I'm too sober.

Yeah. I'm sobered up, too.

Great.

Why are my eyes so good?

I can read everything from here.

What does that mean?

Oh, my God. A secret world.

Okay. I don't think she's sober at all.

(gasps)

Okay. Hi.

Thank you for supporting your local bookstore.

Quick reminder: we're dying. Please buy things.

I was feeling very confident before, but I'm losing some of it, so I think might just take one more quick pull.

No, no. No, no, no.

Just one more quick pull.

Just one more quick.

Oh, my goodness.

Is this gonna be a problem?

Get it together.

And now, please welcome Nick Miller, author of The Pepperwood Chronicles.

(whispering): No, no.

(applause)

Go ahead...

Nick.

Go ahead. They called...

What a wonderful day.

Quick reminder: we are dying.

I wrote this, every word.

All of that.

My hard work, not yours.

It's not a competition.

If everybody could stop looking at me, that'd be really great.

If you guys wouldn't mind just closing your eyes, as if you were at some sort of a show where you were asked to close your eyes.

What?

Thank you.

Do you mind looking down, sir?

(whispering): Nick.

All of these are for sale.

What's that? Yeah... coming.

Patron: Is that it?

Um...

Nick: Don't worry about me, I live here now.

All right, what are we gonna do? What's the plan?

Well, it helps if you feed him something first.

Do you have any meat? Or nuts?

Why would I have come to the bookstore with meat and nuts in my purse?

Okay. Caramels.

I don't have that.

All right. Just tell him you believe in him, and that he can do this.

Yeah. I'm not good at this.

Obviously. So... what would you say, Jess, if you were me?

I would say...

(sighs)

Nick, you're... one of the most amazing people I've ever met.

Everyone here is lucky to hear your book, because it's a part of you.

And if you fail, it doesn't change how special you are.

And no matter what happens here, I'll always love you.

Or something like that.

That made me tear up a little bit.

I'm gonna use that.

Okay.

Hi, Nick.

What are you doing?

I'm just hanging out in here. I'm just taking a break.

Just, just having a moment... yeah.

Hey. No. You are... you are amazing.

And you, you're, you're, uh, special boy.

Like, uh, um... you know, you... like, uh, you're, you are... very special, you know what I'm saying.

Uh, and let me start over.

(clears throat) Nick.

I believe in you.

Hey, this thing's awesome.

Did that guy write this?

Yeah. He sure did.

There's a sadness about him.

I know what you mean.

Jess: Oh, there's movement.

(sighs)

Sorry about that. Uh, that was some weird stuff.

"The sun baked down on Pepperwood's back as he moved over to the St. Charles streetcar. The driver handed him a brown paper sack. Without opening it, Pepperwood knew what was inside: blood-soaked beignets."

He is so dreamy.

Oh, your life's gonna be so hard.

Okay, Bishop, what is happening?

Do you really need a spare?

Oh, I got a spare.

A spare cactus.

Oh, my God.

I planted it in this spot that is perfect.

You see, the cactus is common, but the company is not.

Hello, beautiful.

It's perfect.

Come on.

We should probably just give them their privacy.

Yeah, you're right, you're right.

Holy hell. He's doing it.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

He's on a knee, here we go.

It's happening.

Game time.

It's a shoelace. False alarm.

Okay, now here it is.

Here it is. It's happening.

That is a ring.

I don't think that's a ring.

Is he giving her a gummy vitamin?

(Cece gasps) Okay, this is it, this is it.

And the other shoe?

That's why I double knot his laces.

You know what? Let's stop asking questions. Who knows?

It's... their date. It's their date.

What is this?

Hey. You guys can take off now.

Of course. You want to be alone for when you pop the question.

Got it.

Wait. What?

We're so excited for the both of you.

Oh. Oh, you thought I was gonna propose today?

No. Yo, that's hilarious.

What do you mean it's not today?

No. This is just phase one... of 20.

What?

What?

Yeah.

We went through all of this for a non-proposal cactus picnic?

Damn it, Winston.

My girl deserves the grandest proposal ever, okay?

And that cannot be rushed.

That is actually sweet.

That's not sweet.

I te... Here's a phase for you: When I throw you off the cliff into the ocean.

Okay.

Hey, look, don't worry.

For the next 20 weeks, I've only got you helping out with odd-numbered phases, okay?

And there will be sub-phases, obviously.

I ain't doing no sub-phases.

Think of them as annoyingly elaborate... smaller phases.

He's really pushing his limits right now.

Thank you so much for your help. One phase down.

Boop.

Don't boop him.

Just one. I wish we sold just one.

Hey. You did great.

Jess: Nick. I'd like to introduce you to your number one fan.

Hey. I really enjoyed what you read, and hearing it and how the characters were good, and how your face looks, and I want to hold it...

All right. Keep it cool, keep it cool.

I think Mariah would like to buy a copy of the book.

You want to buy one?

Yes.

How much ya got?

A dollar.

Well, the purchase price is $12.95, so...

I'm comfortable with the dollar.

Okay, fine. A dollar's fine.

Good deal.

The signature's free with the dollar.

There you go.

Thank you.

Don't read it all in one place.

You okay, Nick?

Yeah.

Just concerned about...

The shed scene.

... the shed scene.

But I don't remember the shed scene.

You don't remember the shed scene?

I don't remember it.

It's an incredibly graphic sexual scene.

That's not good.

Disgustingly sexual.

Who cares?

My first sale.

Reagan: Congratulations.

Nick: I did it.

Jess: Yeah, Nick!

Nick: Yeah, me!





Okay, we got our maps.

Yeah.

Got our canteens.

Yeah.

Got our trail mix, homemade of course.

Got my book of local fauna.

Got my book of local flora.

So we can identify...

Both: ♪ Every living thing. ♪

Schmidt: Look at them.

I feel like Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity, living in a house filled with clones.

It is the second time this week you've compared yourself to Andie MacDowell. It's weird.

I'll go grab... Our boots because we should... Break them in.

Exactly.

Nah, that's weird.

Robby and I are hiking Behar Pass tomorrow.

Turns out, we both love hiking.

It's amazing. We have a lot in common.

Aly and I are finally gonna have the same city in common.

Right on, man.

(Winston laughs)

Lefty's coming home. (laughs)

Lefty?

Lefty?

Yeah, she's left-footed.

I'm throwing Aly a surprise welcome-home dinner.

I invited her whole family here, you know.

Uh, I wanted her to see all the people she loves, which becomes love for me, you know, and the next thing you know, I'm getting one of those "best boyfriend ever" mugs, which you can buy, I just don't want to do all that.

I want to... I want to earn it.

You're inviting them over here?

Yeah.

Winston, this place is a hellhole.

Look at this. All the dishes are broken.

I'm eating pasta out of some thing that Jess and Robby made in a clay class.

Both: Pottery workshop.

What the hell is this compartment for?

I have a better idea.

Why don't you throw your thing at our place?

Ever since our wedding china came in, we've been dying to host a dinner party.

Is your house even done yet?

All the party zones are in working order: living room, dining room.

The master bedroom has sort of turned into a place where the workers throw all their trash.

I think even one of them went to the toilet in there.

But...

We'll just lock that door.

Yes.

Let's do it.

Reagan's out of town. You know what that means.

No.

What does that mean?

Honestly, I don't know, but please let me come to the party.

(gasps) Time to h*t the sack.

It's 6:30. Babies are still awake.

Both: Not this baby.

(Jess and Robby laugh)

I feel like I've lived through this before.

I'm like Andie MacDowell in Groundhog Day.

Stop! Just please stop.

Nick: Are you kidding me?

♪ ♪

Both (to the tune of "ice ice baby"): ♪ Hike, hike, baby. ♪

(imitating bass line)

Ooh, it's a fork.

Well, the map says to go left, but that little musket trail seems plumb adorable.

And it has a waterfall, so I say, uh.... waterfall.

(both chuckle)

I mean, let's just do it. Let's go nuts.

See, this is why we're so great together.

We agree on everything.

I agree.

(chuckles)

Hey, Robert Frost, looks like we're gonna take the road...

Jess traveled.

(both laugh)

All right, just, uh... that's not the way it goes.

Hold on.

Be easier if it wasn't so windy.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey.

Made a list of rules for our guests.

Obviously, no one's wearing shoes inside the house, but what if we put a foot-washing station in the driveway?

Babe, I was thinking maybe we have no rules.

Well, because growing up, all the cool houses didn't have rules, remember?

I was never invited to any of the cool houses.

My only friend in high school was my piano teacher, and then he got that boyfriend with the Trans Am, and I never saw him again.

I really wish I could travel back in time and give young you a hug.

Yeah, well young me would've greeted that hug with an immediate collapse in orgasm.

Oh.

But you know what, maybe you're right.

If we want to be the place where friends gather... maybe we got to chill.

Yeah, because we... we want to be the hub.

You know?

Ooh, we'd make such a good hub.

Yes, we would.

Make such a good... we'd make such a good hub.

Are you having an orgasm right now?

Are you kidding me?

Hey.

Hey.

Winston Bishop, nice to meet you.

What are we doing right now?

I'm practicing introducing myself to Aly's parents.

Oh, I got you.

You're a little nervous. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.

You know, I want to make a good first impression.

Oh, that makes sense.

How's my shake?

Nope. No, no, no, no, no.

Do not go in with two hands.

Also, why are your hands so wet?

Damn, for me that's dry.

They're dripping.

How's this for Aly's mom?

I'm Aly's mom?

Okay.

Mm-mm.

(smooches) Not today, honey.

Yeah, all wrong.

We bring it in for the real thing.

All wrong.

All wrong.

Okay.

That was very aggressive.

You inv*de my space. I didn't feel safe.

Just be more normal about it. Like this.

Hey, how are you? I'm Winston. Nice to meet you.

Oh, like...

Hey, how are you? I'm Winston.

Zip, a pleasure, uh, to do it.

See, all of that, cut that out.

Okay.

Hi, how are you? I'm Aly's mother.

(smooches)

You do... you do well. (chuckles)

You do well to-to be friends with me.

Hmm?

Winston, shake it out.

(laughs) I'm nervous, dude.

I know you are.

Look, they're gonna love you.

Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna mill about.

I'm gonna talk you up. I'm gonna tell your stories.

Yes. Use one of my good ones, the ones that make me look awesome.

(chuckles) Like the time I fell asleep in the bathtub.

But all that one is is that you fell asleep in a bathtub.

The end. End of story.

That's amazing.

I think we can come up with better ones, don't you?

No, that's a home run for sure, because I woke up wet.

Now I see.

And also, it's all about how you tell it.

Right.

I trust you. You're the writer.

I am, and that was the gift I was given.

Put her there.

You got it.

What is going on with these hands?

What?

A second ago, they were dripping wet, and now they are piping hot.

("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)

Leslie!

Winston!

I h*t your car when I parked. Sorry.

Yeah, I... I didn't drive here.

Oh, well, that's a relief.

Anyway, uh, your sister is on her way. Where are your parents?

Oh, my dad doesn't take highways for political reasons.

But everyone else is here.

Cool.

Come on in. (laughs)

Hey.

Hi there.

Hey there.

Hey.

Thank you.

Wow.

How big is your family? (chuckles)

Oh, my gosh. Hey.

How many cars did you guys take?

Hey, make yourselves at home. Everybody come on in.

Did you guys rent a bus?

Just breathe. Just breathe.

Hey. Hey now.

Schmidt: Winston, Winston.

Winston. A-a word, please.

Huh? Yeah, coming.

Hey.

Hey, man, you look familiar.

Did I pull you over last week?

Why so many?

Cece (quietly): There are 30 people out there.

(bl*ws nose)

Schmidt: We do not have enough china!

Or forks or prawns.

You can't ask somebody to split a prawn.

Babe, I know, all right? But you just need to relax.

We will be fine.

(glass breaks)

We can adjust.

Man: Sorry.

Just remember, we're chill.

No, you're right. We are totally chill.

We'll just break out the backup china!

I'll just come in tomorrow morning with a power washer, and hose this whole frickin' place down.

("La Cucaracha" doorbell plays)

There's Lefty.

By the way, there is no backup china!

I know, I know, all right.

(crowd quiets)

Keep them closed.

Aly: All right, last time you did this, you revealed Furguson in a tuxedo.

(laughs) This is even better.

Say hello to... your entire family!

All: Surprise!

(whispers): What the hell is this?

(quietly): So, do the cute, surprised look you do.

Nah, that's not it. That's not the one.

Remember? When you...

Oh.

You're pissed.

We're lost.

Why did you let me chase a waterfall?

You know what TLC says.

I'm sorry. Just...

I'm really hungry.

Here.

You can have some of my trail mix.

That's just a bag of raisins.

Well, that's because I only like to eat the peanuts and the chocolate.

Well, I only like the chocolate and the peanuts, too!

Why do we even add raisins?!

I don't know!

All right, look, you know what, we're lost and... it's gonna get dark soon, so let's... just head back.

Fine. Did you pack a flashlight?

Robby, did you pack a flashlight?

No.

Then there's your answer.

You know what, it's fine, okay?

We know that we have to go downhill, so just follow me.

I'll lead, okay?

Ah! God! Oh!

Oh! Robby!

Oh!

Oh, my God!

I lost my glasses.

Are you okay?

Oh.

Please tell me those were crunchy leaves.

Let me see.

Oh, I think that's them.

Hold on. Oh! Jess!

Ah!

Ah! Ow, my ankle!

My beautiful dancer's ankle!

Hey. What's the matter?

You know, I got all your family together in one room.

You know, you're being greeted by all the people that you love.

I know.

Well, except for your parents, but they will be here soon, barring any surface street traffic.

That is so sweet, Winston.

And I do love my family, but they're crazy.

And, honestly, they make me a little crazy.

Every family is crazy.

Every time we get together, it's a disaster.

Like a giant hot air balloon catching on f*re.

Here's the difference: you got backup now.

Have I ever let you down as a partner?

Except for that mixed doubles tournament.

Got it!

We don't got to talk about that. We ain't got to go back there.

My point is this: we're a team.

Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Maybe this time will be different.

Right?

Yeah.

But you really need to know the lay of the land.

Okay, let me take notes.

So, my sister is... my sister.

Mm-hmm.

Uncle Bill is a real weather nerd.

Super annoying.

Right, right, right.

Aunt Karen keeps a free-floating piece of floss in her purse.

She will use it tonight.

It's revolting.

Okay.

Do me a favor. Hold on.

Repeat everything you just said.

My thumbprint won't let me in.

Okay, uh, my sister is... you met her...

Ah, wait, yeah, no, no, still not in.

Let me get... wipe my hand off right there.

Now we're cooking with gas. (chuckles)

My sister... okay.

No, we ain't.

Winston, he's a great guy.

Mm-hmm.

He and I go way back.

Tons of stories, tons of... tons of stories.

Really? All right.

Right now?

Yeah.

One time he was taking a bath and he fell asleep.

(wheezing laugh)

You believe this guy? What a nut.

Life of the party, this guy.

He fell asleep in a bath? That's the story?

That's the story? No.

That's the start of the story.

We are out of appetizers.

They stripped this tray of shrimp like piranhas.

They didn't even leave tails.

I think someone took a shower in the bathroom.

We don't have towels or soap.

I don't know how they did it.

We need to re-examine this whole no rules thing.

It's a freaking circus in here.

What are we gonna feed these people in the meantime?

In about ten minutes, they're gonna start eating the drywall.

I think there was a...

(plate clanks loudly)

(chuckles) Thank you.

Thank you.

I think there was a bag of rice in the house when we bought it.

I thought that was barley.

It was really dirty.

Okay, fine, whatever. Boil it up!

Robby: Okay, well, it's really dark and uneven, but at least we found the trail.

Yeah, I mean, it's like a night hike. (chuckles)

Maybe we'll see a colony of bats. (chuckles)

It's kind of like a waterfall.

But with monsters, in the sky.

(thunder cracks)

Oh! Oh, man.

Okay, uh, Jess, it's raining.

Jess: Let's take shelter in that cave!

What if it's more of a nest than a cave?

Whatever. It'll do.

Sister!

(both squealing)

(chuckles)

Winston: Oh, that's some sisterly love right there.

Let me get you two a drink.

Okay.

(squeals)

Oh, my God, Winston is so good for you.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

And I saw with my own eyes one day when Winston saved those kids from a burning building, including a little boy.

A little boy who's dad left when he was young.

Named Wheelchair Timmy.

Wheelchair Timmy was a heavyset boy, ginger.

Black eyes.

So what, you think I'm just some cold robot who needs some guy to loosen me up, make me happy?

I just said Winston's good for you.

Oh, my God, you always get like this!

He grabs the kid and the chair, lifts him up above his head, so that the f*re doesn't burn this little heavyset boy.

That's the power of adrenaline.

And what happened to Timmy?

Timmy? He's d*ad.

What?

He's alive. I'm Timmy.

Look at me now.

Because of Winston, I'm telling you this story.

No, you said your name was Nick.

I am Nick. I got to go!

How should I be, huh? Like you?

(mocking): "Oh, my God, look at me, I'm Leslie. I wear holiday socks in the summer. I follow Ariana Grande around like she was the Grateful d*ad."

(mocking): "Oh, I'm Aly. I went to Quantico and I got a disease, and I can't be around people!"

Do you mean "quarantine"?

Whatever!

You're so mean!

You're being a mean robot!

No, this is being a mean robot.

(robotic voice): "Beep, boop, boop, boop. Leslie, you suck. You can't pull off bangs. You were an accident."

Leslie: Oh, my God! I have a small forehead, and you know that, and you use that against me!

Just shut up!

I hate you!

I hate you! I...

(Leslie sobs)

(whispers): God.

(sighs) Oh, no.

The wheelchair boy, Timmy, speaks very highly of you.

(chuckles)


You're Aunt Karen?

Mm-hmm.

You didn't make a lot of sense.

(grunts)

Yeah, it's really coming down out there.

It's really freezing.

Yeah.

(thunder rumbling softly)

Hey, Robby?

Do you ever think it's, like... it's not good that we're so similar?

Oh, I don't know.

You know, my Great Uncle Shep Wallingford used to say "You buy the horse that you see in the mirror."

Did you say "Wallingford"?

Mm-hmm.

I have Wallingfords in my family, out near Boston.

Ah, mine are in, uh, Newburyport.

They were kind of, like, local celebrities.

They were well-known for making... women's watches.

... Women's watches.

How'd you know that?

♪ Wallingford watches ♪

Both: ♪ 'Cause the time is now ♪
♪ And the look is wow! ♪

(chuckles)

Robby...

I think we're related.

(thunder rumbles)

(Jess and Robby screaming)

(Jess and Robby screaming)

Do you have an Uncle Tony?

Tony, with the long fingernails, and he always wears a whistle around his neck.

Robby, we are third cousins.

Oh, my God!

Ah!

Why, God?!

We're going to hell!

(groans)

We did stuff.

No, stop!

Just saying.

I can't live in this reality!

At least not second cousins.

Ah, I can't.

First cousins would be way worse.

Please, no.

People do it all the time, in the, in the mountains.

In the mountains.

(retches)

Don't be startled.

God!

What are you doing in here, Cece?

I am hiding, okay?

That party is out of control.

Some guy almost b*rned his eyebrows off trying to light a cigarette on our stove.

It's complete anarchy in there.

Can we just hide in here and hang out together?

We haven't christened the garage yet.

Ooh, you make a very good point.

Okay.

Winston: Hey.

Hello, Winston.

Hey.

Question: have you guys seen Aly?

(sighs)

What's going on, man?

She ran off. If I'd known it was gonna be like this, I would've just done the trench coat thing.

The... what?

What is the trench coat thing?

It's where I pick her up from the airport naked, wearing nothing but a trench coat.

Have you guys seen a kid in a wheelchair?

That was me.

What?

Whoa!

Wow.

Nick, what are you doing in here?

Look, I was having a hard time with your stories, so I took a little poetic license.

People started asking some questions.

Things got ahead of me.

And I had no choice but to hide in the car.

Nick, I thought you were gonna stick to the tub story.

It's not a story, Winston. It's not a story!

A story about sleeping...

It's mental.

It's really not...

Hey.

Found her.

Yeah.

Hey, are you guys ever not together?

Rarely.

You know what? Hold on one second.

I want to talk to you. Guys, can you give us a minute?

Sure, Winston. Cece, let's go hide in the car... in the garage of our home.

Yeah, okay.

We'll give you guys a minute.

Aly, uh, I was just trying to be sweet and...

And I ruined it. I know.

I said my family was crazy, and I ended up being the craziest one.

Look, I'm so embarrassed you saw that side of me, and I'm sure you want to run for the hills.

So, it's fine. I don't blame you.

You're embarrassed of being crazy in front of me?

I acted insane.

Even just talking about it is humiliating.

I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna walk away.

Okay.

Oh, dear Lord.

The car's running.

Nick, how long have you been in here?

Been running this whole time?

I was cold. I was cold.

Did you ever go to one of those big Wallingford family cookouts?

Just one, in '92.

I remember they had a really competitive three-legged race, and they paired me up with a little boy who had a helmet on.

His skin was so translucent, it was like he was a jellyfish.

Did he play an imaginary trombone?

Yeah.

He kept saying, "It's better to be safe than speedy."

That was me! That was me!

Oh, my God.

Oh, this is too much.

I don't want to die with my cousin-lover in a cave.

Oh, God.

Everyone will think we fled here 'cause society wouldn't accept us.

I just wanted to see a waterfall.

Me, too! I got to get out of here!

You can't walk, I can't see anything.

Stand up, blind boy. I'm getting on your back.

Take these.

Oh, okay.

Oh, man. Okay.

We have the same prescription.

Yeah, no kidding, Robby. All right, you ready?

Yeah. So, "Wallingfords" on three?

No! Ew!

I'm really sorry. I'm so nervous.

Okay, one, two, three!

Two, three!

(both yelling)

Robby: I didn't wear the right shoes for this!

Jess: Go over there!

I'm sorry about before.

I guess I really freaked out on you.

And I'm sorry that I told you I was gonna shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.

You never said that.

Oh, maybe I was just thinking that.

I'm just so embarrassed Winston saw that.

I'm pretty sure I scared him off.

No, you didn't. He's on the table.

(tapping glass)

Oh, no.

Oh, no, no, no.

Winston: Hello.

I am Winston Bishop.

I'm Aly's boyfriend.

Please, if you will, I want to, uh, say a few words to my girlfriend.

He's standing on the furniture.

Just relax, okay? Help is on the way.

Aly, I wanted you to feel special tonight because... I'm wild about you.

Maybe things didn't go perfectly, but damn it, don't be embarrassed to be crazy in front of me.

Okay? I am the king of crazy.

(chuckles)

I have inside jokes with my cat.

I am a member of the Puzzling Guild of North America.

I shave my face cold, and I brush my teeth hot.

It's true.

On one very late and very desperate night, I used Furguson's cat box as my own box.

And, yes, it is true what many of you have heard.

I once fell asleep in a bathtub!

(laughing)

I love that story.

(continues laughing)

And then what happened?

What do you mean, "And then what happened?"

He fell asleep in the tub!

He was asleep, and then he woke up.

(stomping on table)

I don't know, maybe I got to hear it again.

So who cares if you're crazy?

I don't care. I'm crazy, too.

(scoffs) Watch this.

I'm gonna put a carrot behind my ear, like a bunny reporter, and I'm gonna do this dance I've been working on for five years.

(grunting rhythmically)

Don't you do that carrot.

Little bunny carrot.

(imitates chewing)

(Winston mumbling goofy noises)

(laughs)

I see we got two new... people here.

Who are they?

Yeah, um, Mom, Dad, this is Winston.

Hey.

(chuckles)

Uh... I am Winston.

And I assure you that all of those incidents were from a very long time ago, kinda.

It's clear you love our daughter.

In a very passionate, unique way.

That's all that matters.

(chuckles)

(mouthing)

You're a two-hander, huh?

(laughs)

Well, all right.

Okay.

Yes.

Okay.

Okay.

Seriously, we've been on the road for a couple of hours.

We need to use the bathroom.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course!

It's, uh, right down, right down the hall.

(chuckles)

Thank you for not being afraid of me or my family.

(knocking)

Open up. Police!

Who-who called the police?

I don't know.

I guess we better do whatever they say. Ugh.

Why are you guys acting like you're in a p*rn?

(sighs)

We got a noise complaint.

The law has spoken, everyone.

I guess the party's over.

You could just file out through here.

Winston?

(chuckles): Look who it is.

Hey, Aly, you're back.

Jenkins, get in here, man! We having a party.

What you drinking?

Hi, Jenkins.

Wait, what?

(laughs)

Well, you know what, I guess I'm just gonna have to take the law into my own hands.

All right, everybody!

Shoes off, coasters down!

This is our house, and our house has rules! Okay?

Not a suggestion. Shoes off, let's go!

Okay, okay. Shoes off.

Shoes.

Schmidt: Take your shoes off...

Get 'em off!

... and put 'em to the side!

Yep!

And then let's have a good time.

Yeah, let's have some fun.

It's a party, people.

It's a party.

Robby: So just to be clear, um, we're definitely broken up, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, I mean, that's...

Yeah. I mean...

I don't know why I asked.

Well...

Oh, wait. You should take these.

Oh, you know, keep 'em. They look great on you.

Thank you.

I'll see you around.

Yeah.

Maybe at the next family reun...

Too soon. Yep.

A little too soon. Yes.

Oh, dear Lord.

It's not as bad as it looks.

I'm really, I'm really clean underneath all this mud.

Oh, my God, what happened?

(sighs) Hike took a turn, and then Robby and I broke up in a cave.

I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I am so sorry.

Air hug.

Yeah.

I'm gonna go get you a glass of wine.

Real sorry about you and Robby. Don't touch anything.

I'm gonna go get some paper towels. Don't-don't move.

Whoa, Jess! Are you okay?

Oh, long story.

But I'm okay. Is there any food left?

I'm so hungry, and all I have is this bag of gross raisins.

Gross raisins? Are you kidding me?

Raisins are the best. I love raisins.

(laughs): Of course you do.

Yeah, sometimes I just tuck 'em in my cheek, and I go about my day, so if I ever need the flavor of raisins, well, I already got it.

I'm having trouble envisioning what it's like to need the flavor of raisins.

But go nuts.

Go raisins. (laughs)

You said, "Go nuts," I said, "Go raisins."

Cece: Wine.

Paper towels.

Jess: Oh, thank you, Schmidt.

Thanks. Oh, thanks.

Thanks. Thank you.

Schmidt: Just step on these.

Nick: Go faster.

Jess: Uh, I have enough paper towels.

Winston: Hey!

Jess: Hey!

Hey, what's up?

Not much.

Welcome to the party.

Thanks.

Where's Robby?

Jess: Oh, yeah, um, he couldn't make it.

Turns out we're cousins, so...

Nick: What?!

Cece: What?

Nick: He's your cousin?

Jess: House looks great.

Nick: Wait a second.

Thank you.

What?

How did that happen?

Nick: Cousin?





Commentator: They've scored five touchdowns in this game...

Wow. Check this out.

Coach and May's foreign exchange student just added me as a friend.

Montsie. His name is Montsie.

I didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.

I didn't know they moved to North Carolina.

Neither did I.

(they laugh)

They moved to North Carol... what?

Yeah.

How did none of us know about this? How is that possible?

Eh, they moved. It happened.

We need to make more of an effort.

We don't even know that our friend has moved to a different state.

I mean, we're still friends.

We just have nothing to do with each other.

This doesn't bother you?

Realistically, we'll probably see 'em two or three more times before we die.

And it's sad, but it's also not that sad.

What?

Who cares? What's for dinner?

I care.

McKenna, please. Please, don't do this. Okay? I mean, what about that formal swimwear ad I got you? McKenna?

McKen...?

Well, guys! It happened again.

A big agency stole another one of my clients.

And I have a big audition today.

Gosh darn it. You know what?

Cece: Jess!

Those pretty boys don't deserve you.

Which one is McKenna? Is he the gaunt, heroin-hot one?

That's Jean Francois. He got poached last week.

McKenna's the one that looked like a jacked Bryant Gumbel.

Oh...

And this is a huge deal!

It's the Sausage Crunchies account!

Why would a dog food company be interested in a bunch of hot models?

Oh, no, it's, uh...

Nick: No, no, no.

Sausage Crunchies are people food.

They're like brown cheese snacks.

Yeah, it's like space food. I-I put them in soup.

Cece: I just really wanted to show this casting agency that I was legit.

Now, if I go down there with just Donovan, I'm gonna look like a no-name hustler.

Gosh darn it.

Should I go out now, and try to find new clients, or should I concentrate on the one client that I have left?

You know, they're probably sniffing around Donovan as we speak.

(gasps) Crap.

Is that what he wants to talk to me about?

He said he wanted to talk to me about something.

Is that what he wanted to talk to me about?

These poachers.

Cece... Cece, calm.

You concentrate on Donovan.

I'll go see if I can drum up some new clients.

Very sweet, but the audition is in six hours from now.

So we have no time to look for new clients.

Well, recruiting is just like sales, I mean selling a job is just like selling drugs. I do that every day.

Are you offering to help, too?

Honestly, I wasn't.

But based on how intensely you're staring at me, I guess I've boxed myself into a corner here, so...

Great! Okay. You concentrate on Donovan.

We'll get the models. Heads in, guys.

What?

"Heads in"?

No. It's "hands in."

I'm pretty sure it's "heads in."

What are we supposed to do? Smoosh our heads together?

Yeah.

Everybody. Hands in.

Hands in.

Hands in.

Winston: Meow.

Schmidt: Winston!

What?

How are you not tired of this?

Tired of what?

♪ ♪

Okay, model types, 3:00.

Take a bow.

Wait, those two oatmeal men?

Follow my lead.

How did we ever date the same dude?

(laughs): Hey!

Kampai. That's Japanese for "What's up?"

Hi! Jessica Day.

What are we celebrating?

Kirby here works for a marine biologist. and he got them to name a new species of sea slug after me.

Oh!

It's called Bruce's Eastern Sea Slug.

You two are fascinating.

Have you ever considered modeling?

Kirby: I actually have. A-a lot.

Us?

I have a rich fantasy life.

Oh.

I can't wait to hear more about that.

Sounds so great.

What are you doing?

Those guys are obviously not model material.

Because they're not cookie-cutter hot?

Cece needs a bunch of different guys, so don't judge a book by its cover.

Except when you're talking about models.

Models exist to be on covers.

I think that's an oversimplification.

I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.

Something, something that makes them stand apart.

Like a gap in their lower teeth, or a neck nipple.

You're making this way too complicated.

Look, this is all it needs to be... you walk up to a hot guy, okay?

And you say "Hey, you're hot.

"Do you want to be a model?"

You have to forge a connection with them.

And that way they entrust us with the thing that makes them really beautiful.

You know what? You do your thing.

I'll do my thing.

But your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.

Sea slugs, Reagan.

They're sea slug guys.

But you're right.

You're nasty about it, but you're right.

Cece: So, Donovan, you have something you want to tell me?

(inhales, exhales)

I've... made a big decision.

No, Donovan, don't.

I'm gonna stop wearing beanies.

Wait, what?

I think. I...

That's what you wanted to talk to me about?

I thought some big agency was trying to poach you.

No. (chuckles)

They've just been sending me baskets and trying to take me to fancy dinners and stuff.

What?

They've just been giving me baskets and trying...

Listen to me, okay?

I know that gift baskets are great.

Yeah.

They are.

But once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.

Because they don't care about you.

All they care about are numbers.

But you, Donovan, you are my first priority.

So when you're with me, you will never feel neglected.

Just tell me what you need. I got you.

I need someone to help me get better at tricks on my motorcycle.

Sure.

(grunts) Mmm.

I really hate these things. I just can't stop eating 'em.

I got to say, the taste is average, but the aftertaste is outstanding.

What happens when I'm just an outstanding aftertaste?

Hmm?

When I move out, are you guys gonna forget about me like Coach?

This loft is what tethers us together.

And once it's gone, we're gonna be spread across the Earth like Rod Stewart's offspring.

What I'm gonna miss most about you is all this poetry.

No, no, no. You know what, do not give up on us already.

We just need to find something that keeps us together.

Like a dark secret or a time-share.

You know, it was easier when men went to w*r.

You'd forge an unbreakable bond in a crucible of blood and pain.

You can't get that splitting the cost of toilet paper.

We just need to come up with some sort of ritual.

Yes! Now you're thinking.

We stand in a circle, right?

We burn chicken bones, all right?

Dear Lord, Winston.

Then we're just secretive about it.

This is the wrong ritual...

I'm just saying no one knows about it.

I didn't literally mean a ritual.

Oh.

I just mean, like, a shared experience, one that bonds us together.

I've been saying this for the longest time, but I'm really ready to get super weird into metal detectors if you guys are.

That's, sure, that's one idea.

You can look for treasure.

Nickels, dimes, quarters.

If you find enough, um, said treasure or change, supplement your income.

It's also entertaining.

While looking, there's, uh, an endorphin rush.

It's entertainment, it's income... uh, ritual.

Why don't we get tracksuits and play chess at the park?

I already got a chess crew.

♪ ♪

You do that right outside of the loft?

Yeah, right outside the loft.

How have I never seen you once?

'Cause you don't go outside of the loft.

That's just not true.

Fellas, fellas, fellas, I got it.

Yeah? Metal detectors?

That's a super cool idea, man.

I appreciate the idea. I want to hear more about it.

I feel like I'm being teased.

Let me guess, you guys are pre-gaming before your high school reunion.

You were nerds, but you grew up to be super handsome.

You were cool but approachable.

Maybe you were rollerbladers...

Okay. Here's the deal.

You're all models now, and that's your new manager.

H-hold on a sec. There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.

Oh. (laughs)

You think we're trying to pick you up, because we're at a bar and we're telling you how handsome you are.

Excuse me.

You're hot, and you're about to make the easiest decision of your life.

Not interested.

♪ He's a brown-eyed handsome man ♪

Don't tell me. Only child, right?

I guess now I am.

As of yesterday.

Sorry, did you... did you...

It's loud. Did you hear what I, I said?

I said you were hot.

Um, have you ever thought about modeling?

Lady, you can't treat me like a piece of meat.

Now, I know I'm hot, but I don't need your validation.

We're trying to have a serious conversation here about why the bees have disappeared.

♪ He h*t a high fly into the stands ♪

If a couple of guys in a bar can't figure it out, who will?

So, how'd you do?

Got a couple irons in the f*re, so...

Me, too, me, too. Planted a couple seeds, just waiting for the harvest.

Hey! Hey, you.

Stop what you're doing right now.

What? I'm sorry.

That's just how I walk.

If I don't swing my arms, I start thinking I'm standing, and I'll fall.

Oh... (chuckles)

Tell me, do you have any modeling experience?

I was trapped in a window display in a department store once, and I was on the news a lot.

Are we talking local or national news?

Oh, that's a good question.

Um...

I think... sorry... what my friend is trying to say is that it sounds like you have on-camera experience, and if you would like, we can hook you up with a top talent manager who could get you an audition today.

I do like hooking my thumb into my belt loops, and pulling my pants down...

Yeah. No. Don't do it now.

But it is called "The Cowboy."

And I can see it's not your first rodeo.

Okay. Uh, your new manager's name is Cece.

Go to that address.

Thanks. Okay.

No, don't say it.

We're a team.

No.

I'm the bait, you're the hook.

I don't think the bait usually thinks of the hook as its teammate.

That's such a hook thing to say.

You're such a hook.

You know...

I've always wanted to have a boys spa day.

Nick, did you wear your shirt during the massage?

I did, but no bottoms.

It was liberating.

Good for you.

Check this out. These cucumbers are gratis.

(laughs) I'm gonna make some pickles.

If you're impressed by a couple of free cucumbers, get ready to have your blind bl*wn, 'cause I signed us up for the elite package.

Does that mean the pickle's already pickled?

Gentlemen, eucalyptus towels?

Thank you.

Oh, yeah... uh, mine's already wet!

No, no, no, it's for smelling, not drying.

Oh.

Put it up to your face, smell it.

Mmm. How could a smell be both hot and cold at the same time, I ask.

It's nice.

Ooh, this place is dope.

Man, I feel very Roman.

Boys, I think we found our ritual.

(laughing) Yeah, we did.

If you gentlemen are ready, I can take you to your Brazilians.

(laughs) Sounds very fun.

I'm in a relationship, myself.

Yeah.

Uh, but I would love to look.

Just point me to the door, please.

Sir. The elite package at S'Pa includes the wax removal of hair from your nether regions.

What did you say, homeboy?

Scrotum wax.

No, Schmidt.

Say something.

Say something to him.

Cece: Donovan.

I have some very good news.

I have a brand-new client that I am very excited for you to meet.

I'm Dean and I'm a model.

Mm-hmm.

But I'm a model.

No. I'm a model.

Yeah, both models.

No. I'm a model.

No. I-I am a model.

I am... I'm the model.

But, like, I'm, but I model.

I'm a model.

I model.

You...

I'm a model.

I just told... I'm a model.

Astro Fuel.

I model.

What the heck is going on?

Well, Cece's Boys is growing, so I'm just gonna help Dean make a résumé for the big audition we're all gonna go on.

What about my résumé?

You already have a résumé.

Well, I-I-I want another one.

And another sandwich.

I want a sandwich, too.

Stop copying me!

Donovan. Dean.

Reagan: Um...

Hmm.

(indistinct chatter)

No...

The line between what we're doing and being creepy is so thin.

(cell phone rings)

Hey, Cece, what's up?

Any luck? The audition's in an hour, I'm getting kind of panicky.

Yeah. Totally. Um... we're just looking for that perfect Cece's Boys type, you know... perfect.

Ow!

I don't know hair this short can get so tangled!

Okay?

You're hurting me.

I'm very sorry.

Donovan: Cece, I don't know how many buttons to do on my shirt.

Donovan, please.

Look, Jess.

If you haven't found anyone by now, maybe I should just cut my losses.

Maybe I should just tell them I only...

No, no, no, no, no. We actually, um...

(clears throat) we have two guys, we'll...

You do? Oh!

... bring them right over.

You are the best. Thank you!

I'm sorry?

I'm gonna be honest.

I don't know what I'm looking for.

Oh, it-it's the other one.

No.

They have a real look.

What look would that be?

I own my own dog-walking company?

Branding!

You're good.

You know what? I believe in them.

And we also have no other choice.

So let's get them camera-ready.

How far away is that camera gonna be?

(laughs)

Okay, guys, let's go... Oh, hey, Kirby.

Looking good.

That is for cats.

But it's okay. Put this on.

They're from my roommate's earthquake kit.

He has a three-week supply.

Bruce. Put this on. They won't recognize you on your next volunteer shift at the hospital.

Ah. Jess.

Hallway.

Okay, are you absolutely sure that this is the way to go?

Can't we get our hands on, like, a water polo team?

Or hire escorts?

Or call in a b*mb thr*at to the audition.

In this political environment?

Oh, I'm nervous even saying it.

What about nothing?

No!

Is nothing maybe the right thing to do in this situation?

We can't bail on Cece. This is her sh*t.

We can't let her become irrelevant like chunky belts, or quoting Borat.

Okay. Well, if I have to go down with the ship, I'm not going down without a fight.

And those two are gonna need a lot more than hair gel and V-necks.

They're gonna need motorcycle boots, scarves, knit caps, and all the eye makeup that Schmidt's got.

Dean (muffled): Cece?

Hello?

Cece?

(muttering)

What are you doing in here?

Donovan told me to wait here in your break room and then he left.

What?!

And I couldn't open the door and it was really dark.

Donovan, get in here right now!

Donovan, we have an audition in an hour and you lock Dean in a closet?

Well, you said I was your number one client.

Okay. No. Wait, Donovan.

I'm out of here.

Just calm down. Wait.

I went the wrong way. Don't look.

(whispering): So, what are we thinking?

I don't know. Maybe they give you something to bite down on.

No, I'm talking about leaving!

You're being so dramatic right now.

I don't think I'm being dramatic.

Look, I'll say it now without any drama.

I don't want the hairs ripped off my testicles by a stranger.

I think they're there for a reason.

They are trained professionals in there.

This isn't gonna be some back-alley sack waxing.

They have those?

I'm sure they do, but this isn't one of them.

Who would go to that one?

(sputters) Well, sometimes, in an emergency, you got to do what you got to do.

What would the emergency ever be?

Nick, this is gonna be like cottage cheese all over again.

At first, you're gonna be kicking and screaming, saying that you don't want to try it, but I'm telling you, in the end, you're gonna tell everybody that you meet how much you loved it.

This is nothing like cottage cheese.

Exactly like cottage cheese.

Guys, I have off-the-charts follicle strength, okay?

It'll be a blood bath down there, a real crime scene, so I'm leaning, "No."

I'm out! Like my mother says at every party she goes to, "No one touches my purse."

Good day.

Wait. Sit. Sit down.

You guys don't need to leave.

Just a minute ago, you were saying how much you love this place.

Just don't get your sack waxed.

Okay, I don't care how big the park is.

If there is a loose bear in it, I'm not going in the park!

I'm never going in that park again!

I'm never going in again!

But this is our ritual!

Schmidt, we'll just find a new one.

Easy for you to say.

You two guys are still gonna be living together in the loft, saying, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

"I didn't know you were in here in the bathroom."

And coming up with clever names for the Wi-Fi network like, "This Is 4D."

That's pretty good.

I'd say we just... let's agree right now to switch it to that.

Points is, is your lives are going to go on, and I'll just always be that weirdo you once lived with.

So you know what?

I am gonna get my sack waxed.

So enjoy the rest of your lives together.

I'm gonna go shuck this corn.

Oh, man.

Hey, do you think they'll take a picture of him just as they rip like they do on roller coasters?

I think you missed the point of what just happened.

(laughing)

Did you just see that?

No. I had my eyes closed.

I was saying a non-denominational prayer for Bruce and Kirby. What did I miss?

That woman just checked out our guys.

Like, she-she really checked them out.

Maybe we have a chance. I don't know.

Did you hear what you just said?

What?

You said, "Our guys."

Okay, let's just go in.

Our guys!

Don't get sentimental.

Our guys.

Oh, you get off of me.

Our guys!

(indistinct chatter)

Jess, I asked for models, not a couple of driver's ed instructors!

I know, Cece, but they're hot on the inside.

Bruce teaches CPR to children with irregular mouths, and Kirby has given so much bone marrow, they told him to stop.

I don't know how that's gonna help them at a print ad audition.

You're right, she's right.

I don't know what we were thinking.

Let's go put these dogs down.

Why did we even give them names?

They came with names.

Right, I guess what I meant is why did we bothering learning them.

Guys, uh, there's been a little hiccup.

We're allowed to eat all these, right?

I just love them.

Yeah, you guys can keep eating. Um, so, there's no way to sugarcoat this, but the truth is...

(shushing)

Wait, wait, wait...

So gross, right?

Ooh, nasty!

(shushing) Cece? Cece, come here.

What?

Look around this room.

Nobody's eating these things but them.

Oh, my God, yes!

And they love them.

It almost makes me want to try them.

And I emphasize "almost."

They're making a mistake.

These are the guys that can sell this stuff.

Not these guys.

But they've already decided on the direction of the ad.

So tell them to change it!

I mean, what have you got to lose?

Hey, Joy.

I'm scared.

Nick: Don't you be scared, kid!

Nick?

We're here with you, buddy!

Winston!

Nick: We don't need a ritual, Schmidt, 'cause you're not gonna lose us.

I thought we could've just told you that, but Winston thought we needed to show it.

Yeah, I thought that would be better.

You know, it makes more sense to me.

Band of brothers.

Band of brothers!

That's right, man. Band of brothers, bro.

Band of brothers.

You know, I've been a little bit curious about it this whole time.

I just couldn't admit it to you guys, you know?

I think this would be more dignified if we did it in silence.

Schmidt: Of course.

Yeah, let's do this in silence.

Good luck, guys.

I'm ready for you, lady.

Three friends going on the same silent journey, together, yet separate, alone, yet closer than ever.

(screaming)

Nick?

I'm all right!

(paper ripping, Winston screaming)

Schmidt: Winston?

Can you hear me, Schmidt?!

You hang in there, you son of a... (screaming)

Aah! This woman's ripping it off!

(shrieking)

Ooh! That's actually kind of warm. Ouch!

No! Okay, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out!

(paper rips)

(slowed-down, distorted speech)

(screaming)

(slowed-down yelling)

(slow-motion, distorted): No, no, no! No!

(yelling, ripping sound)

(yelling)

(ripping sound)

(distorted yelling)

(distorted groaning)

(distorted yelling)

(distorted): Oh!

(yelling and howling)

How many times do you freakin' do it?!

Okay, good. You both are here.

So, guess who got the Sausage Crunchies job.

(gasps) Oh, yay, Kirby!

Hey, Kirby!

Not Kirby, but I am going to hang on to him.

I think he could book ads for both fast food and anti-depressants.

Ah.

Bruce?

They absolutely hated Bruce.

He got sick during the audition.

Sausage Crunchies everywhere.

That's a lot.

But they loved Dean!

Mm. (laughs)

Oh, it's nice to see the good guys win.

Right?! They said I brought them the best and the worst of the day, so... maybe that's my thing.

Hmm.

Can I throw out this, uh, soggy bag of cucumbers?

Winston: No!

Those are pickles in progress.

(groaning)

Um, I don't mean to be mean, but you guys are being real babies about this whole thing.

(laughs) They don't...

Until you've had your sack waxed, you can't know this pain.

Excuse me?

Childbirth?

Weekly wax, top to tail.

We went through hell, and we came out the other side, gentlemen.

It was w*r.

Granted, one that took place in a high end-spa, but still our w*r.

(laughs)

That's right.

I mean, this not something we do every week, right?

No, it's like a monthly thing.

Monthly?

Not a chance!

It's our ritual.

No. No, no, no, no. One time only.

Guys, how can it be a ritual if we only do it one time?

Shut up, Schmidt! I will never go back!

(Winston crying)

Nick: It's okay, man. We're gonna get metal detectors.





To Cece, for booking her first client's first modeling gig.

All: Hey!

Robby: Cheers.

And to Winston for making Donovan the face of LAPD's recruitment campaign.

I just hope he doesn't look better in blue than I do.

Wink.

Oh, he definitely will. He's a model.

(clears throat) So in honor of this occasion, we all got you gifts for your home office.

You may know it by its former name, the dining room table.

Me first. A cubicle, swinging b*lls, Mm. an outgoing mailbox, a cartoon that is very derogatory towards Mondays.

So thoughtful, babe.

Will that mailbox be functional?

If it wasn't, it would just be a box, wouldn't it?

So can I buy a stamp for this letter?

It's not a post office, man.

Who else has a gift?

Whoo! Bull button.

You press that, guaranteed crowd pleaser.

Button: Bull!

Ooh!

(laughter)

I got something better.

Noise-canceling headphones.

Thank you. Wow.

Yeah, are those mine?

Yes.

They're broken.

Oh, nothing is ever truly broken.

All right, well, I got you a filing cabinet to file all the headshots of your clients.

FYI, Ferguson's in one of those drawers making fluffies.

"Fluffies" is cat farts.

Bull!

(laughter)

♪ ♪

Do you have a stamp for this letter?

Is that a bill from when you were in the hospital?

Oh, this? Yeah, it is.

Turns out they, uh, they charge for new knees.

(Robby chuckles, Jess scoffs)

I feel so bad.

I should pay that.

What? Why?

Seriously?

(yelling and grunting)

(cr*ck, Robby yelling)

Oh my God, your bad knee! Oh, my God!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

But wait a second, why do you want to pay?

I turned your knee into a bag of marbles.

I should pay your medical bill.

This is my only bill, and it's just a baby bill.

You know, it's so small and cute, like my nephew Baby Bill.

Give me that baby.

I feel bad, but okay.

Wait, how did you...

(gasps)

I studied pickpocketing when I played the Artful Dodger in my college production of Oliver!

Oh, wow, that's so cool.

Oh, wait, so did I.

What...

Ow, Winston, straighten your arms when you eat.

You don't think I want to?

Ain't no room, fam.

Straighten your arms, fam.

Then how am I gonna reach my food?

Oh.

Okay, I'm sorry, the cubicle will be gone soon, but this is a real make-or-break moment for me.

Either I'll look back at this as my "Steve Jobs in the garage" phase, or that misguided month where I tried to be a manager at the dining room table.

You are absolutely Jobs.

And I'm Woz sitting next to you the whole time in a... slightly lower chair.

(chuckles)

And speaking of jobs, by the way, you guys need to be like Winston and start getting jobs for Donovan.

Don't you basically work on ads for a living, Schmidt?

Yeah, well, my current account is for a menopause pill that eliminates night sweats.

Oh, you're repping EstroFuel?

Yes. Chest bump.

Nick: You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.

I mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but...

Gator!

Oh, Gator!

It's perfect.

(laughter)

He could be a great Gator.

Why don't you just use a real gator?

Schmidt: What?

Gator is Pepperwood's best friend... and clairvoyant brother.

Mm.

Oh, my bad. Sorry, I haven't read it yet.

What?

Winston: What?

Doesn't matter.

Clear the next 24 hours.

You haven't read it?

It's really not that big of a deal.

I also don't have an extra hard copy so let's just talk about something else.

Ooh, you can take mine.

(sighs)

I've highlighted the more sexual parts.

I'm not ashamed.

Great.

Great.

Now you get to read it.

Now I get to read it.

Robby's hospital bill is only $400.

That seem low to you?

Did he have a minor procedure?

No, he had what the doctors call "a full Frankenstein."

They put dog bones in his knee.

Then that's way off.

It's got to be much higher.

Do you think he thinks I can't afford the full amount?

(all agreeing)

What? Teachers have money.

You guys know how large I live. I'm flush with cash.

I'm paying that bill.

I'm going to the bank right now.

I'm probably gonna take a limousine.

Taking a limo to the bank. What is she, a cartoon cat?

(both laugh)

He kills it every time.

Every time, man.

I'm sorry we got in a fight.

I feel close again.

I'm not.

Okay, Donovan, you just caught a shoplifter and now you're celebrating with a street taco.

That's exactly it!

Get him, Donovan.

I love this.

Get him, Cece.

Yeah, okay.

Donovan, you're a natural cop.

Hey, what agency are you from? 2L?

Oh, um, hmm, I'm... from an agency that is uh, quite, um... but...

Cece's Boys.

Cece's Boys, where the men are boys, and the-and the boys are Cece's.

All right.

You like it?

I love it.

You're going downtown!

Cece: Anything you say, Officer.

(playing complicated melody)

Oh, hi, Jess.

That was really good.

Just laying down a t*nk B line.

Cool, cool. Hey, um, I feel like Baby Bill here has a lot of brothers and sisters.

So what's the real total?

No, Jess, that's it, I swear.

Come on, Robby, $400?

I know what's going on here.

You think I'm too poor to pay.

I...

But you know what?

Would a poor person... do this?

How much is it? How much?

Jess, I'm not gonna tell you, okay?

Unless you ask me repeatedly, in which case I'll eventually cr*ck. Damn it.

What's the total?

Uh.. no.

What's the total?

No.

What's the total?

Not gonna tell you.

(repeating quickly): What's the total?

$200,000.

(plays Seinfeld opening theme)

Seinfeld.

Moment of truth.

Yep, here it is.

So please don't feel any pressure to like it, even though I spent 7,000 hours writing it.

So without further ado, or as Pepperwood would say, "Ah-don't." (chuckles)

You'll get that when you read it.

Here it is.

Here it is.

I cannot wait to read this.

I cannot wait to R-E-A...

Jess!

Jess!

Hey, there she is.

Oh, me, hey.

(chuckles)

Sorry to interrupt. Are you re-reading The Pepperwood Chronicles?

It is actually my very first time.

A TPC virgin.

Yeah.

"Ah-don't..." believe it. (chuckles)

I'll get out of your hair.

No, no, no, stay.

No, what is all that stuff in your hands?

I'm totaling my assets.

It's really bleak.

You can't say that and then not elaborate, right?

No, I feel like we should really unpack this.

Really?

Definitely.

Thanks, guys.

Well, Robby's medical bills are a fifth of a million dollars and I'm freaking out.

I almost rounded up all my ballet flats and sold them on flattyflattyboomboom.com, the premier website for used flats.

Well, there are other options. There are other options.

Um, as somebody who passed the bar exam eight years ago, I could offer you legal expertise.

I could read the medical paperwork.

Oh! An almost lawyer and a sort of doctor.

Lucky me. Okay.

Strategy sesh in the cubicle.

I'll meet you guys there.

Or we can go... all go together if you want.

Together.

Yeah.

Yeah, let's go together.

Great.

I rewrote the EstroFuel ad to star a hunk, and I got Donovan the gig.

(Cece laughs)

Winston: Whoo!

Hey, everybody, Yes!

I just want to let you know, I've thought about it, and I'm quitting modeling to focus on applying to police school.

Honey, that is a very radical career change, okay?

That's why I like it. I can't be tied down.

Picture this: your mom has night sweats.

She needs relief.

Luckily, she has a handsome son to go pick up her supplements, because menopause isn't just about women anymore.

EstroFuel: putting the men back in menopause.

Starring Donovan.

Wow.

(whooping)

That's... wow, what an opportunity.

But I'm becoming a cop.

No. No!

You are the face of EstroFuel.

The sh**t is tonight.

Oh, my God, it's tonight?

And I told my boss that Cece's Boys would be there.

You told your boss...

Thank you, I'll see you there.

Winston, you ready for the tour?

Hmm?

The what?

Huh? Yea... (chuckles)

Here's what happened, let me explain this.

Um, I offered Don a tour of the precinct, he accepted, and now it's happening.

(sighs)

Okay, Winston? Winston!

Yeah?

You better make sure that this is the worst tour that you've ever given anyone in your life.

And that's gonna be tough.

I've given some really bad tours.

(sighs)

Nick: Okay, does this rendering represent the incident in question?

There was way more blood.

Wait, come on, it was not this violent.

It was way worse. Grown men fainted.

Jess, I found something.

The hospital billed Robby for the Larry King Preemptive Memorial Post-Op Recovery Suite.

That's obviously a mistake.

Uh, that's not a mistake, actually.

I needed a private room because a lot of times in my dreams, I'm thinking about concerts that I really enjoy going to, so it's just a lot of me clapping and singing along.

(sighs)

I can't afford this.

Well, you don't have to, just let me pay.

No, you don't pay. I pay!

What if no one pays?

From my drawing, I don't see any signage.

Do you see any signage? So here's my question.

Do you remember seeing any safety signs near the machine?

This is important.

There was just a poster saying that they were closed on Veteran's Day.

That's what I wanted to hear.

Folks, we got a lawsuit. (chuckling)

Good job.

Great.

Seriously, guys, just let me pay this.

Say that one more time.

Say that you're gonna pay one more time and see what happens.

Wow, okay.

You know what usually calms me down?

A good mall walk.

No, we're suing the gym.

Nick, take it away.

Well, I would love to, but legally, I can't practice law.

Yeah, I have a really good lawyer, she's an animal.

So you're on board now?

Yeah, I just go with the flow.

(phone beeps)

I'm gonna call my gal.

We need the office.

Jess: What's wrong?

Yeah, so, Schmidt booked Donovan a photo sh**t at Ass Strat, but Donovan just quit modeling so that he could become a cop.

(phone ringing)

A cop?

It's my boss, Kim.

(sighing): God, I hate her.

Hello, Kimberly. You sound like your skin looks amazing.

All right, Reagan, you can get to reading.

We can stick around if you want us to.

I don't think it's necessary.

You need us?

We'll stick around for you.

I don't think so.

Nick: Yeah, we'll stick around.

Winston!

Winston!

Me!


Did you make police work look as boring as possible?

I want so badly to tell you yes, but there was a situation.

Protect and serve, more like protect and snooze.

(sighing): Yeah, this is boring.

Bishop, a word.

And the word is...

"moo."

All: Moo!

Shut up! I-I'm the C.O.W.?

I'm the... I'm the cop of the week?

All: ♪ Celebrate good times ♪
♪ Moo moo ♪
♪ Celebrate good times ♪
♪ Moo moo ♪

I'm home!

Well, congratulations, Winston, on finally making C.O.W.

And damn you!

Cece, we're gonna have go put out a menopause f*re.

Cece: Let's go!

I made C.O.W., though.

I made C.O.W., we ain't forgetting about all that.

Robby: Okay, so, my lawyer says I don't have a case against the gym because I signed a waiver.

A waiver? Jess, you did not say anything about a waiver.

Was that it?

She didn't advise me on anything else.

Okay. (chuckles)

No one says the word "advise" unless they got advice, so what did she advise?

Uh... oh, no.

What did she advise?

She didn't... it just wasn't...

What did she advise?

It didn't...

Come on, what did she advise?

She advised that I sue!

I knew it! Who?

You.

Me?

Nick, can I read your book?

I was just about to suggest it.

Nick: Let's get out of here.

Schmidt and Cece need me.

Whoa! God, what's that smell?

(coughs)

I'm not gonna sue you, Jess. Was that not clear?

I told my lawyer that you're just an innocent bystander.

Okay? So, if we can, uh, h*t the mall?

I mean, there is a big sale at this Japanese cereal store.

It sounds amazing.

You really think I was an innocent bystander, do you?

Is that bad?

Yeah.

I'm just saying that I don't really think that you, uh, ever do anything wrong.

(laughs) Anything? Ever?

Oh, we're starting to get into this.

Look... I know a great place where we can hash this over.

It's a place called Hash It Over.

It's in the food court at the mall, it's a hash brown...

We're not going to the mall.

Why are you watching...

Why am I watching you?

Why are you?

I'm not anymore.

Okay.

Weird to watch.

That's why I'm not gonna do it.

Great.

Bye.

I thought this was about a bill, but apparently, it's about our whole relationship.

How could I date someone who doesn't see me realistically?

No, but, Jess...

I mess stuff up all the time.

Ask Nick. He knows.

Nick, do I mess things up?

You know it, baby. Bye!

I promised I wouldn't come back, but it is a little uncomfortable out there.

(low snoring)

(sighs)

Jess, I know that you have flaws.

Okay, name one.

(chuckles)

Uh... (clears throat) Easy.

You walk too fast through a museum.

Although, it is pretty good, because we get to see everything and then we have time for the cafe afterwards.

I'm gonna say that overall it enriches the experience.

That is just a compliment!

I will be in the cubicle drinking myself numb.

Please, keep fighting.

Appreciate it.

Kim: I am paying a top-notch photographer to sit around and bitch about how hard it is to find French cigarettes in Los Angeles.

Where's the model?

Changing.

Yeah, um, uh, Donovan, are you almost ready?

Winston: I am changing.

I am Donovan.

What agency did you use again?

Cece's Boys.

Look... Cece herself showed up. She's very hands-on.

That's your wife. I've met her many times.

Schmidt, if this falls through...

Look, my client will be here, and if for some reason he's not, that is on me and only me.

I'm gonna go shout into a toilet.

Okay, well, what are we gonna do now?

Babe, we are not gonna do anything, okay?

You have done so much for me, more than any normal person, and I love you.

But if I am gonna graduate from the dining room table, I need to learn how to manage my clients on my own.

(sighs) Okay.

Oh, man, that was intense.

Uh, also, Schmidt, I printed something... do you know where it went?

Not now.

Okay.

Okay, it's voice mail.

Donovan...

I know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?

But that's why being a model is... perfect for you.

Because if you're a cop, then you're just gonna be a cop.

But if you're a model, then you can be everyone.

You can be an ice cream man, a rocketeer, a jewel thief, or an underwear guy in a 10 million dollar loft whose only furniture is a telescope.

So, help me... help you... become the everyone that you can be!

That's how you do it!

That was awesome!

Yes! (chuckles)

Right?

That was amazing.

It felt good.

You think it worked?

Couldn't tell you.

Robby: I know you're capable of messing up.

Really? Because you won't even admit that the gym thing is my fault.

Your lawyer wants you to sue me, and frankly, I agree with her.

So sue me.

I am not gonna sue you.

Then how can I ever trust you?

That doesn't make any sense.

You know what? If you're not gonna sue me, then get out of here.

Fine.

But I will tell you this: you will not be hearing from my lawyer.

Bye, Nick.

Nick: See you, Robby.

I forgot you were there.

Reagan was right.

These noise-canceling headphones are really broken.

I could hear everything.

God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?

You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.

Which, apparently, my book does not have.

Nick, everyone loves it.

Robby wrote fan fiction for it.

He wrote fan fiction?

(softly): Yeah.

That means the world to me.

He loves it so much.

Don't take this the wrong way about Robby, but... he is way too good for you.

(laughs)

He's way too good for everybody.

I know.

What is wrong with me?

(sighs heavily)

Oh...

Any insight, ex to ex?

Of what's wrong with you?

Oh, this feels like a trap.

(laughs)

Well, you know, maybe when things are going good, you get scared and you look for reasons to doubt it.

Yeah.

Is that what happened with us?

I mean, I can't begin to understand what happened with us, but maybe.

So, what are you gonna do about Reagan?

I don't know. Her opinion means a lot to me, so...

Well, I think that's good you're letting yourself be vulnerable.

Was I not that with you?

Who knows what happened with us?

We were just kids. Like... you had a box, and I wanted you to get a bank account.

Well, they're kind of the same thing.

Well...

You wanted to live on a lake; I wanted to live on Mars.

You wanted to be a truck driver on Mars, which is impractical.

Well, I need to work. I need to work.

I don't want to fight with you.

Let's not fight.

Let's not get into the details again.

Look, to getting older and wiser.

And hopefully, a little bit better.

Oh, yes.

Hey.

Hi.

Cool windbreaker.

Is that new?

Yeah.

I just went to the mall; I did a little retail therapy.

Yeah.

Look, I'm really sorry about today.

I shouldn't be looking for things to go wrong.

It's just... a thing that I do.

I'm sorry, too.

I mean, sometimes I act more like a... superfan than a boyfriend.

And I don't want to do that with you.

I don't want to do my thing, either.

It's going really well.

Especially considering it started with you dropping 175 pounds of iron on my face.

So you admit it's my fault!

Okay, I'll admit that... it's half your fault.

I mean, look, I could have yelled out and said "stop" or something, but...

I wanted you to kiss me.

And hey, I'm paying that medical bill, okay?

Because... I'm rich.

Okay, fine. But I am knitting you $200,000 worth of scarves.

Final offer.

Deal.

Now stand still... I'm coming in for the romantic gesture.

Oh!

I hugged a limo driver.

Oh, my God! Nick!

Geez.

Oh... uh...

Fell asleep on my book.

It's okay.

Agatha Christie's husband, David... notoriously hated her writing.

Hated it.

But they had other things, you know?

They had surfing, dogs... they... they rescued a lot of dogs... had electric sex...

I'm afraid I'm not gonna like your book.

Thank you for stopping me...

I don't even know what I was talking about.

I don't know anything about Agatha Christie.

Honestly, I've never really liked fiction.

It puts me to sleep.

Okay.

That helps, to know that.

Why didn't you just say that before?

I was embarrassed, and I didn't want you to think that I'm not excited to read your book, because I am.

New Orleans was temporary. Okay?

Reagan has never stayed in one place too long.

If she thinks we're making a big deal, she's gonna feel smothered.

Okay? So you've got to do the opposite.

It's not a big deal.

That's why I didn't pick her up from the airport.

You didn't pick her up from the airport?

Didn't this woman change her whole job so she can move here to be with you?

She is gonna be pissed.

Uh, no.

No.

No, you're wrong. She's gonna be relieved.

Pissed.

Yeah, listen, Schmidt, it's trash.

Need I remind you that you started a petition to get Enya to play at the Super Bowl halftime show?

You're misrepresenting my petition.

Okay? I wanted her to play on the field during the fourth quarter.

Schmidt, I bet I could make a fake EDM song and you couldn't tell it apart from a real one.

'Cause they all sound like a robot having a seizure.

This is bad. Really bad.

Yeah, it's not good.

You need to calm down. All right, just take a breath.

See, it's working already.

Besides, you don't even know what you told Reagan.

I know she said that we have a secret between us.

You don't just say that.

Okay, all right. Tell me what you remember.

Let's just piece together what happened.

Just the two of you?

Oh, look.

This bar has hooks for our purses. [chuckles]

Score. Thank you.

Skip to the next track.

Splash, bitch, splash!

I'm gonna splash you in your dumb wet face.

[laughing] I really need to wash my hands.

New friend!

New friend!

Is this leading to the secret?

I don't know, Cece.

My brain is a smoking wreckage and I'm trying to find the black box.

Okay, let's try to jump-start it.

Okay? Let me try something.

Secret!

Secret!

Secret!

What are you doing?

Secret!

This is not gonna work.

Secret!

It was something about a pool.

Oh, my God, Cece.

You're amazing. You should work for the CIA.

I know. Stay focused on the pool.

I hate the way that tastes.

Idea.

What?

Let's go to the pool.

Is "pool" cocaine?

I mean, is "the pool," like, a drug thing?

'Cause I don't "swim."

Like, I-I don't judge people who do "swim," but I don't.

No, it's a real pool.

An actual pool at my apartment, my other apartment.

[gasps]

[whispers]: I have another apartment.

No, no...

It's a secret.

Don't tell Nick, don't tell Nick.

No.

Shh.

Oh, no.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

Okay, well, it's time to do future Jess a solid and black the hell out.

Reagan has a secret apartment.

A secret apartment?

Past Jess was trying to keep me out of this.

What is she, a D.C. madam?

I have to make sure Nick never finds out about this.

You know what?

I'm gonna stay out of it.

Hmm.

Classic Jess, staying all the way out of it.

When we are done with this song, Schmidt will totally think it is by Diplo or Garrix or Deadmau5.

What is this?

Don't worry about that, your mind is in a weird situation.

First things first.

I recorded a bunch of noises around the loft.

Right?

Mm-hmm.

So we could use it as the hook.

It is the mark of any EDM song.

Okay.

Now, check this one out.

Nick shaving without shaving cream.

[Nick grunting]

He's bleeding at this point.

It's good, I'm just laughing at...

Yeah, it's nasty.

... just seeing him.

Okay, check this one out.

Schmidt: Haberman, my Haberman. Haberman. My Haberman. My-my-my-my Haberman.

This one has a pretty good rhythm to it.

All right, this one right here is about to set the city up topsy-turvy.

All right.

Ferguson... going to town on Jess's bunny slippers.

[restrained laughter]

It's not... nothing.

Ferguson, you nasty.

Did you h*t the button?

You see, he's a gentle lover. You understand?

That's why you can't really hear anything, but you can feel what the slipper is feeling.

There's no sound.

No, you got to...

He's a...

I can't hear anything. he's a gentle lover.

There's no sound in there!

He's a gentle lover!

You're just there with the phone and there's no sound.

Hello.

You don't understand. Oh, hey.

Yeah, it's not so easy, is it?

Can't just snap your fingers and become a couple of Calvin Harrises-e-es.

Winston: Listen, this is all part of our process, okay?

So b*at it.

Yeah. Shoo.

We got a song to write that's gonna give you the best damn aural you have ever had.

Check yourself.

Oh, A-U-R-A-L.

Mmm.

Cece: For your ears.

Yeah.

Well, I will see you on game day, suckas.

No, that actually almost works.

Hmm? Oh, I recorded some candid audio.

Yeah, I need this track to be real.

Jess: Reagan has a secret apartment.

Cece: A secret apartment?

Schmidt: Haberman.

Winston: What?!

I can't believe my girlfriend has a secret apartment!

I'm sure there's some explanation.

I can think of one of two things.

One, she's worried she's making a mistake by living with me.

Or two, and this one is way more realistic, she has a secret family.

Only men have secret families.

Look, just go talk to Reagan.

I can't just run into the bathroom shouting, "You have a secret apartment," Jess.

She'll bolt... to her secret apartment!

You talk to her.

Find out what the deal is.

No way I'm getting involved.

You leaked the intel to Cece.

You're deeper than any of us.

I was secretly recorded.

That is a felony, by the way.

This is between you and Reagan.

Jess, you've got to talk to her.

You've got to deal with this. She trusts you.

Please, you've got to help.


[knocking]

Hey...

Ray Ray.

Boo Boo?

Is this about the apartment?

Damn.

Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.

Whatever the explanation, it's okay.

I don't need to know anything except, like, when did you get it, is it, like, a real, genuine place, or is it, like, a playing it cool thing, like Nick's fake bar shift?

What?

What?

You said "fake bar shift," so does that mean that he didn't have to go to work, and that he lied to me?

Oh my God, you know who should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.

No. No.

Nick!

I don't want to talk to him...

Hey, Nick! Nick!

.... about anything.

Oh, weird.

I had no idea you were having a conversation [chuckling]: with Reagan right now.

We are in the middle of a conversation that we need to finish, so maybe we'll do that over drinks.

Did you have other plans?

Maybe you wanted to have a conversation with somebody.

Well, I'd love to finish our conversation, Jess, so maybe you and I should get a drink.

You know what? After last night, the only drink I can handle is... room temperature milk.

You guys got crazy?

Don't worry about it.

I just really would want to be able...

I would love to...

Nick: ... finish our conversation.

We started ours first, so we should finish ours earlier.

It's basic time science.

It's time science?

Yeah, it's time science.

You told me that you don't believe in watches or clocks, so I don't really think this is a very valid argument.

No, I said I believe in watches, I just don't trust who sets them.

Who sets the time?

You set the time.

Why would I set the time? It's my watch.

Okay, see? Talking is fun.

Why don't you guys continue this conversation... at the bar... by yourselves, without me?

I'll have a milk.

So in front of you, you have two songs, one by a recognized EDM "artist," quotes intended, the other is by me.

Park?

[laughing]

Stores!

Oh!

Brick and mortar, baby!


[shattering]

I know that she loves me, so why won't she touch me?

Larry, you've got to go home, okay?

Why isn't Nick gone?

It's been four hours.

Reagan's on a plane, Secret Santa's in an hour, I'm freaking out...

Well, you can call me Ice Cube.

Because I'm done wrapping.

That is how you won me over.

Look, the missing piece of the puzzle is Nick.

I'm gonna go check in.

One hour till Secret Santa!

Great.

You ever done any Santa work at the Chatsworth Penney's?

Larry?

Robby!

[crying, sniffling]

[knocking]

Come in.

A little North Pole knock-knock. [chuckles]

I finished.

Oh.

Thank you, Jess. And thank you for what you said about being with the people you care about on Christmas.

Oh, you're welcome. I-I meant it.

And that is why I bought a ticket... to go to Seattle to be with Reagan tonight.

Oh... Fa...

♪ La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. ♪

[laughs]

All right. How do I surprise Reagan.

Here's what I'm thinking.

I'm thinking I go dressed as a fireman, I knock on the door, I reveal myself to be a stripper, and then I reveal myself to be Nick.

How does that even... uh...

Are you sure you want to go to Seattle?

I mean, it's Seattle. Ew.

I mean, it was... it was basically your idea, right?

Why don't we just get you home to...

I got no time.

I'm on a no-fly list, so I need to leave right now.

Checking in is very difficult.

Why not just take that name literally, and you no fly?

Off to Seattle.

Wait, Nick! No! No!

I can't let you go! Your hair looks so stupid!

What?

You look like a total dork.

My hair looks stupid, I look like a total dork?

We can't let TSA see you like this.

But I've had this haircut for a little bit now.

I know.

You let me go to work, though?

It just looks particularly bad right this minute.

Then I'll just go like this.

How about now?

No. Mm-mm. Didn't fix it.

I get the impression you don't want me to go to Seattle.

That's because I don't want you to go to Seattle.

Well, why not?

I can't tell you.

I mean, I-is this about Reagan?

Do you not like her?

No, I like Reagan... she looks like the front of a ship come alive. Heh.

Is that why you've been acting so weird?

I haven't been acting weird.

You've been weird since the day I got back from New Orleans.

You're acting really squirrelly.

You don't think I've noticed, but I've noticed.

Okay, you're way off base.

I mean, what is it? I took your advice...

I'm gonna be with somebody who I find really special on Christmas.

Nick...

But, surprise, I've still done something wrong.

Don't go to Seattle. Trust me.

Why is nothing I do ever good enough for you?

What do you want from me?

I'm doing everything I can here!

Nick, I'm flying Reagan out from Seattle to surprise you.

I'm your Secret Santa, you jerk.

So this is what it feels like to be instantly sorry.

Schmidt: Where is everyone?

I thought this place would be crazy.

Ha-ha-ha!

Yeah, those were the days.

Now people prefer to shop online.

My grandfather opened this store.

Now it closes with me. So, to answer your question, yes, I do drink.

Um... hey, we're looking for a beanbag chair.

Hey! We have one.

Nice!

Heck, I'll go get it for you. I'm not doing anything.

Great, great.

Brick and mortar, baby.

[sighs]

A beanbag chair, Winston?

Yeah.

You thought that would be a... a suitable gift for my bride?

You wouldn't get it. I mean, it's a reference to a classic Winston-Cece mess-around.

Beanbag chair!

Never in my life have I heard of a game of one-on-one Pictionary.

We had a moment.

Unmoved.

Okay.

Had you drawn a picture poo-poo, would that have been a good gift for my Cece?

[laughing]: It would have been hilarious.

Look, Schmidt, I get it that you are closer to her than I am.

Uh-huh.

However, I got my own thing going on with her.

And I feel like you don't respect that.

Closer to her?

You are.

That's a good way to describe our relationship, comparatively to yours.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yes, considering we are man and wife.

Yeah.

Winston, this is a very cozy, [sighs] inoffensive blanket.

Get it.

Has no relevance towards our relationship.

Why would I do that?

Get the blanket.

No.

Winston, please.

Just get the blanket and let's go.

Well, since you asked nicely, no.

Just get the blanket.

No. I don't want the damn blanket.

Here's the beanbag chair.

Yeah, stores are the best.

Hey, you guys want to go get lunch or something?

Nah. How much is it?

It's $249.99.

What? For a beanbag chair?

For a beanbag chair?

Well, we have a cheaper one... we're just, we're out of stock.

I could order it for you, but it would take seven to ten days.

Man, stores are the worst.

The admiral will take this.

Whatever happened to Hanukkah?

Hey, Jess, about that... the-the stuff I s...

Oh, wait, it's fine... I...

I must have seemed so crazy.

Let's just enjoy the holiday, okay?

Okay, Secret Santa.

By now, the suspense must be k*lling you.

As you all know, uh, Nick knows his Secret Santa gift is Reagan flying out from Seattle to surprise him.

All right.

Merry Christmas, Nick.

All right, Cece. That big boy's for you.

What in the hell is that?

Winston, what'd you do with the thing we just bought?

[gasps]

Beanbag chair!

Beanbag chair! It's from Winston!

Winston: They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.

Winston, you remembered our game night. I love it.

You do?

She does.

I do.

Well, you know what, Winston?

You were right... it's the perfect gift.

I guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that my wife is a little bit weirder than I thought she was.

It's a prototype, you know?

The real one's on its way.

Didn't have a lot of beans, so I had to pad it with rice and oatmeal.

It's a great gift. Thank you.

It's perfect!

Good job.

All right, well, whoever got Schmidt better have brought it, 'cause Winston set the bar really high.

Oh, here we go, here we go.

Here we go. Ooh...

Ooh...

Cashmere socks! Dayanu!

[chuckles]

Well, it's not Winston, it's not Jess.

Cece?

No. No, it's not me.

I got you, boy.

No way.

I got you. This is me.

This is you?

Nicholas! [laughs]

Yeah, come on.

I don't know why I'm finding the image of you mispronouncing the word "cashmere" in a store... to be so joyful.

"Cadsh-mer."

Winston.

Oh.

Ha-ha! I get one?

Oh, man.

Yeah. Everybody gets one.

That's crazy. I get one, too.

You know.

Yeah, everybody does.

Aah! For me?

Oh, my stars! A check made out to my phone company?

Cece, girl, is this for that night we got b*mb and called Iceland?

You know it is!

Okay, hold on, wait a minute, I had... I had Winston, too.

Somebody got left out. Who didn't get one?

Oh, Winnie got two gifts?

That's for Winston.

Yeah.

Oh... no, no, it's... it's fine.

It's... it's my fault.

I must have gotten so tipsy on Halloween, I forgot to write down my own name.

See? It's right there in the song.

He makes a list, he checks it twice.

See, this is probably why Santa stopped drinking.

Well, here, you know what?

Have this one.

Oh, my God, a hamster?!

You're a pet guy, man.

I am. I am.

But... Jess, you... you should have him.

No. I-I got the best gift of all.

Watching you guys give each other gifts that show you care.

Well, you can't not have a gift.

Besides, Ferguson's gonna eat him, anyway.

Oh. Well, if... if Ferguson will eat him, then I...

I'll take him.

Thanks, Winston.

Of course.

Great Secret Santa, everyone.

You want to go to bed, little guy?

You want to see your new room?

[sighs]

I feel horrible.

You have no idea. She and I got in a thing.

I said something so stupid.

[door opens]

Sleigh!

Others: Hey, Reagan.

Hey.

Really?

Do you know how hard it was to put this thing on in an airplane bathroom?

Do I.

If you don't get off that wheel right now, there's gonna be hell to pay.

Now!

Whoa. Did you understand me?

[door opens]

Oh, you're awa... you're awake. Great.

Nick, how often do you sneak into my room in the middle of the night?

Uh, that you're awake, uh, this is a first.

Here.

Weird.

Here's some cocoa.

Hey, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about what I said.

I know you are. Thanks.

I also want to say thank you.

Even though I knew Reagan was coming, when I saw her I felt like it was Christmas morning and I was ten.

But a ten-year-old about to have sex... with Santa!

And it was... yeah, this is getting weird.

Anyway, I just wanted to say...

I'm sorry and thank you.

So they call our names and we can't decide what song to sing.

I want to do Journey, of course.

And Jess wants to Adele.

Of course.

We can't decide.

Jess: Hail Mary... we decide to do The Doors!

And we bring the house...

[laughing]: down.

[grunts]

Oh, that's the end?

Yeah.

Riveting.

I like the story.

You know, The Doors?

Man, that's a nice white group.

Yeah, I love that you two are dating.

Well, Cece and I have moved on to a very different and more exciting chapter.

We'd like to invite all of you to a walkthrough of our new kitchen.

We have finally have walls.

Got the walls!

Wait, you're just getting walls now?

Who's building your house?

Congress? [laughs]

So relevant.

To the news of today.

Mm-hmm.

Truth be told, we've had some trouble with our contractor.

He's a real Joe Public.

Just a newspaper-and-dump kind of guy.

Robby, hey.

I haven't seen you at the marina.

Robby: Hey, Joan. I know. I haven't been sailing much since I broke most of my body and face.

Oh, you look good to me.

We should grab dinner.

Or breakfast.

Or both.

[Robby laughing]

Uh, I don't know.

But it's really great to see you so far inland.

Great to see you, too. [chuckles]

Keep it moving, Joan.

Your purse don't match your bangs.

Sorry about that, Jess.

Why are you sorry?

[mouth full]: The boat lady was h*t...

The boat lady was hitting on him.

Right in front of you.

So?

I don't own him.

He's not the box set of Felicity.

Question, because I'm invested.

Um, are you two exclusive?

Oh, well, we haven't had...

Well, I mean... a proper conversation about it.

Yeah, I don't think...

Jess: There's a whole...

This feels like a private conversation...

Shhhh!

Respectfully, I'd like to take it slow, you know?

'Cause I'm always diving into the deep end in relationships... and I'd kind of like to splash around the shallow end.

I get it. Let's just let this chicken marinate.

So, what are we looking at here?

Uh, open relationship?

Friends with benefits?

The old "dog and bone" situation?

We're just two people hanging out in a cool and modern way. [chuckles]

Welcome to the future.

What exactly is a "dog and bone" situation?

I'm assuming you-you're the bone...

You know damn well I was the bone!

Almost broke my neck.

I am terrified about what women have done to you, Winston.

We all got to get off, right?

We all got to get...

I'm gonna need you to leave.

I saw that coming.

♪ ♪

Ooh! Officer and a Gentlemen!

Yes. Nice.

Um, Die Hard 2!

I truly love pre-movie trivia.

Me, too, and I love seeing the local advertisements.

I like knowing who's hot in the teeth-whitening game.

[chuckles]

Also, Robby, I just want to say...

I'm really happy we're both on the same page about taking it slow.

I feel really great about it.

Me, too.

And, actually, I got a date this weekend.

[laughing]

Really?

With the boat lady?

Oh, no, it's a woman I work with at the factory, Babs.

You work in a factory?

Well, no, actually, um, I design them.

Oh, well, that's not fascinating at all. [chuckles]

That's fresh from the sarcasm factory, [laughs] 'cause it is fascinating.

Thought you would've mentioned that before.

You guys ask me surprisingly little about my personal life.

You're okay with this, right?

I mean, you wanted to see other people.

Yeah. Yeah, I definitely said that.

Yeah, I actually have a date, too.

You do?

Mm-hmm.

With who?

Shh, trailers are starting.

Okay, this way. Come on in.

Wait, so Robby has a date? That was so fast.

The man didn't waste any time.

But you know what? It's okay, 'cause I'm dating, too.

But you aren't, though. Your guy's fake.

Can we come back to Robby designing factories?

The man is an enigma.

He's my second best friend, and I know nothing about him.

Now, can we please focus?

We are doing a formal walkthrough.

Behold, the kitchen of tomorrow.

Where are the dang walls?!

Mr. Jason said one week at the latest.

No! No! No!

Uh, a minute alone with the boy?

Hey, bud.

Nick...

I am at my wit's end here.

Should I call the Better Business Bureau?

Better Business Bureau... that's not a real thing...

It's a very real thing... and as a man who co-owns a small business with you, I'm alarmed.

You just got to know how to talk to these people.

Schmidt: There's Mr. Jason over there.

See the brunette with his arms crossed?

Nick: Okay, let me take a cr*ck at this.

And don't call men brunettes.

We've talked about this before.

That's a nice grain.

Great grain.

Got to cut with the grain.

Uh, always.

Watch the fingers.

It's a living.

Get the hands dirty.

Yeah, you know, early bird gets the worm.

[laughs]

Clean your jeans.

Ask her what time it is, she'll tell you to build a watch, you know?

[both laugh]

Would you look at that?

It's good, though. It's good framing.

Ah, it's beautiful, stuff, yeah.

These guys are good.

You guys have done beautiful stuff.

Where does a modern girl go to make a fake guy real?

That is an insane combination of words.

It's not the Internet, a bar or a nightclub, 'cause I'm uncomfortable with all those.

You're taking a lot of options off the table.

And are you sure you're just not scared to get serious with Robby because you don't want to get hurt?

No, I'm not scared, I just... don't want to start a relationship with someone I barely know.

I mean, he has a boat.

What's next, a kid?

And then I have to meet the boat and the kid at some weird sea luncheon?

Honestly, playing the field sounds really exciting to me.

You know, going to strange places with strange men.

Sign me up for that.

You know, that certainly sounds like you, Jess.

You know what, you should just start right now.

There's a lot of guys here.

You should go and... talk to one.

At a construction site?

We... support it.

Jess: Okay, I can't tell if you're mocking me... but fine, I'll go have a look around.

Fine.

Fine.

I see what you did there.

Yeah, the quicker this plays out, the sooner she'll realize how ridiculous she's being.

Now, I'm not trying to break stones over here, but what can we do about these walls?

I can't do the walls until they do the electric, and I can't do the electric without my guy.

You got to have your guy, I get it, but what am I gonna do?

Jason: If I could I would, but I'm not Santa Claus. What do you want me to do?

What? Do I need to get your mother out here to do it?

'Cause I'll call your mother. I got her in my phone.

You're gonna call my mother?

Yeah, I'm gonna call your mother.

All right, you sack of crap.

[laughing]

I'll make a call.

Thank you.

All right.

Great!

What the hell was that?

Oh, he's gonna call his guy... he's gonna see what he can do about the walls.

Thank goodness. I thought it was gonna be a physical altercation.

Nah, he's a good guy, he's a good guy.

Salt of the earth.

It's more about what's unsaid, you know?

What it comes down to at the end of the day is respect.

And I have it for him and he has it for me.

Interesting.

So Mr. Jason doesn't respect me?

Oh, God, no.

Hmm.

I mean, Schmidt, I love you, but... but you're not a man of the people.

Of course I'm not a man of the people... I'm above the people.

I want the people to build things for me.

And that's where I come in.

I can't rely on your... crass Chicago street smarts forever.

I'm a homeowner, and I'm a husband, and hopefully, one day I'll be a father.

If he's not gonna respect me, then I need to become someone that he will.

That sounds a little scary.

Who-who are you looking to become, Schmidt?

You.

Ugh.

Anyway, if any of you gentlemen are looking for something modern and non-exclusive...

You got a nail in your ass.

Oh. Um, that's not my ass, that's actually my dress. [groans]

Could one of you guys help me?

No, we're busy right now.

Come on.

Oh. Thank you...

Es good?

Es very good. [chuckles]

Mm! So, how's Babs?

Is she puttin' out?

[both laughs]

Well, she's great. I-I haven't gone out with her yet, but I look forward to getting to know her in a relaxed and modern way.

Great.

I'm ready to tell you about my guy now.

His name is Stavros, and he is Greek, which is exciting.

That's... very exciting.

Yeah...

He sounds... sounds very sexy.

I can't believe she met a man at a construction site.

I mean, I'm kind of impressed.

He thinks it's really funny how big our drinks are.

They are big.

I'm concerned Robby doesn't care.

They're testing each other.

Look at his bottom lip.

Stavros is taking me to a club on Friday.

Ah. Yeah... okay. I get it. He cares.

Okay, uh... we were supposed to go out on Friday.

Oh! I'm sorry. You know what?

Should I cancel?

No. It's okay.

I'll just go out on Friday with Babs.

Sounds fun.

It's gonna be fun.

Or... crazy idea.

What if we all hang out together?

Very interesting. Like a double date?

That seems precarious.

Oh, it's totally just gonna blow up in their faces, and they're gonna need us when it does, so we should probably be on call.

Absolutely. Yeah.

We're a very important part of this.

What'd I tell you? They're putting the electrical in.

Ta-da!

Don't say ta-da around these guys.

And why are you wearing my clothes?

I'm you.

You are making this way creepier than it needs to be.

But let's work on your stance, okay?

Okay.

You're gonna want to adjust your pants a lot, like watch me.

Like this. Just like looking around, checking it out, adjust your pants; try it.

Just do it normal, just do it normal.

Don't make that face.

Regular face.

If you're gonna do anything with your shoulders, it's this.

Just relax...

No. You're doing this...

Don't do that here. It's like this...

Okay, let's try something else.

I think you-you need to slouch a little bit, 'cause all these people have back pain.

Look, I'm sorry that I have good posture.

I'm not on my hands and knees all day slapping hot tar on a roof.

I'm sitting in an ergonomic office chair like a frickin' gentleman.

So, here's a way to give a compliment.

It's... you insult somebody, that's a way to show affection.

Like, hey, you ugly piece of crap, you got humongous ears.

So you're too insecure to show affection, so you do the opposite.

And if you're ever in a pinch, and the moment's getting on top of you, just mention the game.

[whispering]: You got this, man.

You got this.

Hey, what's up dum-dum?

I'm sorry, I was breaking so much b*lls before.

I had a really stressful day at the office.

You know, the, uh, boss was really giving it to me, so I kicked his ass, but I'm better.

Hey, uh, I know how it goes, bud.

So now that we have the electrical, maybe we can get started on the walls?

Wh-what do you say, bud?

Oh, uh, we're gonna have to wait on the inspection.

And that could take a few months.

A few months?!

Any way we could speed this process along?

What do you say, you dirty slut?

Slut?

Look, this a city issue.

But we could, uh, throw a little money at the situation.

See what we see.

Throw a little bit of money, see what we see.

Who do I make the check out to? Los Angeles?

Or ma-make it to cash.

There you go.

Yeah. All right.

Now we're talking. Ow!

Caught a little bit of my ween in there.

You all right?

Just the tip, just the tip of the ween.

Okay.

Jess: Wow.

Your house is amazing.

Who lives here, Vin Diesel?

No. But we do share a gardener.

This is Stavros.

He brought homemade wine.

Thank you, Stavros. Looks, uh, very fresh.

[Stavros speaking Greek]

Is that right?

Does he speak English?

No. But his last name has 17 consonants, which I find very charming.

Sure.

So where's Babs?

Putting her grandkids to bed?

[chuckles]

Hey.

[gasps]

I'm Babs.

[chuckling]: This is gonna be fun.

To life!

This bottle's very warm.

So, Babs, um, you work at the factory with Robby?

I'm the head engineer.

Robby: Babs is a genius physicist.

She got her doctorate from Cambridge.

Wow. I didn't...

I mean, that's very impressive.

Stavros is from a rich tradition of, uh, craftsman.

Without men like him, we wouldn't have houses to live in, or delicious wine to drink with friends.

[chuckling]: Salud.

Salud.

Yamas.

[all gagging, except Stavros]

[choking]: Oh... it burns.

Es good?

Es good.

Es good?

It's good.


Is that a gold record on your wall?

Robby: Hmm?

Oh, yeah. I-I played bass on a Santana album.

Who are you?

Yeah, there's... there's no updates yet.

I wonder how it's going.

Mm, mm, mm.

Waiter has my credit card, in case we need to leave, we're ready.

Okay.

Yeah.

Hey, let me ask you something.

You think we're too involved in Robby and Jess?

It could be argued that this is a little unhealthy.

Mm.

What does it really say about us, you know?

Are we just so bored with our own lives now that we're settled and in love?

Nah, that's not what's happening here, okay? [laughs]

We're not bored.

Right.

All right. I got a lot of stuff going on.

Yeah.

Whoo-ho.

Let me start from the top.

Okay.

Let me tell you, last week?

Yeah.

I had ants in my room.

Yeah. What else, what else, what else, what else?

Ooh, I think I'm gonna try the crab breast.

Did it.

Sure did.

You know what's crazy?

Not only did I get Mr. Jason to respect me, but I think I learned to respect him a little bit, too.

I like the people; so wild and lazy.

If you want, I could take you to the store I get my jeans.

It's actually just a Mexican supermarket.

Give it to me.

I got it.

Give it to me...

You okay?

Give it to me.

Look at the suds.

You ruined a beer.

Schmidt: Ah, there he is.

Hey-o. Working late.

So, Mr. Jason, did we get the inspection, or are we gonna keep waiting around like a couple of jamooks?

Eh, threw some sawdust on the puddle, but it's still wet.

I don't know... is that a bad thing or good thing?

Means he didn't get it.

Hey, blame the city.

I hate the city!

Stup-stupid city.

Well, you know what, Mr. Jason? You tried.

Thank you for that.

I guess you can just give us our money back.

Oh, I don't have your money.

We didn't get the inspection, though.

Well, I said we'd see what we see.

And this is what we saw...

You get it.

I don't think that I do get it. Do we get it, Nick?

Do I, do I... I don't get it.

Do you get it?

I get it.

Aren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?

These are extra.

I'm gonna use them on another job.

Nick: Oh, at another job.

Oh, it... and he left with them.

What does he do? I don't understand...

What's happening? What is happening?

Oh, I get it. I get it.

We got ripped off.

God... I knew it.

How did I not see this coming?

Maybe I've lost touch with the people.

Serves me right being such a damn success.

I'm sitting in my ivory tower like Dan Brown!

Nick, you're a very talented writer, but you're no Dan Brown.

You've never even had anything published.

Well, if I'm no Dan Brown, and I'm no man of the people, then who am I?

Stop having an identity crisis! Now is not the time.

What we need to do is come up with a plan that combines both of our strengths.

I like this.

Here's what I'm thinking.

We invite Mr. Jason over for the game.

And while I'm hosting the hell out of him, you sneak down, and you steal those pipes out of his truck.

Let's do this, man! Let's do this!

Nobody rips us off.

Nobody rips us off!

Let's do it!

I think what you wanted to do was more like that.

Why didn't mine break?

It's really easy to break it, you just...

[grunting]

Ten seconds.

Ten seconds.

Choiros. Choiros chrimata!

What does that mean?

What does that mean?

Choiros chrimata!

What does that mean?

I think, I think he's saying "pig money." Is it pig money?

Time!

[laughter]

Well, it was piggy bank, which is close enough.

We gave you "garbanzos" for "chick peas."

I'm afraid we cannot allow it, Jess.

Man, we are wrecking you guys.

It's probably 'cause me and Babs have, uh, such a strong connection.

Whatever. It's just 'cause you speak the same language.

I like to date people that I can communicate with.

Good for you. Where's the wine?

I like it now.

I think it's making me hallucinate.

Mm-hmm. Me, too.

You know what? It's of good quality.

♪ Last night I thought to back when we made good love... ♪

Oh, you're singing now?

♪ Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye ♪
♪ All night long... ♪

[Jess sings along, trying to copy him]

[singing continues]

♪ Good loving body rocking ♪

[Stavros and Jess sing]

♪ All night long ♪

[Stavros and Jess sing]

♪ All night long... ♪

Enough!

What is wrong with you, Robby?

What's wrong with me?

You're the one who wanted to see other people!

I said I wanted to take it slow.

I didn't say I want a front row seat to your date with some movie scientist.

This is a weird night.

Well, welcome to my world, Babs.

Jess, you don't know what you want.

I mean, do you like me? Do you not like me?

Are we in a relationship? Are we not?

[singing in Greek]

Thank you, Stavros. That'll do.

I'm gonna go.

[groans slightly]

Yeah, well... I think we should all go.

[groans]

Stavros, thank you for the psychedelic wine, but I would like you to leave my house now so that I can throw up.

Jess, we go disco?

♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ♪
♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ♪
♪ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz... ♪

Maybe our lives are boring.

Mm-hmm.

Or... are we just happy?

Follow me on this one.

Okay.

Would you want to be dating still?

Hell, no.

Thank you.

I am happy!

You know, and happy... sometimes it's a little bit boring, but, you know, I have a great marriage.

And who needs the drama? No.

Not me.

As of right now, I am washing my hands of all this Jess and Robby nonsense.

I feel you.

I'm out!

Jess just texted. She needs us.

I'm in! Let's go!

We're in!

Okay, that slime ball is on his way.

Are you wearing my jeans?

Yeah. I'm all mixed up, and I can't get 'em off.

Well, that's 'cause they fit. They look fantastic.

If you get 'em wet, I'm gonna flip out.

[knocking]

Let's do this.

Hey, hey, big game for the boys, huh?

Big games for the boys is right. Mr. Jason, come on in.

Ah. Nice.

Have a seat.

Nick, uh, want to go take care of that thing?

Oh, yeah, I got to fix the boiler.

Oh, gas or steam?

Double?

It's a, it's a double. It sure is a double.

Mr. Jason, it's good to see you!

Thank you so much for having me over. This is gonna be a good game.

Are you hungry? We've got some food.

I've got sausages and brats, all the sports meats.

You know, I don't eat meat. I'm a vegan.

You...

[loud metallic clinking and clanking]

[loud metallic clanking]

[Nick grunts]

[Nick grunts]

Hey!

It's not what it looks like, Mr. Jason!

It must be hard to order as a vegan in a restaurant.

Oh!

[indistinct chatter]

[whoops]

What is happening?

What are we doing here?

How was the date? Tell us everything.

Babs was a real catch, I drank too much hallucinogenic wine, um, screwed everything up with Robby, and now I'm at a... Greek rave.

There's a rotisserie in the back if you're hungry.

Honey, what is this about?

Are you really that scared of getting hurt?

I'm not afraid of how it's gonna end.

I'm afraid of how it started.

Like, I've been so hesitant from the beginning.

Like, I need to be convinced.

Just, there's no love story called Hemming and Hawing.

Winston: Actually, there is.

Jose Canseco self-published it on the Internet.

It's about a lamb that marries a CEO.

Cece: Jess, I think you should be having this conversation with Robby.

Or maybe I need to be having this conversation with Robby!

How much wine have you had to drink?

I don't know.

It was in a soda bottle. Look, don't stop me.

I'm gonna go find Robby!

[Winston whistles]

Uh...

Robby: Hi, uh, I'm looking for a girl named Jess!

She wears glasses. Kind of like this?

I know that's not a lot to go on, but the glasses are, like, her-her whole thing really.

He's here, he's here!

Robby?!

Hey!

Cece! Winston!

Hey!

I'm looking for Jess.

Well, she's looking for you.

Yeah, she's looking for you.

Really?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's...

Yeah, she's about to leave.

I want to get out of this joint!

What's Greek for exit?

Jess?!

Oh. Hi.

Jess!

Robby!

I don't want to see other people.

And also, I'm eating a falafel 'cause I'm-I'm really, really drunk.

I'm really drunk, too, and I don't want to see anyone else, either.

Jess: We just got off to such a rough start.

I don't care how it started. I just care where it goes.

I like you.

I like you, too!

You're stealing my pipes?! Unbelievable!

You are breaking my b*lls into oblivion!

You broke my b*lls first. I got a scrotum full of whipped cream.

Oh!

You stole our money, man!

I told you, I tried to get the permit.

It didn't work out.

You got screwed over, but I didn't do it.

Then why did you take my pipes?

I bought 'em back to use at another job.

It's in your invoice!

I actually saved you money!

If that's true, I am so thankful.

That's really nice of you, Mr. Jason.

Yeah, great job.

Thank you.

You're really good contractor then.

Mr. Jason?

Are you... are you crying?

It's not easy being a contractor.

I'm always the bad guy.

I just want to build other people's dreams.

Well, I feel like a buffoon.

You know what, Mr. Jason? We misjudged you.

Big time.

And ourselves.

If we hadn't been so hung up on labels, we would've been able to see each other for who we are.

You're Mr. Jason.

Call me Jason. What's with the Mr. Jason?

You're a vegan.

Get out.

You know, it takes 53 gallons of water to produce a single chicken egg?

That's why!

Great!

What do you say we hug it out?

All right.

Oh, there you go.

There you go.

There you go, Mr. Jason.

I don't usually do this.

[patting Mr. Jason rhythmically]

It's nice.

Yeah, it's nice.

All right.

Oh, that's a tight squeeze.

Oh, boy. Ooh, what a grip.

Can't breathe You weren't actually in Santana.

You just met the band when you were delivering pizza to the studio?

Carlos found out that I played bass somehow, and then he asked me to sit in.

Huh.

Thus began the brief career I had as a studio session musician when I was a junior in high school.

I managed the girls JV wrestling team.

That's really cool, too.

It was cool.

Mm-hmm.

Anyway, tell me literally everything that's ever happened to you.

You should just watch the PBS special.

What?!

ROBBY: I saved a guy's life.

Jess: What? Whose life?

Do you know who Elon Musk is?





Babe, can you help me finish this thank you card to Asha Auntie?

She got us... that.

Schmidt: That porpoise p*rn?

Yeah.

"Best, comma, Cece and Schimdt."

All we're gonna give her is a "Best, comma"?

Come on, she's my mom's sister.

Well, she should have stuck to the registry.

You know who hasn't even gotten us a present yet?

I have a year.

He has a year.

I have a year!

[door closes]

All right, everyone.

Report to the principal's office, where I will be sitting behind the desk because...

I might be principal!

Congrats!

That's great!

What do you mean, could be principal?

Well, I just had a very interesting talk with my boss, Genevieve.

Jess, I am dying.

What? Oh, my God!

Dying to leave Banyon Canyon and launch my own elementary school at sea.

Oh. You scared the bejesus out of me.

I've wanted this forever and I came so close at my last school.

Like, champagne and Prosecco close.

So, if you find marijuana in a locker, it's yours now.

Ours now. It could just be part of the loft.

We could just put it in a...

Congratulations.

You just got yourself two weeks detention, Mr. Miller.

What? But I didn't do anything!

I didn't do anything!

[sighs]

♪ ♪

Principal, that's great. I'm really proud of you.

And now you're almost gonna make what normal people make.

But I'm not even in it for the cabbage.

I want to change lives.

And finally, I can implement some of my programs school-wide, like the math decathlon... the demathlon.

A-ha!

[Winston laughing]

You see this whole time, y'all thought you were having breakfast with Winston, but it turns out y'all been sitting with James Wonder.

I'm talking about my alias.

See, I'm thinking about applying for undercover work.

That sounds incredibly dangerous.

Well, not if I go deep enough into my undercover character.

I've been practicing on y'all unknowin' asses.

I combined the names of my favorite singers...

Stevie Wonder and James Blunt.

And I put those together to create a different name as my alias, James Wonder.

I'm worried you're not the undercover type of guy.

I feel like if you had the ability to pretend to be someone else, you would have made that decision a long time ago.

I feel like that sounded harsh, but it's only 'cause I care about you.

Jess: I love Parents' Day!

Matching names to e-mail addresses, puttin' big people in little chairs.

Admiring all that sweet daddy derriere.

Yeah, I'm not doing that.

Good. More for me.

Ooh. That is Ed Warner.

President of the parent's council.

You're gonna need his vote if you want to become principal, so...

Okay, did you talk me up?

Absolutely not.

School politics gets messy and as my grandmother used to say, "You don't get dirty till after 6:30."

Piece of cake. Parents love me.

Ed!

Oh, are-are you okay?

[chuckling]: Sorry, I was, uh, moved to tears by the... second grader's self-portraits.

I cannot believe you are gonna abandon us next year.

Oh...

I'm like, "Ah, don't go!"

[imitating Genevieve]: I can keep the accent so you'll barely notice she's gone.

[chuckles awkwardly]

Prince Henry, pet me corgi.

Wow.

Um, Ed, have you met our vice principal?

Jessica Day. I'm a big fan of your work and by your work, I mean the child you created.

Not to suggest that it was work making her.

I'm sure it was fun.

I mean... I hope it was fun.

Ed, if you're gonna ask me sex advice, please buy me a glass of wine first.

[Jess chuckles]

[clears throat]

Anyway, switching gears.

I'd love to discuss the, uh, principal vacancy.

As would I.

N-not now. Now's not a great time.

I have, um, uh...

Goodbye.

You beefed it, love.

You beefed it hard.

[blender whirring]

Is that the Vitalstir 3,000 from my registry?

Oh, no, I've had...

I've had this forever.

It came out last year.

Did it?

I've had it for a year.

No, I'm just doing what I always do.

Nicky Miller makin', uh, his famous guacamole.

Like I always do.

Nick Miller's famous guacamole.

[blender whirring]

See ya later.

I'll call you when it's done!

Fine.

[blender stops]

It's from your registry.

I bought it, I brought it home but I can't give it to you.

I am freaking out about what to get you.

Well, Nick why don't you just give us this blender that's on the list of stuff that I want?

Because I feel trapped by this registry.

It's a list made by robots.

Nick, not everything is robots!

Winston puts one walkie-talkie into a mailbox...

Robotic voice: Thank you for your letter.

Yum!

[laughing quietly]

I just... you guys are like my family.

I want to get you something great.

Something unique, personal.

Oh, Nick.

And while you clearly don't understand what a registry is...

[sighs]

I appreciate the sentiment.

Nick...

I don't say this lightly...

I release you from the registry.

Great.

Buy us a gift of your choosing.

What-what I want to get you.

Whatever you want.

The world is yours.

Fly, my little hummingbird.

'Cause I can get you anything.

Oh... this was a double-edged coin.

Winston: Excuse me?

Can you tell me where I can find my son's cubby?

Winston! What are you doing here?

And before you answer that question, get out of here!

Winston? Can't you read?

You said I couldn't do it, but I did it.

I am deep undercover right now.

No one's gonna believe you're a parent here.

Ed: Jimmy-dubs!

Where'd you go?

I needed a refill on the java, E-dawg.

[chuckles]

Jess: Oh, my goodness!

I see you've already met and also, already have '90s hip-hop nicknames for each other.

Genevieve, this is James Wonder.

Hey.

A potential new dad.

He's a landscape architect.

Oh....

And father of Asher.

And husband of?

I... I'm a widower.

Oh, oh...

Yeah. Yeah, she, um... she got squished.

Squished?

Mm-hmm.

Did she? Did she?

Okay, James. Uh, let's leave now so I can show you the school's landscaping.

Ed: Wait, actually, I have a stubborn back yard.

Uh, I don't want to bring in frogs, but if I could attract frogs...

Very common situation in our business.

You need a well.

A well?

Oh. Well, you need to let me buy you a bottle of wine and pick your brain about all this.

[laughs]

That sounds good, E-dawg. We should...

But... but right now, I should get going.

Yeah.

I got a butt load of koi fish in the back of my truck that need bonding.

Please, let me show you out.

Take my hand. Oh, God. Did I say breast?

I meant... I meant hand.

Jess: Uh, hey. Hey, Ed.

I'd love to circle back around to that principal conversation.

Let me just stop you there, Miss Day.

Um, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think I speak for every parent at Banyon Canyon when I say, you're just not a good fit.

Wh-what? I am a perfect fit.

I have my reasons. [chuckles]

Excuse me, I have, uh...

[smacks lips]

Good-bye.

I'm making this for Genevieve. I'm...

I gotta convince her to make my case to Ed.

My man, Ed.

Listen Jess, I could go ahead and give him a call if you like.

All you have to do is say the word.

No, no, no, no. This is no country for James Wonder.

I'm not having you go undercover at school again.

No offense, but you kind of fell out of your dress when Genevieve came on to you.

I did get rattled. I have a girlfriend, and I adore Ally.

But everything else I'm doing seems to be working because Ed loves me.

You know, he wants James to landscape his yard.

So I drew him four sketches.

Wow. Winston, these are actually really good.

I don't remember drawing these.

I woke up this morning, and they were under my pillow.

[groans]

Hey, Nick...

Would you be interested in rubble from old Yankee Stadium?

What, for my rubble collection?

I'm having a really hard time finding something for you.

I thought I was just gonna go on the Internet, but the Internet is so different now.

Have you been on the Internet lately?

How drunk are you?

I remember when the Internet used to just be a naked lady and a bunch of dancing hamsters.

How drunk are you, Nick?

I literally haven't had one thing to drink.

How many drinks have you had?

Give me a breathalyzer.

It feels like you're drunk.

Z-Y-X-N-L-P-A.

You're hammered.

I'm drunk.

Nick, whatever you get us, we're going to love.

It... it doesn't matter.

I don't know what to get you, and it matters, it matters!

It doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter!

Just get us something!

[shouting]: There's a registry.

You go on it, and you pick something!

Now you've got Schmidt all cranked up.

You're cranked up?

Yeah, I got to go to the arcade now and blow off steam!

I didn't mean to crank you up.


Hey, Cece.

Hey, hey.

I don't know what to do.

I want to get you something great, but I can't find anything on the Internet.

Here's the truth. I'd give you my heart.

I'd rip it out of my chest but... but then I would literally die.

But you know that, you're studying to be a nurse.

No, I'm not.

You're already a nurse?

Not a nurse.

But you went to college didn't you?

Why didn't you just give us the Vitalstir?

Because then it would just end up in a landfill in a year when they come out with a Vitalstir 3001.

Well, I imagine they'd go to 4000.

Do you think that they have made 3,000 different Vitalstir models?

Do you really think they've perfected this blender in four tries?

You're not a nurse. [laughs]

Look, I know what you're struggling with right now, okay?

You want to get us something that's unique.

It's got to be great. It's got to be from me to you.

Alright, here's a little exercise... close your eyes.

Now, first thing that comes to your mind.

Imagine something that is unique, it's permanent.

I got it!

Okay, you got to open your eyes before you go, you drunk.

Let me give you the, uh, keys so you can close up.

Oh, no. I put two hands in at the same time again.

[straining]

I did it again.

I can't find this James Wonder anywhere.

I just wanted to say hi, and I want to send him a password-protected video I thought he might enjoy.

Well, I just brought you a little gift.

I know what you're doing. Jess, I have told you I can't afford to get involved in school politics.

Please, Genevieve. I'm begging you.

There's no delicate way to say this so I'm going to be... incredibly cruel.

They don't like you.

At all.

Ow.

They despise you.

All right. I got it.

"Get rid of Jess."

Yikes.

These aren't my words, Jess.

I'm just repeating what I'm hearing.

"Jess is the worst."

Okay.

"Can't stand the sight of her."

Don't need all of it.

Do you understand what I am saying?

Yeah.

They've asked me to move on with my search.

Wait a minute.

Huh?

Would you talk me up to Ed if I could tell you where he was having dinner?

With James Wonder?

Winston.

You need to say the words, Jess.

I need your help.

I need your help, who?

I need your help, James Wonder.

Well, then, my help you shall have.

What'd he say? Is he going to help?

Here is your mission.

You're going too down to Brickfield and you're going to facilitate a conversation about me... with Ed...

My man.

... and Genevieve.

I'm out.

Please, Winst...

James Wonder.

She wants to have sex with me.

I know you love Ally, but James Wonder is still grieving.

Lean into the character.

This is your chance to prove that you can do undercover work.

Please?

All right, I'll do it. Under one condition.

That I...

No, I don't have any conditions.

Okay.

I design all the landscaping, and my crew... my crew, they do all the dirty work.

If you were my boss I would be employee of the month every single day.

Winston [over phone speaker]: All right then.

Oh, jeez, Genevieve, stop flirting, get to me!

Are you shouting at a podcast again, Jess?

You know it can't hear you, right?

Shh!

Speaking of bosses, Ms. Day has done some amazing work.

Strong disagree.

Uh, what is your ish with her?

She sets our kids up for failure.

What?!

Ed: This ridiculous... math decathlon... ugh!

It is competitive and demeaning.

It is hard enough out there for these kids.

Affluent children in Los Angeles do have it hard.

Exactly.

Samanthia b*mb that dumb thing, never got a medal, and now she's lost her appetite for soosh!

That's what he's mad at?

My version of the demathlon is way less rigorous than the South Korean teacher I copied it from.

Either bring the phone over here where we can hear it, or stop talking to it.

He's saying that unless I drop the demathlon, I'll never be principal.

Genevieve: James.

I am trouble after two glasses.

So why don't you pour me a third?

[laughing heartily]

[nervous chuckle]

Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

Okay. Mm-hmm. O-okay.

Do it. Do it!

Okay. Okay.

[laughing]

Stop it! Stop it!

I'm going to get crazy.

You're making me crazy.

I did it.

Best present ever.

Please. I'm trying to eavesdrop on Winston's alter ego.

[chuckling] Oh...

Genevieve: James.

Hmm?

You seem troubled.

No, I don't.

You must be holding a lot of sadness in your legs.

I have hands like a bonobo... strong.

Oh, wow. [nervous chuckle]

There we go.

Ooh. Very good.

Aah!

Ow! Now, no! I have a girlfriend.

Her name is Ally.

No. No. No. No. No.

Wasn't your wife recently squished?

Yeah. That-that happened.

She was indeed...

But then, we cremated her.

And we, we, we had to dry her out first.

Ugh. He's scrambling like a damn egg!

I got to get in there.

Wait, you got to see my gift!

Who are you, James Wonder?

[chuckles]

I'm just a... a combination of my two favorite singers.

I'm about to gift your brains to pieces.

You got to real pull-the-rip-cord-while-still-in-the-plane kind of vibe, Nick.

It's a little something from me... to you.

All right.

Or, more accurately, on me.

[laughing] Check it out.

I got the best gift.

It is your faces, but it's not your bodies.

I didn't have a full body sh*t so...

Wow!

.. they picked the bodies.

Schmidt: Is that Pretty Woman?

This is from the movie Pretty Woman and it's on me forever.

[laughs]

Say something.

[nervous chuckle]

Say something.

It-it's cute, it's really cute.

I really did it.

Talk to me about how happy you are.

It's on me forever.

Schmidt: I know we're on you forever and ever, until you're buried in a non-Jewish cemetery.

Cece: And now we-we owe you a... a thank you card.

Just don't know where I'm gonna find the words to express all of the emotions that I'm feeling right now.

[laughs]

I can't find anything about you online, James.

Not even the darknet.

Oh, I was gonna say, you checked the darknet, yeah?

I'm usually on there, they usually got some stuff about me.

Hey!

Winston: Oh, thank God. Jess... ica Day.

I can't believe you guys are all at my favorite restaurant.

Hey, does anyone have a red landscaping truck?

'Cause it's getting towed.

Anyone? Red landscaping truck?

No, mine's white.

[clears throat]

Well, it could be white.

It's getting towed.

I-I did take the red one today.

Yeah, can't let that get towed.

My crew is napping in the back.

Yup.

Well...

[chuckling]: Hey.

This is an unexpected treat.

Well, I'm happy to have ran into you because, um...

I've been thinking, and...

I'm canceling the demathlon.

Really?

Yeah.

But I thought you loved the math decathlon?

It's a holdover from my old public school days.

It's unnecessarily competitive.

Old habits die hard.

That's true, you know, I still eat a ton of meat and I've been vegetarian for years.

Like, a ton.

A ton of meat.

I mean, I didn't realize you were so amenable.

Hey, actually, Samanthia loves puppets.

What would you say if I asked you to introduce ventriloquism into the curriculum?

And do less math?

I'd say...

[in puppet voice]: You got it!

[clears throat]

Great.

[both chuckle]

"Sincerely"?

"Sincerely"?

"Dear Nick, thanks for the tattoo.

"Sincerely, S and Cece."

You guys hate my gift?

No, we don't hate it, we love it, I see it every time I blink.

You guys want to see it?

It's okay.

Ah, I'll show it anyhow.

Check it out. There's an ingrown hair that gives Cece a bit of a Rudolph nose.

And when I flex my feet it makes you guys fatter. Look.

Fat, look how fat your face looks, Schmidt.

[laughs] You have the fattest face in the world.

All right, stop it! Stop the horror!

We hate the gift.

It's disgusting.

It is disgusting.

You've ruined your leg.

It is like you stole our souls.

You depicted my wife as a common street whore.

Fine, you don't want it?

You can't have it.

I'll get it removed and we can go about our lives again in a week.

You know it costs, like, two grand and takes a year or something, right?

Well, I did not know that.

Okay?

I didn't know that.

Well, that really sucks for me.

But fine, then that's your present.

That's not a present. Look Nick, I appreciate you trying to do something meaningful for us, but just give us the blender you bought.

Well, the jokes on you, I burnt out the motor making a bubble gum smoothie.

You're back on the registry then.

I won't do it! It's a list made by robots.

Idiot! Trying to get me something meaningful!

The only thing meaningful to me is the blender!

Remember to bring your pets to school next week for human zoo day.

Yeah.

Oh, and I'd also like to let everyone know that we are switching back from this soap to this soap, okay?

So just be aware.

Next, I would like to offer my personal endorsement of Jessica Day as our next principal.

[applause]

All right, well, first, I'd love to open up the floor to questions. Anybody?

Oh, wow, okay.

Can you get rid of the white lines in the parking lot?

They're very restrictive.

I think they're for...

Man 2: Shouldn't we designate the green space for European-style football?

Woman: And for Tofu Tuesday, can we get a more balanced juice pairing?

Didn't think I'd ever see you again.

I came to say goodbye.

Asher and I are moving to Colorado.

Is that where Ally lives?

No.

The city of Denver wants me to landscape an entire mountain.

It's a whole thing.

Man 1: How about once a week in the dining hall we serve sushi omakase?

Oh, oh, okay.

Ed: Guys, uh, plenty of time to run our suggestions by her.

But I assure you she will be very amenable.

She is a principal for the parents.

Hmm?

Uh, actually, um, no.

I-I have to be honest here.

I...

That's not who I am.

I'm not gonna be a principal for the parents.

[parents murmur]

I'm gonna be a principal for the kids.

Look, you all love your kids and they're yours to raise, but I'm an educator and I know how to educate.

Colby, your son Vince had the handwriting of a Hungarian doctor.

Mm-hmm.

And that's why I encouraged him to sign up for calligraphy comics after school.

He didn't want to do it, but look at him now.

I can finally read the captions for his disturbing images.

And Molly, do you remember how terrified Beatrice was of public speaking in the second grade?

That's why I bumped her up to fourth grade debate team.

Yeah, she made a toast at my brother's wedding.

I mean, besides one r*cist joke, she k*lled.

Ed, when I met Samanthia, math was her least favorite subject.

Now she's doing fractions and loving it.

And yeah, she's didn't win a demathlon medal and I know that stung, but it made her want to get better.

And isn't that what school is for?

Look, I think challenging your children prepares them for the real world.

And if given the chance, I think I can help your kids and this school reach its full potential.

And if that's not what you want, and I'm not the right fit, then I can live with that.

There it is!

Aah!

Thanksgiving!

It is 7:00 A.M.

I've actually been up for two hours.

Let's do this! Perfect Thanksgiving!

Reagan's coming today, and I want everything to be great for the guest of honor.

Oh, the... the guest of honor?

Yeah, the guest of honor.

I guess my dad spending Thanksgiving with me for the first time ever is a non-event.

Ooh. Is he bringing his new squoosh?

Hmm?

Is that a thing people say?

No.

Uh-uh.

Well, his squoosh has a name, and it's Ann Kim.

She's probably gonna want to spend some time with you ladies, too, because you know how fathers and sons can be on Thanksgiving.

Drinking beer, watching the game, hugging each other in a way that suggests, "I forgive you for every... for everything."

Okay, look, I know you're excited, but maybe don't put so much pressure on it, you know?

I mean, we all... we all know who your dad is.

Who he was. Who he was, though.

Just don't expect too much.

Just be happy that he's coming at all.

So what time's Robby coming?

He's not coming.

He is going to visit his folks.

What's your guys' deal now?

Are you actually together, or are you just nursing him back to health 'cause you broke his entire body and face?

We are not together, but I don't think Robby understands that.

I wonder why, Jess.

You only hang out with him 24/7.

I know. You're right.

I'll do it next time I see him. I'm just dreading it.

He's such a good egg.

I mean, with his dad khakis and his glasses and his... his... his sweet little change purse.

You know what? That's it. He's too nice.

There's just no oomph.

Yeah. It's non-negotiable. You got to have the oomph.

Yeah, oomph was all Cece and I had when we started oomphing.

Oh, "oomph" is sex.

Why say that stupid word? Just say "sex."

Oh, because it's more than that, Nick.

It's f*re. It's passion.

It's ha-cha-cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.

Mm.

Jess: And there's no ha-cha-cha with Robby. He's too nice.

Winston: Well, look, Jess, do what you got to, but I love that guy.

Schmidt: Winston, you sprained your ankle running for a bagel.

Yeah. I was at work, though.

Running for a bagel.

What is his name again? Is it Rick Snip?

Did you drop the hammer?

I have not dropped the hammer.

Snoopy! Saw Snoopy.

Okay, no. You-you got to end this.

Robby: False alarm. It's just John Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.

Drop the hammer now?

He can't even tell the difference between John Stamos and Snoopy.

You can't break a man's heart on a holiday.

I'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain... it comes back year after year after year.

You don't want to do that to him, I'm telling you.

That's why I'm always a hot mess on take-your-daughter-to-work day.

Robby: Uh-oh. It's the senior citizens choir.

Get the tissues!

Winston: Look, I'll tell you what, Jess.

I'll keep him busy for the day.

You can destroy him tomorrow.

Thank you, Winston.

You know what? Next take-your-daughter-to-work-day is gonna be take-Winston-out- for-spaghetti day.

I would enjoy that for real.

Ooh, it's my daddy!

I hope you're ready, 'cause I have a full day planned for us.

First up is a game of American football featuring the Cowboys of Dallas.

I'm sorry.

It's our first Thanksgiving together.

Look, I've been crying all morning, too.

It's... this is a good thing.

Ann Kim broke up with me.

Oh, no.

Excuse me.

Da...

Jess: Gavin!

Happy Thanksgiving.

Nick: Hey, Gavin.

It just got a whole lot happier.

Excuse me.

Daddy?

You remember when you tongue-kissed that guy?

Man [on TV]: Now this marching band has traveled 1,500 miles...

What you taking? Little boy blues?

Yeah, I've been there.

How many miggies you working with?

Yeah, my pharmacist bumped me up to nine.

1,400. Yeah. I have to take 18 pills an hour in a very specific order, and they virtually assured me that I will be addicted to them.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey, what happened to Rick Snip?

Uh, gone and, uh... [sniffles, sighs] these tears... honestly, they're from the onions.

They're not from Reagan bailing.

Oh, no. Reagan's not coming?

No. She just called. Uh, her boss sent her to Omaha, so she can't make it, but it's fine.

Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

I also wear a slow-release opium patch on my spine.

[laughs]

Hey, I ever told you the story of how I got injured in the first place?

Yes.

One may think that it started because of a lack of bagels, but no.

It started with a surplus... of cream cheese.

Of cream cheese.

Yes, yes, you're familiar with such happening.

You know what? I think Jess told me to help her...

No, no, no, no. You're good.

Uh, lock you up. [laughs]

I'm sure she's bummed, too.

How long is she gonna be there?

No idea. I didn't ask.

I just said, "Happy Thanksgiving."

[sizzling]

[whooshing]

And then I hung up.

Okay, you're gonna have to leave the kitchen.

The whole sad-guy, whiskey-flame combination is starting to worry me.

Let me know when my whiskey boils down to a crystal so I can eat it.

Hey, Dad, are you okay in there?

Did you fall in?

That's a dad joke that I would've assumed I would have heard you make had you been around more.

Gavin: I want you to know I'm not using the bathroom.

I'm just sitting here.

Hey, Dad, you know what's a great cure for heartache?

A little father-and-son time.

You know, we could have a catch, whittle a stick.

Why don't you just come out?

I'm sorry, son. You're right.

Today is about family.

Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly.

There's my favorite whiskey glass.

Aah. Who wants to get wasted?

Me. So badly.

Ugh. I'm so sorry, babe.

Yeah. No. I'm-I'm fine.

Look, we don't wear sweaters and roll around in the leaves, but there are other ways for us to bond.

If he wants to drink, then, you know what? I'm gonna drink.

I'm gonna get sloppy with my poppy.

Nick. Papa! Wait for me.

Just need to get my bitters kit.

Ooh, actually, can you just make sure that there's a garbage can next to the bed?

Because... I can't hang.

[television playing nearby]

Robby!

What are you doing here with me and not with Winston?

I like Winston, but he's been telling this bagel story for ten minutes.

I haven't even met all the main characters yet.

Plus, I have a little surprise for you.

To make up for this morning, the airline gave me two free tickets to anywhere in the contiguous 48 states.

Oh. Ha.

Well, I'd love to, you know, plan our future, but we're eating in under four hours, and so I have to put you to work.

Okay, you just, crouton.

Oh.

All right. Keep croutonning.

Okay, I'm not that close to the table.

[clank] Darn it.

I was just in the bathroom...

Robby: Nothing but net. with my husband and his father.

Are you also having a good Thanksgiving?

Hey, Jess. Check this out.

Did that go in?

Robby got plane tickets, Swish. and he wants to whisk my away, Nothing but bowl. once he gets better, which could be months from now.

Jess, I'm looking up some hotels right now.

Twin bed's okay, right?

Hammer time?

Hammer time.

Cheers.

Yes, sir.

Ah. This is the dream.

A boy, his dad, his best friend sharing a drink.

Don't tell Mom, right?

[laughing]: I'm just kidding.

I know you and Mom haven't spoken in 30 years, including my wedding.

You know what's stupid?

There's a part of me that actually thought I might have a wedding with Ann Kim someday.

I don't think that's stupid at all, Dad.

I think that's beautiful.

You know, you opened up your heart to Ann Kim and that's brave.

Maybe she was just scared.

You know women. They're a mystery.

Yeah, sometimes they just go to Omaha and you don't know when they're gonna come back.

Or if they're coming back.

How do you even know she's in Omaha?

Oh, because, uh, she said she was.

Nothing means anything.

Nothing means anything.

Nothing... means anything.

At least you're young, Nick.

You got a rocking bod with kickass buns.

You're not gonna have any problems.

Who's gonna want an old guy like me?

I've got garbage buns.

What? Are you out of your mind? Dad, you've got fantastic buns.

You think?

I'm telling you, you've got nothing to worry about.

Nick, stand up, put your buns next to each other, so... here.

What is happening here?

I'm not doing anybody any favors today.

I'm a bummer.

Probably the best thing I could do would be to head home.

See you later, man, nice to see you again.

Dad, stay. Look... you're gonna land on your feet.

I've see... I've seen all kinds of women throw themselves at you.

Lifeguards and teachers, lens crafters.

Remember when you had your tongue in Jess' mouth?

She tasted like licorice... sweet but with a bite.

Not... you're not helping, Nick.

Actually, you know what? Can I see you in the hallway, please?

Why?

[groans]


Nick, we have got to go to Ann Kim's house and convince her to give my dad a second chance.

It's the only way he's gonna stay.

She's not gonna come. She's a snake.

All women are snakes.

I understand that you're spinning out about Reagan.

I'm spinning out about Reagan.

I get it. But you have to help me save my Thanksgiving with my dad.

You're right. I'm so sorry.

We can pull this off.

If we get her to take him back...

... We'd be heroes.

That's right.

[both laughing]

Look at that, Mom, I'm gonna be a hero.

Why are you looking up? Your mother is still alive.

I'm looking at Chicago.

You think Chicago is up?

It's north.

Robby, you're a great guy, but nothing is ever gonna happen between us.

However, someday you're gonna open a really wonderful bed and breakfast.

That was pretty good.

I mean, right?

Can you imagine the wine and cheese hour he would put on?

Stuff the toga with hot coals.

We're going out.

What? Wait.

Have a place setting at the table for Ann Kim, but don't seat her next to my dad.

I want all the couples split up.

Everybody gets to talk that way, but, uh... and then put me next to Nick.

Yeah.

And then my dad next to me as well.

So I'm sandwiched between Nick and my dad.

You guys can't leave. We need you here.

Well, I need a happy daddy.

He needs a happy daddy.

If they never come back, the last words I'll have heard my husband say are "happy daddy."

Okay, good luck.

Oh, smells great.

That's just my famous gravy. [chuckles]

The trick is, um, a pinch of brown sugar and then a couple more handfuls of brown sugar.

Actually, uh, just a lot of brown sugar.

Ann Kim loves gravy.

Big dogs, small horses, the smell of rain, and gasoline.

[sobbing]

Oh, Gavin.

You're a handsome and passionate and charismatic man.

You and me.

We really had something.

What do you say we give it another sh*t?

Let's just drive and drive and drive.

I know what I'm not thankful for this year.

This. This is it.

Robby, this is not what it looks...

Don't say anything.

I-I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just start by saying that is smells delicious in here.

I'm gonna leave.

[groans]

Just... hold on a second.

[clattering]

[groans]

Hey, Ann Kim, show your face.

You cold-hearted zombie.

Who's down there?

It's Gavin's son.

I don't know if you remember this, but we went on a double date once.

My wife got terribly ill from some truffle oil.

Rich foods don't agree with her.

Did Gavin send you?

No, no, no. He doesn't even know that I'm here.

Look, Ann Kim, he's heartbroken.

You opened up something inside of him, and you turned him into the man that I always knew that he could be.

And darn it, I'm just a kid... [sighs] hoping for a Thanksgiving miracle.

Why don't you give him a second chance and come back with us, and let's all give thanks together.

Great speech.

Yeah, it really was a great speech, man.

Thanks.

Did you do it with the five other women he's dating?

What?

That's why he always refers to me by my first and last name, because he's dating two Anns.

This is worse than my Reagan thing.

I can't believe that I spent all day feeling sorry for that son of a bitch.

I guess I'm the son of a bitch.

Leave or I'm hitting the sprinklers.

Ann Kim, please, give me a minute to process this.

Sprinklers!

That was not a minute!

Sprinklers!

That was not a minute!

No!

[knocking on door]

Hello, Jessica.

If you're here to hurt Robby, then you're here to hurt me.

And if you hurt me, then I'm gonna hurt Robby.

Wait a minute. No. If you're here...

If you don't get out of your room, I'm gonna bleach all your bird shirts.

Robby, I got to go.

That's a wise choice.

[sighs]

Robby, I need you to know that there is...

[exhales] nothing going on between me and Gavin, except for an icy awkwardness that will continue until one or both of us is d*ad.

Oh, thank God. [laughs]

I mean, I was sitting here thinking, really? Schmidt's dad.

I know. That'd be crazy, right?

Although I totally get it.

I mean... [exhales] he's got that rakish charm.

And that voice. Oh, my God.

Great buns and...

Robby, stop. There's more.

Oh, boy.

I think I know where this is going.

Let me guess.

You see me as more of a friend.

Well, I didn't want to talk about it on Thanksgiving.

But you brought the tickets and...

Jess, it's okay. I get it.

You know, there has to be that, um...

Oomph?

Yeah. I was gonna say "yowza," but, uh, oomph. You can't force the oomph, you know?

I'll take my mom to Phoenix. She's nuts about Phoenix.

Schmidt: Well, congrats, Dad!

Holiday's over! You ruined another Thanksgiving!

I can't believe that you're seeing six women.

What's going on?

How do you run a vineyard?

Not well. I'm seeing six women.

He tried to make it seven.

I caught him making a move on Jess.

Again? Why is my father so sexual?

Why is he asking Chicago?

Good question.

You know what, Gavin, if this is who you really are, then you can forget about Thanksgiving and all the holidays and all the non-holidays.

Pretty much what I'm talking about is every day.

Hey, hey, hey, guys, let's remember the reason for the season.

We're all very thankful.

Gavin: Jess, I am so sorry.

I had no idea you two were together.

I thought you were his physical therapist.

Physical therapist?

Aren't you a physical therapist or something?

You think she's a... Jess is a top-notch vice principal.

[grunts]

Jess: Oh, Robby...

Robby, no. Don't stand.

Your-your knee.

I don't give a flying care about that.

I stand up when I stand up for people.

I think you're getting roid rage.

I didn't take any steroids today, because the TSA took 'em this morning.

Now, what you're seeing is pure, unfiltered Robby, straight from the tap.

Get him, Robby.

You-you tried to make Jess the seventh woman you're dating, and you don't even know the first thing about her.

I mean, did-did you know that when she was six she tried to eat a lightning bug so that her heart would glow like E.T.?

Did you know that she tried to give herself Lyme disease out of solidarity to her fourth grade classmate?

Or-or that she never lets any of her electronics go below 25%, just in case someone else needs to use them?

I mean, did you know... did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?

It's so cute, man.

It would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess...

I'm... I'm...

Oh!

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh.

Thank you. But you don't.

Y-you're just desperate and lonely and you're trying to use her, and I...

Oh, it's happening again.

Oh.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, oh.

Thank you.

You can't use Jess, because she is a dream girl.

Here's the last thing I'll say before I leave.

Jess, I know it's not me, but... [sighs] you deserve somebody who knows how special you are.

Um, I'm going. I'm going.

Don't go, Robby.

I'm not going out. I'm-I'm going down!

Cece: Just...

Okay. It still looks good!

The turkey still looks good.

Wait, what are you...

It is hot! My skin!

It's burning my skin!

The hell you doing?!

It was hot! It was hot!

Now I got to eat a dirty turkey! What's wrong with you?

Gavin: This is all my fault.

You know I throw hot things!

I'm so sorry.

It was fine!

Turkey's expensive!

Any more?

This isn't on me!

Furguson don't eat turkey from the ground!

Nick: Oh, no. I'm not taking the fall for this one.

It's all on you!

I'm not taking the...

Hey! Can we not yell at each other on Thanksgiving?!

I recognize that I, too, am yelling.

And I'm-I'm sorry, Robby.

Great, he's gone.

[sighs] I was just starting to feel it.

Go.

Yeah, Jess, go.

Go.

Go!

Go after him.

Save us some floor turkey.

Hey.

Look, I know you had high hopes for Thanksgiving with your dad.

You called it.

The guy is who he is.

You know, maybe you just need to drop this idea that he'll ever be the bigger man.

I think that needs to be you, babe.

You're the bigger man.

Son, I know you're probably tired of hearing both these statements and not likely to believe either, but...

I'm leaving and I'm sorry.

Dad, I said... I said a lot of things earlier.

I don't want you out of my life.

I was waiting for you to be someone who you're not, but...

I know who you are and I still love you.

But you-you need to listen to me, son to father, get a therapist.

Oh, I have a therapist.

A better one.

Okay.

And I shouldn't have to say this but one that you're not sleeping with.

Okay.

Wait! Robby! Robby, don't go.

I tried to Irish good-bye, but, uh, I'm moving a little slow.

When you were in there and you were saying all those things, I realize I don't even really know you.

And I want to get to know you.

Jess, it's okay. I-I don't want you to force something that's not there.

I felt it.

You felt the oomph?

Yes. I... [sighs]

I'm sorry I'm being so confusing.

All I said was that the ladies' bathroom needs more toilet paper.

And I want you to implement that... as manager.

All right.

Cece, this could be your whole future. What do you say?

"Whole future" makes it seem like I'm gonna grow old and die there, which is terrifying.

Oh, yeah, but... yeah...

Scarf looks fine, Schmidt.

Now the blend is several degrees from seamless, a... as you can see.

I've gained six pounds, maybe six and a half, I'm sure of it.

Honey, you look exactly the same to me.

Are you implying you gained six pounds in your neck?

I used to crush at the gym and now I'm just mediocre, like early Beyoncé.

Nobody will say it, but you know it's true.

Look, you're just shaking the rust off.

You got to run the faucet till the brown runs out.

Speaking of which, I have to do the same.

Don't wait up. [chuckles]

Hey, squats, good news.

I'm dating again.

No, thank you.

Never mind.

Okay.

What the hell? I used to be so good at dating.

I don't think you were.

I had a thing a certain type responded to.

Hey, Jess. Hey, Schmidt.

Hey.

Robby, you go to this gym?

Oh, yeah. Jess and I work out all the time.

In fact, everyone from our singles group works out here, too.

Jess, who am I right now? [groans]

Tony!

Tony. That's right. Tony.

[laughs]

[Robby and Jess laughing]

All right. I'm gonna get a drink and get back to my workout, but, uh, you better be careful.

My... I-I tore every single ligament in my right leg.

The doctor says I have to focus [inhales sharply] on the top until it heals.

Yeah, classic genie workout.

Just let your legs waste away until they turn into mist.

Guess you got to lift weights like Tony sleeps.

Robby: No bottoms.

Jess: No bottoms.

[Robby and Jess laughing]

We love Tony.

All right.

Check you later.

[chuckles]

All right, got to get back on the horse.

Got to find a guy I can have some rhythm with.

Ooh. Sweaty guy?

Oh. Guy doing Pilates in work boots?

Are you doing a bit right now?

What?

Just date Robby.

Oh, Schmidt, not this again.

Why not? I mean, you guys get along.

He's clearly into you. You have that whole Tony thing, which was very inside and alienating.

Well, I do find Robby really funny and... he's as tall as you can be before it's weird.

See, I'd put him on the wrong side of that line, but that's just me. Who cares what I think?

Jess... go get him.

Oh. It's a colon drop?

Uh, I didn't order this.

Is it just me or is it colon here?

[laughs]

Yeah.

Hi, there.

Hey, the birds on your shirt look a little lonely.

Maybe they could use some company?

Nah.

They find it very fulfilling to play amongst themselves.

Find me if they change their mind.

Was she hitting on us?

Hey, what can give you?

I guess I'll get some calamari and some soup.

What's the soup of the day?

Actually, what I'm talking about? This is my bar. Who are you?

Oh, Nick, this is Donovan, the new bartender I hired.

Hey.

Hey, Donovan.

Yeah, nice to meet you.

Uh, would you mind grabbing a-an extra keg?

Got it.

That's an interesting hire.

You-you see, bartenders are mostly, I don't know, grizzled guys, you know, with character or they're hot women who bring in grizzled guys with character.

I know. He's actually an aspiring model and I figure he'll bring in more women.

How would he bring in more women?

Because he is super hot.

That guy is super hot?

Yes.

Okay, if you say so.

I don't say so.

The Lord says so. That boy is off the charts.

I wouldn't know.

Okay, don't be that guy.

I'm not being that guy. I don't see it.

Don't be the, "Eh, I wouldn't know" guy.

It's a bad color on you.

No, I'm not saying it's a color.

I'm not even making... like... I don't see that he's more handsome.

I have been getting all kinds of female attention lately.

Did I suddenly get more attractive?

How should I know?! I don't see that kind of thing.

I'm just trying to write.

Babe.

Yeah, babe.

Babe.

Yes, babe?

You have a girlfriend now, which means you've got a lot of confidence and women love that.

Now, if you'll just keep making it clear that you have a girlfriend, it'll pass.

I hate shutting women down all damn night.

I want to be a source of light in the world.

Well...

That's why I always sit at the table with the little kids first.

[both laughing]

Man, that restaurant was so weird.

I feel like we were the only people not celebrating a birthday.

Well, it-it was called Birthdays.

♪ Birthday, birthday, birthday ♪

How's the chicken?

Sorry, what?

[people singing loudly]

How-how's your chicken?

What?

I was just saying, "How is your chicken?"

Oh, yeah. I have chicken.

Yes. Yeah.

I-I know you have it, but how...

I ordered the chicken.

What?

I ordered the chicken!

Right, right, right. Is it good, though?

It was a loud, horrible restaurant. [chuckles]

Sorry.

So why did I have so much fun?

Probably the company.

Yeah, I guess so. [chuckles]

Ow. What?

Sorry. [chuckles]

It's okay. I guess.

Well, night, pal.

Oh.

Be well.

Okay. Uh...

Jess, why are you not dressed for the gymnasia?

Hmm. I'm not going.

Why the hell not?

Oh, is it your birthday?

No. I just...

Did we forget your birthday? This is terrible.

It's not my birthday.

It's a big one, too, isn't it?

How old do you think I...

No, I'm eating leftovers from my date with Robby.

Did you go to Birthdays?

You know, if you get a chance, you should try the Birthdays Express at the airport.

I like it better. It's del...

Anyway, how was your date?

It was great and then it was disastrous.

Oh, so you had sex with him?

No.

The opposite.

The opposite?

So, you gave birth to him?

No. It was going really well.

It was fun and then at the end, he clearly wanted to kiss and I thought I did, too, and then... instead I just gave him the old Pittsburgh good-bye.

Chuck on the arm and a handshake?

Why would you do that?

Because, I...

[sighs]

In that moment, I just couldn't see myself spending the rest of my life with him.

80 years old, feeding him pea soup out of a tin cup.

I'm confused. Is this a happy ending for Jess Day?

I mean, where are you living at this point, under a bridge?

I see you and Cece and Nick and Reagan and Winston and Furguson...

Aly.

Sorry, that just came out. Winston and Aly.

And you're all in love, and I just... don't know if I'll ever have that magic with Robby.

See, this just proves my theory that if you were a man, you would have a very difficult time getting an erection.

You have a theory about that?

You're putting way too much pressure on yourself.

It's a date, it's not the rest of your life.

You had a good time, right?

Well, yeah, it was Robby.

He's the funniest guy in the world.

So lighten up. If you want to kiss him, kiss him.

Who knows... maybe you'll see if you have magic then.

You know what? You're right.

I was gonna try to avoid Robby, but funk that chicken!

I'm gonna go get my gym clothes on!

Yeah.

I'm gonna put my push-up bra on.

That's actually not a bra that pushes my breasts up, it's actually one that I do push-ups in.

I get it.

Smash these babies down.

Let's do it.

Ooh, no, Cece, you know it's not Jess' birthday, right?

Put that away.

Yeah, no, I know that.

Um, this gift is for you.

What?

Mm-hmm.

Cece... It's a scarf.

Yeah. [chuckles]

I love it.

Almost makes me want to go to Buffalo for work.

Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

Look at... look at that.

Oh, no.

O-oh, no. Oh, no!

How long does she think my freakin' neck is?

It's a fat-man scarf.

My wife gave me a fat-man scarf!

I did a few freelance modeling gigs.

I was the "wowee face" for an amusement park ad.

[chuckles]: That's actually really great.

Oh, that was you.

We really gotta get you working.

Let me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.

Do some model looks.

All right.

Um, this one I call, "I just saw something patriotic."

All right...

It was an eagle.

I was gonna say eagle.

I want to show some range.

Show me "I just saw something unpatriotic."

How you gonna pull that off?

Oh.

That's some rich gravy, man.

I noticed you from across the way.

Can I buy you a drink?

I'm sorry, but let me be very clear.

I have a girlfriend., and I am very much so devoted to her.

Aw.

Here's my number. Use it.

She didn't listen to a word...

Throw a peanut out of frustration!

Okay, why are you even here?

I thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.

I would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.

This is insane... you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.

I do... How would I know?

Nick, please, that dude is hot as hell, man.

He is a member of the Hall of Fine.

He's more attractive than Joe Mangaroni.

Manga... Joe Menden...

Who are you thinking of?

Magic Mike's friend.

Oh, he's married to that...

Yeah, J Lo.

Joe Mangallini.

Joe Mangallini.

He's more attractive than Joe Mangallini.

Okay, I know for a fact... that this was the most attractive man in America for ten years.

I know that because magazines told me so.

But...

Okay...


Hey, Donovan, could you copy that?

You guys don't look anything alike.

Okay.

Okay.

Are you planning on speeding up at any point?

Oh, my God, Schmidt, are you walking on a decline?

This is what we call a "trudge," Jess.

My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?

[imitating police siren]

Uh, license and registration, please.

[laughing]

I had a great time last night, you know?

And thank you for taking that cake off my hands.

I would have eaten it for breakfast.

Huh, gross, right?

[chuckles]

Better get back to my uppers.

By the time this knee is fixed, I'm gonna look like the WB frog, you know?

[imitating WB frog]: ♪ Ba da bup a duh breeer. ♪

[laughs]

[chuckling]

That guy...

You're the only two people in here that enjoyed that.

Please go after him.

Hey, need a spot?

Yeah, yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

Hey, Jess, about last night, at the end there, I hope I wasn't...

No, you weren't, and I hope you didn't think that...

I just kinda thought that we were in synch, you know?

But then...

No, Robby...

I wanted to kiss you, too.

You did?

Oh...

Oh, well, Jess, I don't know if this is...

Oh, okay.

[both crying out]

[alarmed chatter]

Somebody call an ambulance.

Robby, are you okay?

I don't know, Robby hurt his mouth pretty bad here.

It hurts a lot. It felt good first, but then it hurts a lot now.

Jess: Just so you know, this is all your fault.

Oh, that's fair.

I should have made it very clear to you not to kiss Robby while he was balancing a dangerous amount of weight above his head.

There was a moment before the bar came down where we were just two people kissing, and... nothing.

No magic.

Look, at least now you know.

No harm done, right?

A tremendous amount of harm done.

Now I have to tell a man I maimed that I'm not interested.

On the bright side, you're not that hurt.

Come to think of it, how are you not more hurt?

When I was in triage, they said that my neck muscles had served as kind of a neck helmet, which made me feel like I was not talking to real doctors.

Anyway, I just have to wear this thing for the next few days just as a precaution.

Well, if you want to cover it up, Cece gave me a scarf that's perfect.

It's long enough to wrap around an above-ground pool filled with Alfredo sauce.

Alfredo sauce. Doesn't that sound good?

Not really.

I don't know.

Maybe Cece's right.

Maybe I am turning into a fat man.

Cece never called you fat.

Well, I am.

I'm a fat man married to a hot woman.

Cool, I'm a sitcom.

That sounds like a great show.

Throw in a wacky neighbor, I'm watching.

Maybe the reason why you don't want to go to the gym is 'cause you want to hang out with your beautiful wife.

Right?

And you're fat and happy because you're happy.

You're right.

I'm a lucky man.

A Lucky Man should be the name of your show.

You're a beleaguered casino owner, and a father of three.

Man: Ms. Day?

Yes?

Mr. McFerrin's regained consciousness.

Oh, thank goodness.

You can see him now.

Thank you. All right.

Robby's full name is Robby McFerrin?

Hey.

Hey.

I met with that photographer you sent me to. It went great.

I mean, he even gave me a free bottle of water.

Ooh.

I felt like a movie star.

[chuckles]

He wants to work together.

That's amazing.

I got these release forms to sign.

You want me to take a look at them for you?

Yeah.

Okay. There we go. [clears throat]

Donovan, these terms are unacceptable.

He's really screwing you.

Aww...

You know what?

I'm gonna get on the phone with him, because if we start treating our attractive people like this, our society is gonna collapse.

[sighs] Hey, man, you busy writing?

What does it look like?

Want a rain-stick?

Some girl gave it to me.

You know, I'm getting a lot of gifts from women who want to sleep with me lately.

You know? It's hopeless, man.

I'm so damn confident.

Winston, I was really hoping to make headway on this, but uh, we got to put out this f*re, don't we?

It's hot.

Hmm.

You're too confident.

Too confident ain't the word.

I'm at a whole new level.

Do you remember when you were taking the bus to the farmer's market and it h*t a bump and you soiled yourself?

That was not my favorite Arbor Day. [laughs]

Why you, uh... why are you bringing that up?

Remember when you, uh, were in the park, and a bee flew into your mouth and then you fell off the bridge at that place where all the ducks go to the bathroom?

I see what you're doing. Keep it going.

Remember when you had to leave Latvia because you weren't good enough to be a professional basketball player, and you came back home to be a full time babysitter?

Okay. All right. Time out.

You know, you, you h*t a nerve.

Okay.

Definitely brought me down a peg.

I'm sorry.

It's okay. I needed it.

Okay.

Okay.

I feel some less confident now.

My man. [laughs]

[laughing]: All right, then.

All right. Back to my novel.

[upbeat song playing on radio]

You're still on that?

I can't figure it out.

Look. Imagine a world where you woke up one morning and instead of your face, you had Donovan's face.

Whoa.

And instead of your body, you had his.

How would you feel?

If I had his face and his body?

Oh-hoo, yeah.

I'd feel fantastic.

And that's... how you know he's attractive.

Hmm.

Hmm.

Can I have a minute with this, please?

Oh, sure thing.

Can I interest you in some white noise?

Yes, please.

[shakes rain-stick contents]

[contents falling like rain]

Hmm.

[contents falling]

So, when a man looks like a man that you wouldn't mind looking like, that's a way to assess a man's attractiveness.

Exactly.

Oh!

Cece: That's right.

You are gonna draw up a brand new agreement for Donovan to sign.

Hell, yeah, you're gonna have a courier bring it over to me right now.

And, uh, listen closely, Marco, Donovan subsection H is a deal breaker, so, rip it out of the agreement and burn it.

Or we're walking.

Look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, bye.

That was amazing.

Yeah.

That was amazing.

And I know that because I wouldn't mind having their faces.

And I wouldn't mind having their bodies.

Okay.

Yeah, Schmidt named their house Jaipur Aviv to celebrate the union of India and Israel that their marriage represents.

This place is way too big for three people.

What about your dream of having an in-loft multipurpose room?

Multipurpose rooms can't pay rent.

That's the only purpose they don't serve.

So let's get a roommate.

Well, Cece and Schmidt'll be here another six months, so we have time to find someone we like.

Someone... who's a girl.

What do you think about Reagan as our roommate?

'Cause she would live in my room, but she'd still pay rent.

And then you could have that multipurpose room where you could shower and cook.

Well, I'd still use the bathroom and the kitchen for showering and cooking, but I would use the multipurpose room for everything else, [chuckles] and I'd be living across the hall from my ex and his new girlfriend.

Not sure why I said those two in the same tone.

You know what, forget it actually.

I-I... That's on me.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I didn't think of the ex-girlfriend thing.

And then that gets us out of the whole "Here's what you need to know about Winston" conversation.

No beautiful thing has two flaws, only ugly things. It's spreading.

[gasps]

Thank you, Winston. Now I feel validated.

No, no, no, no. I just figured out why I know this house.

You see, it's in my favorite... school district.

That's nice.

Yeah.

Hey, Nick.

Sorry about the vote.

I don't want to talk about it.

Cool. I need your help with a situation.

There is no situation you could possibly describe compelling enough to get me to want to help you.

Schmidt and Cece's house was the location for the 1971 p*rn film, Daddy's Longleg.

Okay, maybe there's one situation. I'm 100% in.

That piece is exquisite.

Nick: Oh!

May I see it from another angle?

[chuckling]

Woman: He was my best friend... until he became my enemy.

Winston: The boar goes up, and the robe comes... down. That's p*rn.

You got this on a heavy rotation.

Super heavy rotation.

Please don't dance while we're watching p*rn videos together.

Oh, sorry about that. But I mean this is Schmidt and Cece's fireplace, right?

It looks like it, doesn't it?

But if it is... he can never know.

[quietly]: Oh, come on... Nick.

You know that. He can never know.

Yes, but we're already keeping five secrets from him.

The secret vault is full.

That's not true. We only have four.

We have a slot open.

You always forget.

Lost umbrella.

I forgot about lost umbrella.

Mm.

I always forget about lost umbrella.

[chuckling]: That's why it was lost.

So we're at maximum capacity. So what do we do?

Okay, so p*rn house has to go into the vault.

Agreed.

So what do we declassify?

Jalapeño 19?

Jalapeño 19? No way.

Uh... Duck, Duck, Gavin?

Oh, Duck, Duck, Gavin has to stay a secret.

I would love to keep Upper Deck Timeshare between us and the guy we paid off.

There are no good options. Are you sure this is the house?

I think so, but maybe not.

Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. I'm going to watch with fresh eyes and I'm gonna see what my gut tells me, okay?

Yeah.

You go around the house, you take photos... for comparison.

Mm-hmm. Yes.

We'll look at all the pics, we'll come back here later, Mm-hmm.

We'll make a, you know, a final call.

Boom.

[chuckles]

I need the phone for pictures.

I need it to watch the p*rn.

Use your phone.

It already started buffering.

It's two minutes in.

[quietly]: It's buffering.

Take mine... and take pictures with that.

Makes sense. It's very smart, and that is why we are The Keepers of the Five Secrets.

Keepers of the Five Secrets.

[Chinese flute music playing]

Shh.

[whispers]: Don't say a word.

[groans]

[sighs]

Gah!

Secret ballots are never really secret. You know that, right?

Okay fine. You got me.

I voted nay.

It would just be six people for too long.

We would continue to be a married couple living with three roommates.

You want to make it four, increasing our humiliation by 33%.

Mr. Miller has no interest in seeing you humiliated.

And as such, I've been empowered to offer you the following.

I'm listening.

As a symbolic gesture, Reagan cannot list the loft as her official residence.

Where will her mail go?

A P.O. Box.

Oh, yeah. All right, keep going.

When asked where you live, you and Reagan will say the following.

"Geez, beats us. We're just dumb kids living paycheck to paycheck. Thank gosh for our upwardly mobile friends Schmidt and Cece, and the three guest rooms in their loft. We're crashing with them until we get our lives together and we remain there at their pleasure."

Do I have to memorize all that?

No, you can just read it from the toilet paper.

[sighs]

And finally... you will allow Schmidt to buy you one pair of jeans.

Oh, he's serious.

♪ ♪


Hey, Jess.

Did Schmidt tell you I was gonna be in here?

No.

Then how come you didn't get scared?

Before I enter any bathroom, I take a moment to myself and say, "No matter what happens in there, don't get scared."

And it works, you know, except for that one time when I was at the Cubs...

Okay Jess, don't move.

What's happening?

Don't worry about it.

Hey, do me a favor.

Put an arch in your back, just...

[clicks]

Got it. Okay.

Let's take one together.

Oh, like a prom picture.

Yeah, kind of.

[strains]: Here we...

[clicking]

Got it.

I actually might need to retake that. I think my eyes were closed.

But first, let me see if any of this pork makes your tummy rumble.

Winston would like you and Reagan to spend a mutually agreed upon amount of time as a couple with Ferguson.

We're talking about the cat?

The only couples that Ferguson knows are interracial.

And while Winston views this as progress, he knows that it's not an accurate portrayal of... the world.

You even think that cat knows Winston exists?

Definitely not. Next, Winston would like to be the first person to see you in your new jeans.

And he will see you under these circumstances, and these circumstances only: descending a grand spiral staircase, as Winston waits at the bottom, weeping with pride, holding your new belt.

He wants me to go upstairs without a belt.

Some... We rent a really nice mansion.

Hey, you could do it, like, a museum...

I'm not going to a public place and doing this with him.

Do you want the yays or not?

I need the yays.

The motion on the floor is the same, with some riders, most notably... the Furguson Bishop, White Immersion Program.

Um, four yays, one nay?

Who's this nay?

I asked you what you wanted.

And I voted yay.

That was about the vote?

I thought y'all just wanted to get to know me better.

I was already a yay.

Well, that's everybody. Who's left?

Parikh, prepare to be buttonholed.

I'm sorry I took your yay for granted.

Let me wet your beak a little bit... you want sink time, you want fridge space, you want Schmidt and Winston to let you in on this whole jeans thing?

No, I don't want anything, okay.

I voted nay because I'm trying to protect you.

From who?

From you, you lunatic.

You were being a good friend to Nick by letting Reagan move in, but I wouldn't be a good friend to you if I just let that happen.

If Nick wants Reagan to move in, then I want Reagan to move in.

I mean, I don't want her to move in, but I... I support it.

You can support something without being the poster child for it, okay, so just maybe take a step back.

I can't do that because my love for Nick exists, so it has to come out somewhere.

If you put water in Bugs Bunny's hole, it's gonna sh**t out some other hole where Elmer Fudd least expects it.

Is this other hole friendship?

Exactly. So I can't express my feelings for Nick through my romance hole, so I need to express them through my friendship hole.

And I really regret hitching my wagon to "hole."

But you... you get it, okay?

I want you to know I'm gonna be fine, okay?

You promise?

I promise.

Okay, all right, I'll vote yay.

If Nick and Reagan aren't physical outside of their room.

I'm sorry, but I have to protect you a little, okay, so just deal with it.

That's a really great rider, Cece.

You see, I think this is the tub where Daddy bathes the Soviet dissident.

And this has to be the window seat where he spanks the Aztec twins.

Hey, side note, thank you for voting yay on the Reagan vote.

I really want her to move in. I think I'm ready for this.

She will, and you are very much so ready.

Yeah. Yeah.

So many close-ups. It's so frustrating. I mean, for our purposes of today.

You know, mostly when they cut to wide I'm thinking why the hell are you showing me the room?

But now I want to see the room. I don't want to see the close-ups.

Well, there's only one thing left.

[phone chimes]

Search the locations manager for the 1971 adult film Daddy's Longleg.

Very smart.

[chimes] SEARCH VOICE: Searching now.

[Chinese flute music playing]

Secrets.

Secrets.

Cece, this is the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.

I had always assumed that when you got serious about interior design, I was going to love your ideas.

Because I love you.

I hate your ideas. I hate them almost as much as I love you, which is so much.

I have to stop you right there.

I appreciate the fact that you are a very dramatic man, but the next time you start a conversation with, "This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to say to you," it better end with, "I'm gay now," "I found a lump in my nut," or, "He came out of nowhere, help me get the blood off of my car."

I can't live in a house that you don't love.

And I also can't live in a house of horrors!

Thank you for taking my note about being dramatic.

Next time you don't like one of my suggestions, just tell me.

I don't like your suggestions.

Okay, well, then you suggest something, and then I suggest something, and eventually we reach a compromise.

So let's try it. Let's try it with the cabinets.

I suggest a lighter wood, like birch.

Absolutely not.

I mean... [clears throat]

Mm-hmm.

I suggest a darker wood, like walnut.

So now we try to find something in the middle, like, how about oak?

That's fine, that's fine, I'm willing to go darker.

Cherry? Mahogany?

Walnut?

I love that suggestion!

It was your suggestion. It's not a compromise.

Okay, fine, birch.

No!

That was my suggestion. That's still not a compromise.

Now you're confusing me!

Jess [shouting]: Emergency off-site loft meeting!

Jess: Nick. Nick, it's time for the final vote. Where are you?

The motion now includes the Cece Parikh Hallway Decency Act.

Ugh! There's still one nay in here!

Okay, I voted yay, I swear.

Then who was it?

Woman [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions.

You have a real guilty look on your face... a real nay face.

This is not my nay face. This is... this is how does a man compromise his vision face.

Man [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions, this is Clem.

Uh, yeah, Clem, um. I'm calling about the whereabou...

[grunting]

Winston!

Clem: Sir, are you auditioning?

Admit it!

Why?

Oh... Aah...

Why?

It doesn't matter who voted nay.

The message is clear, somebody doesn't want Reagan in the loft.

So who cares who did it? Let's move on.

Who is that person? I hate that person.

Also, maybe somebody realized moments before the vote that, if you think about it, my bed... it-it tilts west.

And so she could roll off the bed in the middle of the night, and on the floor, and my floor tilts east...

Nick.

Which means she could roll under my bed and be lost forever.

Did you vote nay?

Yeah, of course I did.

I don't know what I want. I'm confused.

Ooh-whee! Politics!

Schmidt, you need to take these design blinders off and look around.

We compromise all the time.

We named our house Jaipur Aviv.

That's right.

I wanted to call it Ghatak/Mossad HQ, and you wanted to call it...

Our House.

Our House, yes.

We met in the middle and we called it Jaipur Aviv.

You know what, every compromise doesn't have to be 50-50.

I've been looking at cabinets online.

They all look exactly the same to me.

No, they don't.

They really do.

Birch, walnut, mahogany, fiberglass, stainless steel.

You can't tell the difference between metal and wood?

Not when it comes to a cabinet.

I just see cabinet, and then I go, like, "Oh, my plate's in there."

I think this is a bigger issue than interior design.

I think it just applies to cabinets.

And I accept the fact that I am not good at interior design, and you're brilliant at it.

So you should take the lead on that.

Just like I'm no good at cooking Indian food.

Mm.

You take the lead on that.

You always let me make dessert.

I always burn it.

I just want you to feel included.

Even if it's in just some small, symbolic way.

[doorbell plays "La Cucaracha"]

[melody repeats]

[melody repeats]

Okay.

Hey.

Do you know how anything works?

I know you whipped and you buttonholed and you swing-setted your tail off to get all these votes.

Who did I swing-set?

Once I got the votes, I panicked.

Because I realized that now I have to ask her, and what if she says no?

Or worse, what if she says yes, moves in with me, and then regrets it?

I wish we'd had this conversation at the beginning of the day, but yeah, I mean, I get it, it's scary.

Well, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.

You know, tell me I should vote yay.

Nick, I whipped everyone's votes.

I'm not gonna whip yours.

But whatever you decide, I support you.

We all do.

If I vote yay, all that means is is that I can ask her.

Emphasis on "can."

And that I don't have to. Emphasis on "have."

Wow. Well, no one loves parsing more than I do, and even I find this tedious, but... yes.

All right, slide me over.

Okay.

Okay.

Whoa, is this wall just sticky, or is it... magnetic?

We have got to get a magnetic wall.

We will never buy another coil of wires connected to a battery again in our lives.

It'll pay for itself in a week. [scoffs]

[Daddy's Longleg playing over phone]

Okay, Roughstuff Productions referred me to their former subsidiary Tick Tock Erotica, LLC, which split from Roughstuff back in '09.

But here's the thing. Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.

And they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.

Did he know where they sh*t it?

He did not.

All right, we've got to give up a secret.

The only question is who breaks the news.

I'll break the news if I get to pick the secret.

Deal. But I really recommend that you tell him about Halloween 2004.

Halloween 2004.

That's what I was gonna say.

[Chinese flute music playing]

Secrets exchanged.

Secrets exchanged.

Shh.

Woman [over phone]: I could never say no to the man that saved my sled dogs.

[p*rn music playing]

Schmidt, I need to tell you something unpleasant about some candy you ate.

[door opens, closes]

What?

Many years...

It was sh*t in Seattle.

Daddy's Longleg was sh*t in Seattle.

What's Daddy's Longleg?

A p*rn movie Winston and I really like.

You don't have to worry about it.

Because... it was... not filmed in your home.

So congratulations!

Wow, we did it, honey.

Was that in question?

Hey, did you ask Reagan?

I've decided to ask her, but I haven't asked her yet.

I don't know how to.

All I've got right now is, "Hey, Nickname"... that's what we're calling each other until we can think of something better.

Uh... and after that, I'm a little stumped.

Well, why do you want Reagan to move in?

Because I want to spend a lot of time with her, and if she moves in, I'll be able to spend more time with her.

Well, if she moved in, how would that make you feel, Nick?

I'd feel honored.

Honored or happy?

Both.

And what's your name?

My name is Nick.

Probably could've got that on my own.

Noted.

Wow.

I mean, that's perfect. And it's already on my phone.

But there's just some things I want to agonize over out loud with you guys.

And send.

I wanted to agonize, I said I needed to agonize I've to tell you. That was great.

God bless you.

You're welcome everyone.

You will be treated in the most efficient and pleasant way imaginable.

Proof of ownership. Liability release.

Waiver of responsibility. Smog check.

Non-operation of a boat.

Waiver of somethin'.

Liability release.

Ya-dee-da. Da-dee-da.

And da.

This is an application to join the NYPD softball team.

You think I like sitting here, handing you form after form?

Kind of.

You're right.

I do.

God, it's like you're in here.

Aw, the train! What terrible timing.

You're gonna miss the show. What a drag!

It's crazy, man.

Charles: This is amazing.

Do you guys need volunteers? Because I'll do it.

I was just telling my son how I've always dreamed of being a busker.

Well, guess what. [chuckles]

You have just introduced yourself to the best buskers in the business.

Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, due to a signal problem at 51st Street all trains are currently delayed.

Thank you for your patience.

Nick: What do we do now, Winston?

[chuckles] We are about to busk, baby.

Okay, you're busking with the best!

In the most unbelievable, I said inconceivable, unthinkable, unbelievable, also unthinkable...

Are you stalling?

[chuckles] In what world?

In-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in...

[stammering]

What-what-what-what-what-what-what-what-what-what...

Jess?

Hey, Cece, I-I know I'm late.

It's this freakin' city.

Huh?

A cop wrecked Louise's car.

What?

I'm waiting to talk to his captain.

What are you talking about right now?

Just tell her it's fine.

Did you tell Schmidt to do a roast tonight?

Funk yeah, I did. That's how you deal with this town.

Well, I think that's a huge mistake.

What, to defend your husband?

I didn't say that, Louise.

Mom, how's this?

"In conclusion, you're ugly. I make money.

"You just got roasted by the California Kid."

I think it's sensational.

[chuckles]

Can you please just get back here?

We're not ready yet!

We're not ready yet, 'cause I got to do something that you didn't know I was about to do.

Do it!

Blow your mind. Oh.

Another piece of the puzzle!

Whoa!

We're taking it to the top!

Do it, do it, [chanting "Do it!"]

Thank you for starting that chant.

Do... You got it.

Okay, it's, uh... it's looking like we have to do it.

Okay, I don't know what "it" is.

"It" is looking like a jump.

Okay, that is bone-chilling news. It's too long.

Look, we have no choice, okay? We got to get to Long Island.

[chanting continues]

We can do it. We can do it.

All right! Here we go!

Okay! Here we go! Here we go!

[chanting continues]

On the count of three.

[chanting continues]

One, two, three.

♪ Let this be a moment ♪

[distorted grunt]

♪ A moment you shine ♪

[distorted]: You can do it!

♪ 'Cause you can do anything. ♪

[grunts]

[crowd groans]

[Nick groans]

Charles: That was great. That was great!

[Nick continuing groaning] I broke my back.

Winston.

We-Well, your car should be fixed by morning.

How do I know you're not lying?

I never lie.

Although I told my mother her hair looked good once... and it didn't.

Just looked okay.

Okay, I believe you, even though you're from the city of garbage water and pizza trash.

What is your problem with this city?

[sighs]

I've just never had a good experience here.

I came here once before and it was a complete disaster.

Did you go to the opera and were disappointed?

It's this new director.

No, I actually...

I had this great week planned, and then thing after thing went wrong, and then I cut my trip off early.

Oh, my God.

[gasps]

Oh, my God.

That's when that was?

Obviously, I don't know because I have no idea what you're talking about.

I left early and I went home and surprised my boyfriend.

♪ Who's that girl... ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪

Spencer was the actual worst.

He called sex "making tacos."

Well, you know what I always say?

Things happen for a reason...

Yes, and the reason that New York sucked was because I was supposed to catch Spencer, No, you didn't let me finish.

.. 'cause I wasn't supposed to end up with him.

I always say things happen for a reason, and that reason is random chance.

No, you were right the first time.

New York wasn't kicking my ass, it was nudging it, gently, in the right direction.

[gasps]

Just like you are right now.

Yes.

Yes, that's what's happening.

You can't be mad at your past... it makes you who you are. And...

Oh, my God.

I told my friend to do something really stupid, and I have to go stop him.

Hey, do you want to do something very, super considerate?

We can't provide you with a police escort.

I wasn't gonna ask that.

Yeah, you were.

Yeah, I was.

But here: my lunch.

It's not Schmaegalman's, but take it. It's Ling's Palace.

It's fine.

It's just fine.

Oh, Dragon! Did I miss it?

Uh-uh. It's cool.

That's a really realistic-looking costume, with the smoke and everything.

Oh, you're just hotboxing.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm a vice principal.

Hey...

Oh!

You're a mess, dude.

[laughs]

And with Fitzgerald High's new scoreboard, we can make Great Neck great again.

[laughs]

Wait, wait, Schmidt.

What? What, is my makeup too thick?

What? No, no, you look great.

Uh, look, you can't do this. I was wrong.

Wh... What are you talking about? This was your idea.

I know. But I was wrong.

You can't be mad at these people.

But they were all horrible to me Jess.

And that's why you left.

You created your own path.

You changed cities. You made friends.

You found your purpose. You met the love of your life.

I sure did.

Just enjoy your evening.

You know, you have nothing to say to these people.

If anything... Thank you.

I can't wait to see the look on Schmidt's face when he realizes we made it.

Well, he wanted us to make it.

As I was saying, though, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realizes that we made it, though, right?

That's just gonna be like, "Oh."

I know, but... just be exc... Yeah, I can't wait, though, right?

Okay? We can't score without you.

[laughs]

Whoa. Hello.

Is this Schmidt? What... what are you doing?

Um... [clears throat] Excuse me, Marissa, I'm very sorry.

I... I would just be remiss if I let this moment pass me by.

You know, I'm a lucky man.

Because I wouldn't be the man that I am today if it weren't for the experiences that I've had right here.

So, thank you... for being the worst that humankind has to offer.

That includes Harvey Levin and every cast member that's ever been on The Real World/Road Rules Challenge.

Thank you for showing me that athletic apparel is something that should never be worn outside the house, you chubby-thumbed pickle hoarders.

And in conclusion, you're all ugly. I make money.

You just got roasted by the California Kid. I did it!

Oh, you sure do talk a lot when your mouth isn't full...

Great Neck.

[laughter]

Thank you, Schmidt. Boy, that was real embarrassing for you, huh?

They're taunting my baby.

This is not good.

[gasps]

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Cece Schmidt.

So if any of you have anything else you'd like to say to my husband, I will drag you outside and we will handle this L.A. style.

I will take you to the corner of Fairfax and La Brea.

Those are parallel streets. I'm not telling her that.

That's my daughter!

[crowd booing]

We have to leave. Where's my car?

Even though your car is definitely here, it's a beautiful night... let's walk.

Okay, look, she clearly did something weird with your car, but I got something.

Trust us.

Cece: Sepulveda! La Cienega, bitches. El Matador beach.

You're just naming places in Southern California.

Cece: Nickel Canyon!

What the...

Told you we were men of means.

Men of means!

[all cheering]

Yeah!

That's what I'm talking about!

All right!

Winston: Scoot over, scoot over, I can't fit.

Later, bro...

Tell 'em this story, Denny.

Tell 'em all!

You guys have a good time. All right. Uh... [grunts]

Oh, man, I'm a mess.

God, it's a perfect fall New York day. I'm almost sorry we're leaving.

Coach: What the hell is going on?

Were you not gonna call me?

How long you been here?

We literally just got here.

Well, we were gonna go...

I had a, uh...

If I wasn't...

If I didn't just run into you, you guys would have just been...

The only reason I'm not pissed... it's because I've been in L.A. like five times.

So... we're good.

[all cheering]

I've got other friends





I am so excited about this glamping trip.

Sleeping bags are for hobos and children.

Winston: I am so pumped for this trip.

Aly and I figured out how many times we would have had sex since we've been apart, and it's a whole bunch.

And we're gonna play catch-up on all of it.

All 52 times.

I am about to take Aly to Mount Smushmore.

Know what I'm saying? [laughs]

Aw. That's lovely.

We need to invite other people.

What about Nick?

No, he can't.

He has some big writing weekend.

Wants me to give him notes on his novel.

He has all the pages in some large freezer bag.

It's a hard presentation to get excited about.

You know who would really want to come?

[groans]

I am in!

Do you want me to bring my retractable s'mores pole?

Is that the car antenna that you've been putting in the dishwasher?

That is a low-level mystery that is driving me insane.

Making him crazy.

It's really handy.

All right, Jess. So just a quick warning, okay?

This is a pretty couple-y's trip, and... you know, we just don't want you to feel like a third wheel.

Yeah.

Oh. I have people I can bring.

You...

I joined a singles group.

You're meeting new people.

I think that's great.

[quietly]: Oh, my.

It's actually... a group of all singles dedicated to keeping each other single.

Wow.

I think they could probably come on the trip.

Emotionally, they may not be available, but socially, they're available as hell.

[quietly]: Just talk to her really quickly.

You know what?

Oh, you're already texting people.

They're probably not...

They're in!

Oh!

All of them! [laughing]

Honestly, they would have gone to the DMV with you, if you had asked.

[laughing]

♪ ♪

[inhales] [yells]

How long have you been standing there?

[whines]

What happened to you?

The Pepperwood Chronicles, that's what happened to me.

So it's really that bad.

Nick.

This book... is magnificent.

What?

Julius Pepperwood?

A hard-boiled Chicago cop turned New Orleans detective, racing around on fan-boats, drowning that two-faced DA in a bucket of jambalaya.

Yeah. Right in the jambalaya.

Finding John F. Kennedy... alive?

That wasn't too far?

It's a masterpiece, Nick.

Is that my whiteboard?

You said I could have it.

Well, we both know that's not true, but if it helps you get more of this story out, then, yes, you are welcome to it.

Well, all right, Schmidt, h*t me; I want your notes.

No notes!

No notes?

No notes.

No notes?!

No notes.

No notes!

No notes.

No notes!

No notes. It's perfect, Nick.

I want another chapter by the time I get back on Sunday.

Then I guess it's time for me to get to work.

My little wobbly-nosed Michael Chabon.

[both laugh]

Hey, congratulations.

Thank you, man.

I, uh... Thank you. I needed it.

I'm a writer.

[shrieks] 'Sup?

[both laughing]

[smooching] ALY: I love you. I miss you. I love you. I miss you.

You clearly didn't get my text, because your pants are still on.

[grunts]

[whooping] So excited about this.

Hey, Aly! Oh!

Your bra's already off. Okay.

We're out the door.

None of this in my car, please.

I just had it shampooed.

Jess.

I called ahead and got us an early yurt check-in.

Oh.

Beep-beep.

People about to have sex coming through.

Winston: Look out. Aren't you coming?

Actually, I'm gonna go with my group.

We rented a van. It has a built-in microwave.

We're all really stoked about it.

You're not making me feel any better about this group of strangers.

Well, it's not all strangers.

Some of them are friends! [laughing]

Robby?

My Robby?

Yeah. I got here way too early, so I've just been standing outside, kind of waiting for my opportunity to enter.

How'd I do?

Robby, are you in this group?

[snorts]

[laughing]: Is he in the group?

Robby is the founder, president, and secretary of the group.

I formed the group after Nadia dumped me.

I always use two sugars.

My mom says 'cause I'm so sweet, you know.

Oh, whoa!

I didn't want to be alone, but I also didn't want to be in a relationship.

And that's when he got the idea to bring people together to help each other stay single.

Yeah, we meet weekly for non-romantic companionship.

But most of all, we just have fun.

Yeah.

Like last week, we shut down this Korean barbecue.

We paid with 13 different credit cards, and we were asked to never come back again.

It was epic!

That sounds awesome.

Oh, man.

It's a really cool group, and we have our own motto.

Both: "I'm single and I'm sufficient."

That's I-S-I-S. That's !sis.

Th-that's !sis.

Oh, my God.

You're asking people to join !sis.

No, n-n-n-n-n-n-no.

As communication czar I should have caught that.

Yeah.

Isn't this group just a painfully transparent stall until you meet someone?

Being single is a choice.

Yeah.

Don't single-shame.

What is single-shame?

No, honey. He was not single-shaming you.

I-I wasn't...

That was not his intention at all.

I don't even know what that is.

Couples always try to talk down to singles.

We can do everything that you guys can do.

I take myself out for a dessert date every Sunday.

Yeah, and yesterday, I had a backache, and I rubbed it myself, in a doorjamb.

This is bummin' me out.

Is this group gonna be a bummer? Be honest.

Absolutely not.

There's Brenda.

She's a circuit court judge who also teaches taxidermy class for kids.

And Hugh. He grows his own onions.

My former boss and current friend, Principal Foster.

His hip surgeon has okayed him for sex, but he hasn't okayed himself.

And of course, Robby, our leader.

Have you ever seen a group more ready to have fun with themselves?

[cheering]

[horse hooves clopping]

Just look at this view; we needed this so badly.

It's-it's perfect.

Is it, though?

[camera shutters clicking]

Can you stop hogging the vista?

There are other people who would like to take a photo.

I don't want to lose this light.

It's a traditional high-noon.

Don't couple-splain light to us.

It just seems like it would be easier if you guys took a group photo.

We actually need a picture for our web site, Oh, yeah.

So, all right, you can take a group photo.

All right, let's do this.

Now, I'm only taking one sh*t, so if the first one's a silly one, you're gonna have to live with a silly one.

Okay. One, two, three. There we go. Great photo.

I'm gonna need one, too.

Actually, we're all gonna need one.

What?

Yeah, we don't share phones like you people.

Who shares phones?

How would we call each other?

I don't know.

I can't do this. This is... Take these back.

You guys are ruining a perfectly good vista moment.

Can't you go someplace else and "enjoy being single"?

[gasps] Did you just quote-hands "enjoy being single" to us?

You guys are telling each other that you're happy being this, when we all know that you would rather be this.

No. This is jazz hands, the end of an expl*sive musical number.

This is O.J. trying to put on the bloody glove.

This is freedom!

This is flying!

This is praying that you can go back to this!

This is high fives for everybody!

All around! Yes! [chuckling]

Let's go to the lake, guys. Bye.

Foster: I call dibs on the slime-free part.

Okay.

Just enjoy the view. I mean...

This is O.J. putting back on the glove.

No notes.

Okay, just... just start and see what... Just start. No notes.

All me.

No notes. What does "no notes" even mean?!

No notes.

No notes?

Come on.

[chuckles]

Nick, I'm communing with nature, and I'm almost at peace.

What do you want?

No notes?

Seriously?

It is just so nice to get out of the city and watch TV.

What about this dumb thing? When Pepperwood just watches a block of local news.

Oh, I found that part to be gutting, Nick. I mean, the irony that Pepperwood's violent world is being translated into sound bites for mass consumption...

That's just me transcribing Channel 3 News!

I didn't even change the anchors' names!

It's called realism, Nick.

No.

Good-bye, genius.

No!

[groans]

Ooh, that was... Ooh.

Winston: Oh, my gosh.

13 times.

Yeah. It's a lot of times.

A lot of times.

[chuckles] I had a good time.

I had a great time.

I could've gone so many more times than that.

Yeah, that's actually nothing.

[both chuckle]

I could go all night, girl.

I could go tens of... so many more times.

Tens of... Ten... Yeah.

Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

[sighs] Cool, cool, cool, cool.

That's what's up. That's what's up.

[phone ringing]

That's what's up.

Oh, it's the phone.

[breathy]: Hella?

Winston, are you...

Hey, Winnie, are you okay?

You sound like you're being chased up a hill.

Oh, no. Aly and I are just breaking each other off basically nonstop. It's Nick.

I told him we were breaking each other off basically nonstop.

I know. I can hear you, honey.

Oh, you heard everything? Okay.

What does he want?

I'm in crisis right now. Could you read my book and give me notes, please?

Oh, man. I don't want to take a break.

Mmm. Mm-mm.

I'm like a freight train right now.

I can't slow down.

Me either.

This is crisis!

But...

Guys, supporting our friend's artistic endeavors is also insanely...

Hey, guys. Guys, pay attention.

It's sexy.

This is crisis.

But I was thinking the same thing.

Oh, thank God.


Hello? Winston! Winston, We could easily just both read the book you're supposed to be my friend.

At the same time, and then when we're done, just get right back at it.

Right?

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Great. Now, do y... do you guys want a PDF or do you want 100 individual JPEGs?

JPEGs, JPEGs, J... JPEGs.

Uh, 100 individual JPEGs, please.

Yeah! This is gonna take forever.

[laughing]

[groans]

Five-three.

[grunts]

Hey. Oh, I was just... just playing a little single and sufficient badminton.

Well, I hope you worked up an appetite, because I'm gonna make my Singles Sliders.

Oh, yeah?

Okay, so what I do is I take the meat from three different sliders, and then I just sort of mash 'em into one big boy that stands on his own.

Oh. So, like a burger.

Yeah, it's like a burger except it's bigger.

Oh. Well, if it isn't Schmidt.

Or should I call you Schmidt-tata 'cause you have so much egg on your face?

You little Italian egg omelet.

[laughs, snorts] Nice.

Jess, what's happening in the lake over there?

Wait, is that a jellyfish?

Come over here.

Oh, please, that's so much less sexual than the stuff that you and Nick do on a regular basis.

[chuckles] Ow.

[sighs]

It's happening.

Okay, Robby...

I'm on it.

[Hugh and Brenda laughing]

Guys, guys.

No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?

You guys know that you can only be in this group if you're single, right?

It's tough.

I'm very horny.

I want you guys to be strong.

Let's do the motto.

"I'm single I'm single and I'm sufficient."

"and I'm sufficient".

Didn't sound like you meant it. One more.

Both: "I'm single and I'm sufficient."

Yes.

One last time.

"I'm single and I'm sufficient!"

Yes!

Foster: Well, I just hope we don't see a repeat of that kind of behavior with me later on.

You were amazing out there. Your ability to dampen sexual chemistry is astounding.

[chuckles softly]

Uh... [clears throat] Thanks.

Foster: Hey, guys!

I just caught a fish with my hand!

Wow. Nick's book is astonishing.

I thought it was gonna take forever, but... it was perfect.

He really brings you into the world.

Every minor character is so well thought out.

The newsboy? You could see his whole life.

And am I the only one who thought that the m*rder's name was in the song?

The m*rder's song was in the song!

Ah. So good.

No notes.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well... sex?

Yes!

Yeah?

Sex.

I'm ready if you're ready.

Yeah. Yeah.

All right.

Just a short walk to our yurt.

Unless we take the scenic route.

Oh. Nothing gets me in the mood like scenery.

Mmm?

Let's do that.

Yeah, let's go that way.

Yeah, let's do that. The scenic way.

Perhaps you could find the perfect bun if... I don't know... You had your glasses.

Oh. Oh, you know... you know who else has glasses?

Six out of ten people in the developed world, including Robby and I?

Jess, just give over to it. We're happy for you.

Use your yurt. You have a world-class yurt.

Yeah, and if this is about me and Robby dating years ago, trust me, it doesn't matter.

Mm-mm.

We only did hand stuff, per his neurosis, [groans] so you totally have my blessing.

Blessing for what?

This.

That.

Guys, I am not into Robby.

And I could never date a guy who wears glasses because of the clown from my dreams.

The clown who wears glasses.

Oh, my God, that clown is me.

I'm not dating Robby, okay?

Hey.

Oh, Robby.

Oh, hey, Robby.

I heard my name a bunch of times. I mean, I could tell that you weren't trying to call me in here, but, uh, my curiosity kicked in, so... A couple of us are gonna wander down and, uh, you know, tell some stories and, uh... [plays guitar] sing a few songs.

That sounds great. Actually, you know who loves to sing?

Actually, I've really been hating music lately.

Come on, Jess, you're a whore for singin'. Please.

Damn it!

Nick, if this is about notes, so help me God.

I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna stop bugging you until you note me, Schmidt.

All right, Nick. Here's a note.

Stop cutting yourself off at the knees like a selfish coward.

Okay, great, great. I love the direction we're going.

We're getting more critical, but can you refocus to the writing?

No, Nick, I cannot, and you want to know why?

Because you are a writer.

And a damn good one at that.

But you're just too scared to admit it to yourself.

Goodbye, sir.

No! Damn, you raven-haired dandy boy.

Yeah, thought carving our names in the trees would have taken longer.

Yeah.

[owl hooting]

So... do you want... want to have sex?

Yeah. I think that's... Yeah, let's...

Listen, Aly, I got to admit, I'm pretty tapped out.

I-I'm sorry to say it like that, but, you know, I'm...

No. Me, too! I know!

We've had too much sex too fast!

Why didn't we pace ourselves?

[sighs]

I'm so exhausted.

Oh, my gosh, I think this whole ordeal just illustrates why three months isn't three days.

So happy you said that.

[laughs]

I'm just happy to be in the same place as you.

Me, too.

And, you know, we did do it 13 times.

That's a lot.

That's a lot of times.

But you know what my favorite time was?

11? [laughs]

11. You knew.

Oh, I knew. 11 was great.

Mm. Maybe we should do 11 again.

But this time... I'm the mermaid.

Okay. I'm the mermaid.

[laughing]: No, I'm the mermaid.

Kind of, uh... Yeah, right there.

Perfect.

Get your butt down there.

[sighs]

Come here!

Ooh!

I can't!

You can't what?

I can't ignore what's going on with Brenda and Hugh!

We weren't doing anything!

I hope you guys were behaving, all right?

Because you know what happens on strike two.

Strike two and...

Strike... You're not out on strike two, but, you know, strike two, you're on thin ice.

Jess should be on thin ice.

Ugh!

She took us on a couples trip!

Yeah, that's like taking alcoholics to a brewery!

Nobody here wants to hear from you, Hugh.

You Hugh.

You... Hugh.

You made us hang out with your lame couples friends!

How are we lame?

There is no reason to att*ck us.

And when singing Toto, why is it always "Africa"?

They've got a deep catalog!

Robby: Okay.

Look, I think we can all agree that Jess is a very important member of this group.

You hypocrite.

Before you cast aspersions on anyone else, you need to take a good long look at yourself, Robby!

The emperor I don't even know has no clothes!

.. why we bothered coming here!

[overlapping chatter]

And you sexualized Toto.

No, you make a good...

I know those guys. They're good guys!

Know what? Enough!

Okay, I'm not, uh...

Guys, I'm not actually gonna smash my guitar to get your attention.

But listen, I don't want you to lose faith in this group.

Okay? Just... lose faith in me.

Because you're right. I have been a hypocrite. Uh...

I do have feelings for Jess.

Ooh.

[gasps]

Just... he didn't say what kind of feelings.

They're sexual and romantic feelings.

Oh, wow.

Oh, boy.

Brenda: Well, what do you know?

I'm really sorry about last night. Where's the group?

The group is kind of permanently done.

Robby sent out a final e-mail.

It was in Latin, uh, and it was in this gothic font.

I'm kind of worried about him.

Why don't you give the guy a chance, Jess?

[sighs] I'm not interested right now.

So, what, are you just gonna give up on love, be alone forever? Like...

No, you know me.

I love love!

Anything in pairs makes me choked up.

Shoes, socks, chopsticks.

I'm just in kind of a confusing place right now, and I think you guys know why.

It's about Nick, right?

Yes, of course we are talking about Nick.

I knew it.

Yes, I'm talking about Nick.

I knew it.

I knew it.

But, look, I want you to know something.

I'm really, really happy being single right now.

I'm sorry if my group ruined your weekend.

They're really cool people if you get to know them.

I'm sure.

[phone chimes]

Yeah. Oh, my God, I have to go.

Foster got a corn chip in his eye.

Schmidt: Okay, you know what?

We need to make a pact to befriend at least one other married couple.

Yeah, but how are we gonna do that?

We don't have a kid, and I refuse to take cooking classes.

I don't know. Maybe we just go to a Norah Jones concert, stand outside and look lost.

Well, Schmidty, you pulled a real Mr. Miyagi on the whole "no notes, tough love" routine.

Let me see it.

Ooh! Nick, there's a whole nother chapter here!

How did you make this happen?

I worked... because of you. And... who is this wise, denim-clad Jewish chaplain?

Sch-Schmith?

That was the big thing.

You helped me realize that Pepperwood needed a Schmith.

Okay. While it's an honor to be included in the world that you've created here, um... [sighs] the Schmith character seems, uh, grotesque.

Yeah, he's unlikeable.

I don't understand why, when we meet this character, he-he's kicking a puppy.

He's the bad guy... in Pepperwood's life.

He's mean, he's...

He's not somebody you want to introduce to Mom and Dad.

The cha... the character.

Schmith is a dirt bag.

I have no respect for Schmith, and neither should anybody else.

I think that's a mistake to say those things about the character.

I appreciate what you're saying, but I'm happy with what I have.

I don't need any notes.

Oh, now it's no notes?!

Nick? Nick?!

Sit anywhere?

What's up, Robby?

Hey, sorry. I'll leave. I was almost done..

No! You'll ruin your food!

Yeah, just like I ruined the group.

You didn't ruin anything. We're...

We're still hanging out.

Really?

Okay, so could you guys vote me back in maybe?

We voted to get rid of voting.

It's the same, just, uh, without the rules.

Jess, I don't really know what to say.

Don't say anything.

It's fine. I'm just gonna read.

Um, Winston gave me a copy of Nick's book.

It's actually pretty good.

Um...

[laughing]

Except the foreword says, "Best enjoyed with shrimp cocktail." [laughs]

You can go back to your crossword puzzle.

It's a word search.

Oh.

Hey, Robby?

Hmm?

Should... should we just share a table?

Is that crazy?

I don't think it's crazy at all. Do you?

No. I mean, I suggested it, so, no.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh, thanks.

Hey, Jess?

Um... I just found the word "locomotive," backwards and diagonal.

This loft has devolved into chaos.

You promised me if we had sex this morning, you wouldn't get riled up.

Sex was great. Blessings.

But look at all this mail.

Small-time drug dealers are more organized than this.

Oh, my God, my uncle Lee got married.

This is what I'm talking about.

Oh, my God, he d*ed.

Cece, what if that had been one of your college acceptance letters?

I'm transferring to a four year university.

It's no big deal.

It's huge.

You graduated from a community college.

It was a sight to behold.

[clears throat]

Cece Parikh.

That's me.

[air horn blares]

Yay!

I'm not gonna let you lose out because our roommates are a bunch of railway cats.

Clear your schedule. We're organizing.

Can't. I'm campaigning with Jess today.

Let's get ready to Rodham!

["Pump Up the Jam" by Technotronic plays]

Y'all ready for this... election?

[vocalizes]

What on Earth are you celebrating?

It's okay. We know you're voting for Trump.

Not on your life, nor am I voting for that flip-flopping helmet head in a pantsuit.

I'm only focused on one election.

The election that matters: Paul Ryan 2020.

Jess: All right.

While you sit this one out, Cece and I are gonna register new voters and help Hillary prove that a woman's place is in the house...

Both: The White House.

The people's voice must be heard and that's what I've always believed.

As I see it, we have two choices.

Continue eating this pig slop that they call butterscotch pudding or we can raise our voices and demand for locally-sourced, candied, Oregon apples!

[cheering]

You can silence me, but you can't silence the people!

This is not P.S. Hippie Montessori.

Nobody cares anymore.

Democracy is d*ad.

Wha...

If you get five new voters, hell, you know what, I'll vote for Hillary.

Excuse me?

Things... just... got... interesting.

But if you don't, you have to vote for Winston.

Bishop?

Winston Bishop?

Game on, you Republican minx.

Hey, guys, if I win, I just want you to know there will be some things that come out about me.

Just ride it out.

Reagan's in Seattle.

Aly's at Quantico.

And here we are, you and me, working that long "D".

The long what now?

We're working the what?

The long "D". Long distance relationships.

I mean, Aly and I have got it down to an art.

Really? 'Cause I'm...

I'm really struggling.

In New Orleans, Reagan and I had such an easy time talking, but now there's so much pressure that we just text.

Just talk on the phone.

I hate talking on the phone, Winston.

I feel like I'm exposing my turd pipe.

What?

I just know that I feel cold and I'm terrified.

Look, man... you got to understand something about the long "D".

At first, it's very hard.

Okay? It's a lot to take.

But the long "D" in the end is...

[chuckling] very much worth it.

You have to see what you're doing here.

Right now you're having problems.

I'm not. You know why?

'Cause you love the long "D".

I've adjusted to the long "D".

Okay.

Sometimes it's rough.

Yeah, can be bumpy road sometimes, man.

The long "D" can be bumpy.

Ooh!

Sometimes there's unexpected curves.

Don't I know it.

But once it breaks you down a little bit, you learn to like the long "D".

You're gonna say something like that?

You get used to it is what I'm saying.

I think I'm done with this.

[Cece chuckles]

Hello.

Jess: Hello.

Two canvassers reporting for duty.

Jessica Day, school administrator. Cecilia Parikh, community college graduate, soon to be transferred to a four year university.

I don't have time for this. Well, actually...

She doesn't know which one yet.

Yeah, I haven't been accepted.

I don't have time to listen to you.

Sure. Oh, no.

Just be respectful, informative.

Hillary Clinton was born in 1947 and her parents are Hugh and Dorothy.

Woman won a Grammy.

That's a fact.

Both: Takes a village.

Try phone duty.

Great.

Quick question.

I've perfected five different, assertive, female voices.

You tell me which one you'd like me to use.

[high-pitched]: Hi. [in a deep voice]: Hey.

Hello. [in a British accent]: Good day.

[in a deep voice]: 'Sup. That was one.

What is so genius about the new system is that it's completely self-explanatory.

Now, let's say you get a heating bill.

Where does it go?

Oh. [chuckles]

Didn't know I was gonna be quizzed.

Loft bills.

That's right.

And do not put that in the old mail, soy sauce, d*ad battery drawer.

Wh...

What?

What?

What is this drawer?

Take me to the drawer, Winston.

Where is it?

[gasps dramatically]

I didn't...

The hell is this?

Uh... some... some of everything.

When you cut the belly open of a shark and just everything topples out.

Have you people all just given up?

Well, hang on.

It's Cal State L.A.

This is Cece's first admissions letter.

Oh.

I got to get this to her.

Winston! I hope you're happy!

I showed her my turd pipe.

I don't know what's going on in your lives, but we need to start eating dinner together again.

Mm-mm.

Oh.

You got in my head.

I decided to call Reagan and it went horribly.

Hi, this is Nick.

Yeah, Nick Miller, boyfriend. Boyfriend.

[imitating Southern accent]: What you got?

Why am I talking this way? Hi.

Talking, me talking.

You listening, you listening.

[talking incoherently]

Next thing I knew, I was saying the words "phone" and "sex" and now she expects phone sex.

Nick, relax, man.

Help me.

I'm screwed, Winston. I'm gonna lose her.

My friend, you are not gonna lose her, okay?

Phone sex is old school.

That's how our nanas got nasty.

True, true, true.

They'd be like, "What you wearing, Gertrude?"

She'd be like, "My bloom... bloomers.

Pull down those trousers and let me see that thing."

[chuckles] But... thanks to technology, hmm, there's plenty other ways you can get sensual with your lady.

Welcome... to the Winston Bishop Clinic for Satellite Sexual Intercourse.

Eh?

This is how you do phone sex?

Video sex, Nick.

Aloha. Beautiful girl on a beautiful day in Hawaii.

Ooh.

Let's make love for the Japanese b*mb.

Oh, my God!

They're b*mb us! No!

No!

You know we share a wall, right?

Mm...

On envelopes. Really? Ugh.

We are not making a damn diff in here, Cece.

Stuffing paper.

If ten-year-old Jess could see me now...

You know, she'd be really proud of your knockers.

I never saw that coming.

Well, that's a fair point.

I did exceed expectations.

Mm.

But you know what?

We need to get off the bench and we need to go prove Schmidt wrong.

So, we need a list of potential new voters and I know just the tired, cranky broad who has one.

Hey.

Thought you could use a hot cup.

So, when the dust settles, what's, uh... what's next for the supervisor?

My name is Mary Ellen and I haven't thought about myself in weeks.

Oh, well, best of luck.

Piece of cake, Cece.

Sign up five new voters. We'll be done by noon.

Yes! Yes!

Hi, do you have a minute to talk about Hillary?

I'm voting for her.

Would you like to...

Hillary Cli...

Yes?

[chuckles]

You know who you look like?

I am not Bernie Sanders.

I am Marshall Stevens and for the last year and a half, my life has been a living hell!

[door slams]

Okay.

So, this is what all the kids are talking about these days?

Yep. Yeah.

Video sex?

Do you clean this thing regularly?

I thi...

Why are you looking up?

[phone chiming]

That's her. She wants to do it now.

[whooping] I like her style.

A little afternoon delight.

Yeah. Okay, let's pick out a backdrop.

Where do you want to get naughty?

Paris? Rome?

Huh? Drink a little tea?

That's not sexy.

Afric... nah, you don't want to...

Outer space?

You can do it in space?

Oh, yes, Nick.

You can.

And you will.

Jess: Wait. This is a sorority house.

It's probably a house full of unregistered voters.

I hear you, I do, but there's nothing scarier to me than sorority girls.

Hey, you got the keg? 'Cause we're almost tapped and I'm like, "What?"

[clears throat] Um, are you ladies planning to vote?

Yeah, bye.

[door closes]

Is she gone?

[phone buzzing]

I stood frozen like you're supposed to when you see a bear in the woods.

Hold on a sec. Hey, babe.

Where are you? I'm...

I'm at the Phish concert that you call a campaign office.

And I have your first admissions letter!

We're just actually out canvassing right now.

I'll open it when I get home.

That's not gonna work for me. I'm gonna open it now.

No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, don't...

Sorry. I can't hear you over the sound of me opening it.

You got into college!

You got into college!

I got into college.

You got into college?

[chuckling]

Cece got into college. Congratulations.

Ah, whatever.

[whispering]: Don't tell Schmidt we haven't gotten any new voters.

Tell Jess that I'm not surprised, Okay.

And her whispers are like screams.

Hey!

Whoa. All right.

The day's not done.

Money and special interests, Jess.

Let me hear you say it: democracy is d*ad.

Democracy is... alive.

He got where I was going.

Whew.

Let's find you a home.

Thank you.

Oh.

Supervisor: Uh, we lost a couple of deadbeats over in envelopes. We need you there.

I'm not one of you people.

I'm very sorry. I'm a Repu... Hmm.

I'm repulsed by that garbage dump you call an envelope station.

Great. Then organize it.

No.


[phones ringing]

[singsongy]: I'm-a make a system.

I couldn't see the smug look on Schmidt's face, but I could feel it.

I'll be damned if I cast a vote for Bishop-Furguson.

Wait, where-where are you going?

Back to the coven of Greek sirens.

I say we go in hard, with the violent history of the suffragette, and then, we ease into some light reproductive rights.

That is one way to do it.

Or...

Who's ready to party?

And gab about the kind of world we want to leave our grandchildren!

Hopefully one that's full of parties!

[cheering]

You're gonna graduate soon, okay?

So, this is your turn to really speak up and make a difference...

And it's your turn to drink!

Oh, okay. All right, just, um, okay...

I love you, booze girl. Take a sh*t!

Oh, no. I don't...

sh*t!

I don't want to take a sh*t, but I do want you to sign up to vote.

I can't sign it if you don't take a sh*t.

That's such a good argument. Okay.

[sighs] Oh...

All right.

You all have ten sh*ts and I have one.

But, if you share the wealth, then we can all throw up together.

And that's called redistribution.

[cheering]

That's what I'm saying!

Ah, you're welcome! [laughs]

[all chanting]: Booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl...

Oh, bingo.

I feel sexy.

Can I, uh, practice some sex talk I've been working on?

Pretend you're Reagan.

[exhales]

Take off your space pants, I want to do sex with you over this video thing.

Don't overthink it.

Okay...

I can't see anything in here, but... here goes nothing.

[phone ringing]

In ten hours, I'll be d*ad.

I'm headed straight to the sun, which is actually a star.

But it's our star.

And it's worth saving.

Nick?

Anyway... here's my penis.

Oh! [screams]

Nick, put it...

Nick, what are you doing?

[yelling] No! No!

Where's Winston?

This is my nightmare!

[Aly screams]

Face your fears, Nick! Talk to Reagan!

It's not Reagan, it's Aly. Let me out!

No, no. Aly? Don't look! Close your eyes!

[Nick and Winston yelling]

Aly: Is that a comet? What...

Oh, wow!

Look at me, baby. Look at me.

I feel like I should tell you, I saw the whole thing.

Schmidt: One, two, three.

Stuff.

Jenise, we just... We don't touch this pile.

We touch those piles.

Thank you. 'Lopes!

Excellent.

What are you doing here?

You're interrupting.

I like your work, new guy.

I need you on the phones.

What about my 'lopes?

Nope. Phones.

Just read the script.

Okay, fine. But only one call.

That's it. And then I'm taking my talents back to mailers.

Yes, hello.

I'm calling to remind you to vote for a better America and a vote for a better America is a vote for Hubbedy Bubbedy.

Hillary Clinton.

That's what I said. Hibiddy Bibbidy.

It's Hillary.

Yes, I know.

Hillary Clinton!

And I keep saying that. Okay?

Hubbedy Barry.

Maria Conchita Alonso.

What's wrong with you?

Celery Flintstone.

I can't do this!

Vote for Paul Ryan in 2020!

Paul Ryan in 2020!

Paul Ryan! Give me that.

Paul Ryan in 20... 2020, for President of the United States.

Paul Ryan in 2020!

Pau... Paul Ryan in 2020.

President of the United States.

Paul Ryan in 2020!

Paul Ryan! Paul Ryan in 20...

[struggling] Get off of me!

You smell like a wet campsite.

[Schmidt yelling, other exclaiming]

Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

Excuse me, would you like to talk about...

Oh, my God!

Jessica?

Cece!

Jessica?

Oh...

I feel like I haven't seen you in so long.

Like, in years.

You look friggin' amazing!

Shut up!

Truly, like, the best I've ever seen you.

Shut up, Keep doing whatever you are doing.

You bitch! I love you.

Phenomenal.

I love you.

Phenomenal.

But you know what else I love?

Mm, what?

These signatures!

Hey!

Oh, my God.

That's what I'm talking about!

Oh, my God.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's what I'm talking about.

Yes! Yes!

Those! Plus all these.

Schmidt, we b*at you! Bye!

Yeah. Yeah, we b*at him!

And you know what else?

I'm coming with you to college 'cause sorority girls love me.

Just ask my new besties... Anita Wang!

Ivana Getsum.

[sighs]

Ah, hell.

Jessica damn Day.

All of those names are fake.

What a freaking buzz k*ll.

You didn't see that when they wrote it down there?

You're so great, let me look at yours.

You check your facts. Check...

Check it.

Melanie Fart signed yours five times.

Who wrote Melanie Fart?

They think ma-democracy's a joke!

Democracy's not a joke!

No.

It's the system by which we live!

Ladies!

I'm yelling from a balcony!

Your female forebears fought to give you a voice.

One of them threw herself in front of a horse.

A horse!

Jess, come down, okay? You're drunk, they're all drunk.

I'm drunk.

We lost the bet.

This is not about the bet, this is about America!

[sighs] Here we go.

Now, you ladies can sit on the sidelines and let someone else dictate your futures, or you can speak up and take charge of your lives.

Now, if you're not willing to do that, then shame on you.

But if you are, then I want to hear your voice.

Where are you...

Ivana Getsum?

How about-how about you, Anita Wang?

[women chuckling]

Show your face, Melanie Fart.

Where you at?

Are you serious?

We had a real moment.

How about, um...

Babaloo Softlock?

Holden D. Cankles, where...

Woman: I'm here!

Burt Tacomeat?

Jackie Rectum?

Boobs Gargler?

Diaria Jones?

Oprahs' friend Gayle?

Yaseen Maboobs?

Claude b*lls?

Woman 2: Here!

Well, I'm booze girl, and booze girl wants to hear... your voices!

All [chanting]: Booze girl! Booze girl!

Booze girl! Booze girl! Booze girl!

All right, now I need your real signatures!

The forms are all filled up.

Well, then let's march to the headquarters!

[cheering and whooping]

[cheering and whooping continues]

[sighs]

Hey, buddy, we doing all right?

Yeah, never better.

Aly saw my ass in space, Reagan still wants to have phone sex with me, and I just panic-ordered $200 worth of Chinese food.

You know what, man? That's on me, I...

I pushed you to use my style when I should have encouraged you to use your own.

Winston, if I had any style, I would call my girlfriend instead of using my best friend's electronic sex shed.

"Every moment you're on this Earth, is a moment I know where you are."

You know who wrote that?

The great James Baldwin.

No, you wr... James Baldwin?

What?

Look, man, you sent me these cards when I was playing basketball in Latvia.

And, I don't know, I kept all of them.

They're beautiful, man.

"I screamed your name at the ocean today, then I ate a sandwich that tasted like your smile."

I wrote that to you? Yeah.

Boy, we used to be a lot closer.

This is your style, man.

Use it.

Thank you.

Hey, uh, Reagan, this is Nick Miller.

You said you wanted phone sex, so, here you go.

Here's your phone sex.

Get ready to, uh, have a... an orgasm, I guess.

When I'm done with, uh... I'll just start.

You are a real sandwich lady, and I want to scream your name across the ocean.

Winston: Ooh, hoo!

That's nice.

Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's that's Winston.

Yeah, he's in here to help, he's actually been very helpful.

What's up, girl?

He says "What's up, girl?"

Oh, yeah, I'll def... Yeah, makes perfect sense.

You need to leave right now.

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

Okay. Bye, Reagan.

No, Winston, I mean it. She brings up a valid point.

We're about to do phone sex, and...

I'm walking out...

All right, Winston, take off.

Sure. For sure.

No, Winston, I mean it.

This is me telling you as Nick.

I would like you to leave.

As Nick. Ooh!

h*t the road.

Oh, for real?

Yeah.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Yeah.

All right, then.

Oh, hey, hey, before I go, it may be bad timing, but you want to grab brunch with my boy Willy tomorrow?

No.

I'll talk to you later.

I don't want to.

You'll change your mind. [laughs]

This is awesome.

I hope we get to meet Ivanka. I love her shoes.

Ivanka?

Yeah, Donald's daughter. We all love her.

And we love the Donald!

All: Trump!

[cheering]

Oh, okay, what do we do? What do we do?

What do we do? Turn right!

[all cheering, shouting]

[cheering continues]

Right, run!

Right, right.

Whoo!

You can register online. Democracy lives!

Let's go. Come on, let's go.

Are we going in the right direction?

Doesn't matter. Keep running.

I mean, you helped those girls find their voice, you know, it just... wasn't the one that you wanted.

You helped me find my voice, too.

I'm not sure you're gonna want to hear that one either.

What do you mean?

I don't want to go to college.

What?

When Schmidt opened my letter, I could hear the excitement in his voice, and I could see it in your face, but...

Cece...

I felt nothing.

Schmidt, please talk some sense to your wife.

She says she doesn't want to go to college, but tell her that a four-year education...

No, okay, look, Jess, Jess, I know school is your life, okay, and I respect that, you know that I do, but we're different people.

I don't want to be stuck in a classroom.

I want to be out in the world working with people.

I just really need you both to support me.

I support you. I will always support you.

I mean, this sort of ruins my dream of... taking you in a dorm room, but...

A dorm room?

Did you think I was gonna move out?

I thought...

Cece...

I want what's best for you, so if this is what you want...

It is. Trust me.

Booze girl loves you.

Oh, I love you, booze girl.

I love you, too.

What?

What is this?

This is a memento from a dark period.

Hey, Winston, I lost the bet.

I'm gonna be voting for you.

And I'm scared to ask, what is your platform?

Well, first of all, I just want to say that my portrait, it will be silly.

And I will change the national anthem to something like this.

[falsetto]: ♪ Oh, yeah ♪
♪ America... ♪

Schmidt, please don't make me do this.

I have to vote for Hillary.

♪ Get, get, get, get America, America. ♪

All right, but a bet is still a bet.

Then I will hire, 'cause...

[Impersonating Trump] You're fired.

You are fired.

You're a loser. What can I say.

It's sad.

Your car is huge. It's beautiful.

Opulent. It's huge Someone just jump the curb and h*t me now.

Please.

How much longer do I have to do this Schmidt?





Jess, why couldn't you marry me?

Oh, I don't know.

You know.

No, I-I don't know.

It's Nick.

I... love you.

You love me?

I love you.

I love you, too.

Wow, that feels so good to say.

I now pronounce you husband and...

[glass breaks, cheering]

I'm booking a ticket.

A ticket?

Yeah, Reagan is going to New Orleans for work for three months and she asked me to go with her.

And I'm gonna do it.

♪ ♪

[phone chimes, Cece gasps]

Damn it!

This is an alert?

I did not need to know that the Riblet sandwich is back.

How long does it take to respond to a house offer?

Breathe, okay? We will find out about the house when we find out about the house.

You're right.

All right.

You're right. Okay.

We're fine. We're fine.

We're fine, we're fine.

[both sigh]

I'm so excited!

We're finally getting a house!

As I was saying, I never felt love like this.

I really miss your lips on mine.

Babe, it's just a two month FBI training program.

I had a major breakthrough this week.

I perfected my "keep vamping, we've almost traced the call" gesture.

Oh, wow, really?

Well, you know, we've had some breakthroughs of our own over here, too.

You know, I got to say, your sister is really coming into her own as a real estate agent.

In fact, I think she may have found a house for Schmidt and Cece.

That's amazing!

Oh, thank you so much for looking out for Leslie.

It means the world to me.

Well, would you describe yourself as, I don't know, owing me?

'Cause I will take my repayment in the form of...

[loud grinding]

What the hell is that noise?

Jess? For Pete's sake. [Knocking]

What is that infernal racket?

Hey, I was just making some table legs.

But if it's too loud, I can table them for later.

This whole summer, you've been doing one activity after another.

The urban corn harvest.

Learning Portuguese.

You joined that SoulShred gym and got scary ripped.

[nuts clatter on floor]

Oh.

[grunts loudly]

What is going on with you?

Okay. All right. [Clears throat]

She's a badass, that is what is going on with her.

Woodworking is awesome.

Okay, woodworking is insane.

It's woodturning, but go on.

Honey, do you think that any of these hobbies have anything to do with...

With Nick? Nicholas Miller?

That ole turkey burger?

Yeah.

He's in New Orleans with his perfect girlfriend.

And I'm fine.

Okay.

Actually, I'm doing great.

Okay.

[stammering]: I moved past him.

I-I-I'm over him.

Just checking.

I'm moving forward.

Cool.

Or as they say in Portuguese, Empurrando para a frente.

Which technically means "thrusting forward."

It's a very sexual language.

Honey.

We got the house.

[gasps]

We got the house!

[screams excitedly]

Leslie, I can't believe you pulled this off.

Every morning I just Google "house" and sometimes stuff comes up.

Guys, look at us.

You guys are married.

Winston, you're in love, Nick's in a serious relationship of his own, and I am a truly excellent friend.

Why are you looking at my house?

Hello, sir, how are you?

We're the ones who are buying your home.

I'm not selling my house.

What?

Oh, maybe that's why there's no sign.

Maybe I got the address wrong.

I mean... What are you ta... how did we get into the house?

We walked through it three times.

What?

What?

What?

Oh that's a mistake.

Why would you do that?

Cece: Oh!

He's got a bat! [Panicked shouting]

Jess: Oh, my God, the car's the other way!

I'm sorry, sir.

♪ ♪

All right, I'm taking charge.

Winston, Leslie has to go.

No!

She's the worst real estate agent of all time.

Aly and I just went long distance.

I can't tell her that you fired her little sister.

This is a delicate situation for our relationship.

Please, Jess.

Why are you ask... why are you asking Jess?

And, Jess, why are you inserting yourself into this?

If anyone's inserting themself, it's Winston.

He's like a tongue at a seventh grade birthday party.

Okay, look, fine, can I at least be the one to break the news to her?

Yes, you may.

Thank you, Jess.

It is so great to know.

Yeah. who your real friends are.

Yeah.

Get off the sofa.

Yeah.

Go check on your cat.

Look, we'll find a place, okay?

I didn't like that house that much anyway.

I just can't be married, living with roommates.

Well, hey!

Well, I hope you saved some for Furguson.

[singsongy]: 'Cause you forgot yesterday.

[chuckles]

No!

[screams]

[screaming]

No!

Look at our wedding photo.

I want to hang our wedding photo in our house.

I want to start our lives together.

I know.

Guys, we are in this together.

We're just gonna have to find a house ourselves.

I need a project now that my table's almost done.

I'll be your real estate agent.

I've already found, like, five open houses today.

Like, this one is a fixer-upper, but don't judge a house by its smoke damage.

Okay, babe, this was a crime scene.

Yeah, but that was months ago.

And it was drug thing, so there are no ghosts.

That's not how ghosts work.

This is in your price range, and it's, like, only five minutes from the loft.

I really think this is the best investment of our money right now.

Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

Hey, babe?

[groans]

I think we got this, okay?

Yes.

We got this.

Actually, we, we got this.

Preach! We got this.

Jess, look at us for a second, the two of us, Cece and I.

We. Us.

Both: We got this.

We got this.

[chuckles]: All right.

Schmidt, bedrooms. Cece, bathrooms.

I'm gonna smell everything.

Bonjour! Crawdaddy's home, and he's ready to see his crawkids!

Who's home?

Schmidty, Jess?

Winston?

Winston's cat?

Fine. Cece?

♪

The en suite is en fleek.

I love this house, too.

I poked my head in the shower.

Perfect, gentle, unrelenting pressure.

Like when my mom made me rehearse my haftarah portion.

I don't know, guys.

Lot of lost dog posters around.

Really sad neighborhood.

Also it's crazy expensive.

I'm the voice of reason, that's why you brought me with.

We-we didn't bring you with.

You followed us here in your car.

Okay.

She followed us the whole way.

I know, I know.

Cece, I'm begging you, please tell her to go home.

Yeah, I know.

We need to start setting some boundaries.

You know what, though? She's not wrong.

This place is way over our borrowing limit.

Damn it. [Sighs]

The only place that was even close was that...

Both: Carpet house.

All right. We will ask for a bigger loan.

And It'll be tight, but we'll manage it.

Okay.

Yeah, we can do it.

Look, we'll just make sacrifices.

Yeah.

We'll pack our lunches.
We'll cut out cup-on's.

It's coupons.

Cup-ons, yeah.

No, you're saying cup-ons.

Well, it's fine.

It's not important, we'll cut out cup-ons.

Coupons.

But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to go to the bank now because this house is gonna go like this, I know it.

Why is she talking to the realtor?

I will handle it, okay?

It's-it's tot... it's... Oh.

Jess?

I'm so sorry, do you mind if I just steal her away for a minute? Jessica?

Hey, honey, this can't happen.

You're right, this is not your house.

Toni-Anne, we're walking!

No, no.

You being here.

You taking over as our real estate agent because... you can't stop thinking about Nick.

Cece, not everything's about Nick.

Curvando diante da face errada.

In Portuguese, "You're bending before the wrong face."

Again, very sexual language.

You know I love you and I will always be there for you in an emergency, but Schmidt and I need to do this by ourselves.

You got to go home.

Okay. I got it. Okay.

You guys are moving forward, You don't need ol' Jess the Mess.

I'm gonna go home.

But seriously, I crawled under the house and the retrofitting is rookie work.

Okay.

She going home?

Yeah, let's go to the bank.

Let's do it. You know what, actually, I just want to use the cooktop first.

Make an egg.

Honey, where are you gonna get an egg?

Got two eggs right here.
Got a pan right here.

Think I'm gonna buy a house and not make an egg first?

And I'm a Sagittarius, which is why I'm so good with people and horses.

But it also makes me, like, really sleepy.

Uh, Leslie... [nervous laugh]

Um, there's no... there's no easy way to say this.

Uh... you... no longer work... for Schmidt and Cece.

No, no, they're f*ring me?

No, but didn't you tell them how good I am?

Well, you know, I tried to.

I was like, I was like, "Man, she good..."

You didn't stick up for me, Winston?

Well, I tried...

I'm calling Aly!

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, no, no, time out, time out.

Listen, hey, hey, hey.

Time out. Stop.

Stop that. You didn't let me finish.

You don't work for Schmidt and Cece anymore, because...

'Cause you work for me now.

I'm buying a house.

[Shrieks happily]

I'm buying a house!

[Laughing]

Ha, ha! I'm buying a home.

[horns honking]

We do not look great on paper.

Please, on paper, we're as ugly as Winston's bellybutton ring.

Who gets a bellybutton ring if you have an outie?

And at 33, no less.

But trust me, loan officers have a lot of discretion.

We just need to market ourselves.

We need to look him right in the eye...

Mr. Schmidt and Mrs. Parikh?

I'm not blind.

I just had my pupils dilated for an exam.

If it makes you feel any better, I'm seeing stars, too.

What?

I'm talking about you.

Okay, honey, just... shh.

Shh. You're a big, bright star.

It ain't gonna be that kind of party today, pal.

Follow me.

[exhales]

Nick [muffled]: Hey, Crawdaddy's home!

[coughs]

I had a whole crawdaddy thing, but I... the point is, I'm home.

[clears throat]

Hey, Nick.

You weren't supposed to be home for, like, a month.

Are you guys doing okay?

Yeah, uh, Reagan's drug company is moving her up to Seattle...

Okay. so we're doing the distance thing.

Yeah, we're doing great.

You know what they call Seattle in Portland?

North Portland.

Or, uh, Vancouver's Shoe.

What?

Vancouver's Shoe.

[chuckles]

Get in here!

Give me a hug!

Okay.

All right!

Wow, look at you.

You got jacked. Yeah.

What, did you go to prison?

[chuckles]

[laughs] No.

I worked out a lot.

Come on, sit down.

I haven't seen you in months.
I need some Jess.

I also have something very important to tell you.

Is everything okay?

Um...

I have to, um...

It's just, I have to meet my friend.

I mean, I have to go to the zoo.

The zoo? You hate zoos.

Um, I was supposed to meet her in the lemur section of the parking lot like ten minutes ago, so...

What friend?

Why...? Deedee.

I have to meet Deedee.
She's, like, a good friend.

"Deedee"?

That's not a name.

You have one friend. It's Cece.

This sounds fishy.

Yeah, no.

We can't loan you any more money.

Jess [whispering]: Cece!

Oh. Okay. What?

No, I... I-I know what this is about.

I'll just be a moment.

You know what what's...

Thank you.

Ce... ce...

What's happening?

What is happening?

Jessica...

You said "emergency."

Well, this is an emergency.

Nick is home.

What is your emergency?

Don't glory in it, Cece.

Please don't mistake my measured bank tone for calmness, as I am filled with the waters of rage.

Jess, I know that you've come here to convince Cece that she shouldn't buy this house.

No.

Babe, this is an emergency.

I have feelings for Nick again, okay?

There. I said it.

[sighs]

I saw him for one second and I freaked out.

I told him I was going to the zoo.

Both: You hate the zoo.

There's something about him.

I see him and my heart explodes.

We all need to meet new people.

Oh...

[seagulls squawking]

Where are we?

Your new hood!

Okay, so, I couldn't check all the boxes, but I think nailed the most important one: That it can float.

That's a... that's a boat.

Yeah.

I was just driving to my doctor's office last night and I saw it.

And you thought, "Okay."

Where-where's your doctor's office?

Three boats down.

Should we call Aly and tell her the good news?

I had no idea you were going through this.

I can't even be in the same room as Nick.

I don't know what I'm saying and what if I say something that ruins our friendship?

Get out.

What?

Get out. Get out right now.

Get out instantly.

What?

What happened to the "I'm so sorry"?

Nick is on his way to the bank right now. I texted him.

I need his help with the loan.

What?

What?

We need to put the bar up for collateral, okay?

We're miles past our borrowing limit. It's the only way.

Yeah, but the bar?

No time. There he is.

What?

Schmidt: Hey, Nick!

Ah!

[laughing]

Just pretend like we're having a normal conversation.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Okay. Um...

This is, um, this is Margaret.

This is Gracie.

Oh. No. You think I...

Oh, no.

I'm not a bank robber.

Stop reaching for that button.

I'm just trying to avoid my ex.

Oh, thank God.

God, I missed you.

You know, I slept in your bed twice.

Look at your hair, you hippie.

Yeah, just come over here! Great!

Um, oh. Uh, heads up.

There are over 60 pairs of shoes in your room.

Uh, heads up, they're all in the hallway now.

Oh, okay.

Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

This is my co-signer.

[sighs]

Nick: Point me in any direction and I'll sign.

[chuckles]

So this is the place, eh?

Beautiful picture of it.

That's how much it is?
That's really exp...

Schmidty, are you sure you know what you're getting us into?

Yeah, man.

All right.

[Cece giggles]

Congrats.

Did we get the loan?

I wish it were up to me, because the answer would be "no" and all of this would be over.

He's been a buzzkill all day.

Yeah. That's all right.

I owe you one American dream...

[laughs]

You sweet angel.

We did it!

I'm so happy for you guys.

Hey, I gotta go.

[photo clatters to floor]

I got it.

Beautiful family.

[exhales] It's okay, it's okay.

[exhales] This is stupid.

I can't keep hiding from him.

Jess, just give me a sec, okay?

No, Cece... Cece, it's fine.

I'll come back with you.
Go... go with Jess now.

No, no, no, no.
I have to do this myself.

And you guys have to buy a house.

This is good; This is you moving forward.

Thanks, Jess.

Get in here.

Oh, I love you guys.

Okay.

[grunts]

Oh... Oh, my God.

[laughs]

Lost my breath, there.

She's a strong... strong one.

Well, you're getting the loan.

What?

Interest rates are about to drop and we want to settle you with a high one before they do, so...

We got the loan?

We can make an offer?

[laughing]: It doesn't make a lick of sense to me, but there you go.

So many zeros.

That's a lot of zeros.

What are you doing?

Winston: Hella?

Are you buying a boat?

[sighs]

Look, it is a complicated situation.

First off, I think your sister is amazing.

Secondly, I know that we just went long-distance and I don't want to give you any bad news, but... your sister ain't that good at her job.

Like, at all.

She's... uh, dumb.

That girl is the trunk of a tree.

Ain't nobody at home up here.

Okay, you...

She a cottonhead!

Easy...

This girl is a dumped-out sewing kit.

Easy.

She talkin', but ain't nobody listenin'.

Easy. That's my sister.

And I know she's an idiot.

[exhales] Thank God.

Just because we're long-distance doesn't mean we can't be real with each other.

Okay?

We have to tell each other everything.

[sighs]

I don't know what the word "panache" means.

It means having a certain kind of flair.

Oh. Sorry.

You go, you go first.

How was New Orleans?

How-how was everything?

It was great.

I was writing 2,000 pages a day by hand.

What?

By hand. Yes.

Unfortunately, it all blew into the Mississippi River.

Oh, my God, no. That's terrible.

I mean, for you and for the environment...

And I had to start over, so I invested in a computer...

I bought the heaviest one I could find... and look... heavy computers, heavy materiel.

This is my first book.

What?

Yeah.

This is what I wanted to tell you.

Oh, my God.

[laughing]: It's my book!

Nick, how many days did it take to print this out?

About a week. I had to go to a car rental place at night, but, uh... read the first page.

"To Anthony Rizzo and the Chicago Cubs, for all we've been through."

"And to my friend Jessica Day... for the same thing."

I don't know if you remember this, but, uh... you were the one who told me to go to New Orleans.

So thank you.

You're welcome.

We got the house.

For real this time.

That's great!

Come on, let's go see it!

Nick: Let's go!

Guys, I know I found this place, but... yikes.

Is that a bloody kite?

I smell coyote babies.

The other house was just too expensive.

Cece: Yeah, this place is actually perfect.

Or at least it will be, once we redo it.

This whole room could be mid-century.

You could use the crown molding as a focal point.

I'm inserting.

It's okay.

No.

Look, we clearly are gonna need everyone's help on this.

I'm going to get off this plane no matter what.

You just need to buy me an hour.

We got this.

There's been a minor delay.

The vineyard dog is giving birth.

Get them drinky so they don't get thinky, over.

♪

So do you know the bride or the groom?

The bride destroyed my heart.

I destroyed the groom's Jew penis.

Mm. I hope you guys are giving a toast.

Pilot: Ladies and gentleman, I'm afraid it's going to be another hour, and we are out of snacks.

Damn it!

I'm getting married today!

Somebody get me off of this plane!

People are getting hammered, over.

[laughter]

Look at this goddess.

Don't do this to her.

I swear to God, I will scream sing every last word to Les Mis.

Sir, if you don't sit down, I'll have you removed.

Perfect!

And placed in FBI custody.

I suppose I'll just have a tomato juice.

Hi.

Hi.

How are you?

I'm good. How are you?

Good, yeah.

Great, look at this.

What is that, a towel?

I think it's a pashmina.

"Pashomina"?

Pashmina.

I'm sorry, I just can't believe you came.

I did.

Things I'm feeling: excited.

Number two: scared.

I mean, are we gonna do this? You and me?

Take it home.

Take it to the mat.

I don't know what that means.

You know, like, the big "R."

Oh, a relationship?

No.

[laughs]

No, no.

See when I say, The big "R,"

I'm, of course, talking about, uh, rasslin'.

Yeah, I think that's a "W," "W-R."

Do you ever feel, deep down, that you know at some point you're gonna have a stroke and it's gonna be really bad?

Jess...

I have some Honduran matrimony beads for my son.

Where's Schmidt?

Jess [whispering]: Winston.

Winston.

I cannot believe I'm asking this... but I need you to prank this wedding.

Please.

Please, we need to distract people.

He's a serious man now.

He doesn't prank anymore.

Just look at his eyes.

All the mischief's gone.

If this were another time, another day, hell, even six hours ago...

Listen to me, you bird-shirted, puzzle baby.

You get out there and you do something totally idiotic right now!

[May and Coach laugh]

Funston, we have a pranklem.

[laughs]

I'm not good at these.

It's a weird one.

Okay... update.

The vibe's getting ugly.

People are getting dangerously drunk.

I found a loose EpiPen on the floor, which can't be good.

I think we're gonna have to start telling people that Schmidt's... on a plane.

Or not. Don't freak out.

Mom?

Schmidt's on a plane?

Mom, what are you doing here?

If you've come to object to this wedding, you are too late, and in another sense, because it's delayed, you're... too early.

That's not at all why I'm here.

Schmidt: Mama P. Schmidt with the latest, "Why I Love Cece." Today's episode: Honesty with a Capital Ouch. He called you?

Every Monday for the past year.

[beeps] Your daughter is the best thing...

[beeps] I just lost a fight in the desert, but...

[beeps] And I want her to be the last thing I see when she pulls the plug.

[beeps] But it's not an A-plus unless we both finish. [Beeps]

She's so beautiful.

The odds are really stacked against our children.

They're not all winners.

[beeps] I just know that if you miss your daughter's wedding, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.

I am delighted for you to marry this man.

Flight attendant: For those keeping score with row five, Cece's mom is at the wedding!

[cheering, laughter]

[cheering continues]

Just get here when you can, okay?

We'll wait until you do.

You know what? Have the party without me.

Babe.

No. Okay, no.

Have the party. We'll...

We'll get married at City Hall with all the immigrants and liberals and first cousins.

Your whole life has been about this party.

My whole life is you.

Plus, my cousin Nathan is just dying for something to go wrong.

I'm so happy.

I have an idea.

Conga!

As we all know, marriage is about sex and property.

Everybody say that with me once.

Marriage is about s...

I imagined that differently.

You're okay. You're okay. Pull it together.

Just let the index cards go.

Speak from the heart.

You know who I'm talking to when I say you were rude to me earlier at the bar.

And now who's in control? I could point to you and call you out, but I won't.

When I first met this guy, Schmidt, I thought, "I'm not gonna be friends with him."

I don't like his personality."

Magic's fake.

[guests murmuring]

Believe what you want, but I want you guys to think about something, and now this is off the jack.

In a couple generations, we're all gonna be d*ad, and no one's gonna remember any of us.

I mean, think about it. Do you remember your great-great grandparents or... or their parents, or what they did day to day?

The point is, it doesn't matter.

Everyone you know will be d*ad.

That's right.

Congratulations, man. I love you.

Best friends.

That's my time, everybody. Thank you.

Look, if it made sense, it wouldn't be my wedding.

Your speech wasn't that bad.

My speech was fantastic.

It's the best 17 minutes of my life.

I really opened up my heart.

I was gonna say.

Nah, I'm just feeling bad about Reagan.

I think I came on too strong, or-or...

I don't know. She told me she's leaving tonight on a train.

On a train? Where's she going, Hogwarts?

No, San Diego.

I don't know if "Hog-warts" is near San Diego.

I've never heard of it.

Never mind.

But, I mean, it's okay. I just, I feel like I, you know...

I just got excited for a second.

Nick, she came here to see you.

I bet you're reading into it. What if I go talk to her?

Talk me up a little bit?

Woman to woman?

That's implied.

Winston.

Winston: No hay Weenstons. It's ocupados.

Winston, I know you're in there 'cause I'm looking at a picture of your butt cheeks right now.

Oh, that's a working class butt.

Nothing wrong with that!

Mm.

Give me...

Give me those.

That's a fatty. You got a fatty.

This is not Winnie's day.

Ernie, give him your jacket.

What?

Give me the damn jacket.

All right, here, dude.

I jabbed my giblets in the breast pocket. Tie it around your waist.

Then that leaves the front porch open or the back.

I don't think this is gonna work.

I'll just sit here cold and naked while my best friend gets married.

Look, you were right, Coach.

I'm not a serious man. I'm a nude, apple bottom, long-fronted dumb-ass.

Ooh, look. At least you can change the background. Look.

Now I'm in the Oval Office. That's crazy. [Camera shutter clicks]

Winston, you're a groomsman and a bridesman.

It doesn't get more serious than that.

You can't miss this wedding.

But what am I supposed to wear?

I am looking for the groom.

♪

Schmidt. What's up, man?

I know I'm wearing a photo booth curtain right now.

That does not take away from how incredibly happy I am for the both of you.

Thank you.

Winston, I'm going to get off this plane soon.

Oh, dear Lord! Winston!

Pick it up!

Don't squat! [Guests groaning]

So, I mean, I feel like I really put myself out there, right?

I got on a plane, and I flew across the country to see him.

I couldn't get him out of my head, you know?

Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah.

And then he says the word "relationship," and I freaked out, because... [chuckles]

You know what, I don't know. Am I crazy to want a relationship with Nick?

I mean, you guys were together. What happened?

We were kind of a mess.

I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.

And... he wanted me to not care about those things.

That's not so bad. I mean, who really has a plan for their life?

[chuckles] Who does that?

[chuckles] Me.

Me. I d... I did it.

I do it. I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there who keep a very traditional banking account. Yeah.

There are. And I just dated one of 'em.

And I...

I don't think any of that stuff matters.

She wants to do this.

Well, that's awesome. Congratulations.

Yeah, I'm freaking out. I can't believe it.

I mean, why does she want to be with me?

It doesn't make any sense.

You of all people know that I'm just the weird detour you take before you find the guy you want to be with.

I basically just help women realize that they could do a lot better...

[seagulls screeching]

So nice of your mom to get us this trip.

Much better than my dad's gift of weed gummy bears.

[laughs]

[both sigh heavily]

Aah! What the hell is happening?!

What?! What is happening?!

No! No!

Ha-ha! Happy honeymoon!

Winston!

[laughs]

How long has he been in there?

It's gonna ruin the whole freaking vacation!

Winston: Honeymoon prank!

What are you all drinking?





Ye!

Tran.

Great lasagna, it was fantastic.

Now you're fishing.

It was just good, and you know it.

You used the cheap cheese, and that was your mistake.

Great noodles, though.

Thank you. Bye.

We care about you.

Mm-hmm.

We did it!

Yes, we did it!

Winston: We did it.

Best rehearsal dinner ever.

You guys are a good team.

We haven't slept all week, but thanks.

I work in hospitality, it's what I do.

[Jess chuckles] I've got some cools things for tomorrow I want to show you.

Right on.

Maid of honor.

[Gasps]

Best Man.

Mayday J-Day.

What's up, Nick-knack.

We're gonna need some more hotties on the dance floor.

Copy that.

I'll get those hotties right over to you.

[Both laugh]

Awesome.

Thank you for letting us stay in your room.

Of course.

I'm sorry your mother's not coming, Cece.

Her disapproval of my son fills me with a hot rage.

I've repressed into a cyst on my back.

It's grotesque.

Sweet dreams, kid.

Night, Mom.

Good night, my mom's friend Susan.

Are you guys sure that you don't want to use the air mattress?

We sleep together.

We've been lovers since 1998.

[Laughs]

I want to thank everyone for an amazing rehearsal dinner.

Special shout out to Winston For a shockingly good toast.

[All applaud]

Winston!

Insanely good.

Dipping in and out of French.

Powerful stuff, man.

Yay!

No.

Blessings, blessings on all your households.

All right, I think it's time to get the bride and the groom to sleep in separate beds like boy cousins.

Wait, wait, can we just say good night first?

[Whispers]: We'll allow it.

[Normal voice]: We'll allow it.

[Moaning softly]

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

I'm gonna do the dishes. Dishes.

Break it up!

What is this?

The last night of drama camp?

Enjoy it while you can because it gets boring.

Same old lips year after year with no spark, just d*ad tongues touching, like decayed salmon.

Oh, my god, Winston!

I did it!

The night before the wedding, A bride is bound to feel a little bit emotional, so nervous? I got Xanax.

Delicious.

Mm-hmm.

Sad, I have a picture of a cat riding a dog like a horse.

[Both chuckle]

[Jess continues chuckling]

Is that for me or for you?

What?

Hmm.

You freak out, you want to escape to Canada?

I've got our passports and...

Trudeau pics. [Whistles]

I'm good, you know? I don't need anything.

Really? 'Cause you can ask for anything.

After tomorrow, you're not gonna be able to use the bride card anymore.

You've got power.

[Deep voice]: Wield it.

I'm gonna go crazy doing this For you one day.

Well, Sam is the most objectively marry-able guy I've ever dated.

He's out there washing dishes right now.

Mm.

And he's so tall.

So tall.

His jacket on me looks like a garbage bag.

Check it out.

Oh.

Uh...

[Quietly]: What is this?

[Gasps]

What? What? What?

[Loud Gasp]

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

Is Sam gonna propose?

Oh, my god.

[Gasps] Oh, my god!

Nick, let me tell you something. It has been a pleasure watching you blossom into the best man.

Well, thank you for giving me the soil to grow.

Good night.

My flash drive is gone!

The flash drive your vows are on?!

No, a different flash drive!

Then what's the problem?

I was being sarcastic!

Of course the flash drive that my vows are on!

Ah...

There's my poet's fuel.

Mm, I might still be drunk from my own toast, but my god, you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday.

[Inhales deeply]

Bye.

Uh...

I'm here. I heard it.

Let's acknowledge that and, uh, you know where to find me.

It's not here. I can't find it.

I told Aly she'd make a beautiful bride someday, and then she just bounced.

I mean, why'd I say that?

We've been dating a month.

Dude, Schmidt lost his vows!

For the wedding?!

No, different vows.

Oh, so then what's the big deal?

What is wrong with you people?!

How'd I lose it?

I wear it around my neck. I even we...

I even wear it when I got a spray tan.

Winston: Ooh.

I think I know what happened.

What?

[Groans]

Is that a piece of my flash drive?

Yes, it is.

You see, earlier tonight, when we were practicing the hora...

Winston, stop trying to throw me off the chair!

That's not the game!

[All cheering]

I don't mean this anti-jewish at all, But that insane Jew dance has ruined our lives.

I'm freaking out.

It took me nine months to write those vows.

What do you remember?

Cece...

I can't believe this day is finally here.

And then...

Rick Santorum said it best when...

[Sighs] I don't... that's all I got. That's all I remember.

That's all you remember?!

My vows were like a novel.

How much of your zombie novel do you remember?

Chapter one...

"on Jack Granger's 41st birthday, he was sh*t in the face by his dog Ed."

Understand the situation that I'm in.

You are so lucky.

How-how am I lucky, Nick?

'Cause one of the greatest writers of our time is about to enter this room.

Would you like to meet him?

All right.

I'll go get him.

There's no way it's not him, right?

You think it's him?

It's me.

You know what, just 'cause he has a ring doesn't mean he's gonna propose to me tonight or right now.

[Knocking]

Hey, guys. I'm so sorry to interrupt.

Uh, Jess, I have something important I want to talk to you about when you get a chance.

Okay, yeah.

I'll be right there.

Cool PJ's.

I look like the sky.

[Both chuckle softly]

Okay.

[Whisper screaming]

This is happening now. He is going to propose.

I totally didn't see this coming.

This is great, right?

[Brightly]: Yeah.

What was that?

What was what?

You paused.

[Laughs]: I didn't pause.

You took like a huge pause.

You were like...

Longer than that!

Jess...

What aren't you saying? That's what I'm asking.

Nothing... if you want to marry Sam, I want you to!

[Gasps] You think this is a horrible idea!

You know what the truth is?

I think that you paused on the inside.

Boom.

Don't you boom me.

I boom.

First of all, neither of us should want to say boom.

That's not ever a cool thing to say.

I'll decide who says boom!

To write anything, you need to start with a big idea.

In my last Zombie novel, Uh-oh Guts, the big idea was that there were too many guts.

[Chuckles] Schmidt, you're gonna say the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Cece.

Okay.

Cece...

Uh, what a...

You're too inside the thing. I-it's not that hard.

Watch me do it.

Ooh, now we getting somewhere.

Here we go. Winnie the Bish, when you feel ready just say her name.

Her name.

I'm gonna need you to say, "Cece."

Okay, this is not working.

Cece.

Cece... Average worker.

Uneducated, but kind.

Wears shoes, boyish...

Never really talked to her.

I don't know why I'm listening to you In the first place.

You're terrible at talking to women.

Case in point: You and Reagan.

Hey, did you clean everywhere?

Are you happy?

Are you happy that you said that?

I'd like to smell your towel.

Back to the basics, Schmidt.

Okay, there's only seven types of stories.

Please, don't list them.

Nick: I'm gonna list them.

Man vs. Man, Man vs. Dog, Dog vs. Zombie, James bond, stories of kings and lords, women over 50 finding themselves after divorce, and car commercial.

My favorite is, uh, that Toyota, Uh... Ev-every... the family's in the car...

You're thinking of the food commercial.

Really? Fat boy talks to idiot.

Okay, eight, fat boy talks to idiot.

We're getting nowhere. Winston, I need some of that toast magic.

What do you got?

I'm sorry, but I'm done speaking from the heart. I...

Basically ruined my love life today.

Here's my advice to you.

Okay.

Keep your guard up.

Don't be too vulnerable around her.

What?

Be standoff-ish, close yourself.

When she looks at you, cross your arms.

Turn your back on her.

Whoa, whoa.

For wedding vows, that's terrible advice.

Yeah... I get it, But you don't really, like, know how she feels.

Did I do it?

[Laughs]

Did he do it?

[Laughs]

[All laughing]

Okay...

All right.

You're welcome.

[Laughing]

[all laughing]

That was terrible, Winston!

Slow down, take a breath, Why don't we just talk about it and figure out what you want?

No, that's what I always do.

I talk and I talk.

Not this time.

I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

Push through the panic And I'm gonna...

Say yes.

[Gasps] Really?

I'm gonna go get proposed to.

Okay, look, well, if you start freaking out and you need anything, just holler, okay?

I will not need anything from you!

If you get chilly, here's a blanket that I knitted you.

It took me all year.

[deep breath]

Sam?

You left your jacket in my room.

Oh, thanks.

So, uh, we finally, get a...

Moment alone here.

Yes. One moment.

One momentous moment.

I, uh... Know the timing of this is... Really crazy... [Sighs] and, uh... Jess...

God, I'm so nervous.

Um.

Jess, would you...

True American!

What?

Um, hey, guys, everybody out here!

We're playing true American!

Cece, I'm hollering! I'm hollering!

Schmidt: We can't play true American.

Winston: It's so late already.

No, we can't play... There's no time.

[whispering]: Help me.

We're gonna play true American because I want to.

I'm using my bride card!

The bride has spoken.

Tonight we celebrate the brides!

It's True America First ladies edition!

We can't play true American.

We have to, it's for Cece.

Fine.

We play fast, sober, then back to work.

Who the hell have I become?!

Let's do it.

Okay!


The kitchen is Michelle's garden, the bathroom is Mary Todd Lincoln's sanitarium, and as always...

The floor is lava! Let's go! One, two, three, four!

All: Drink, drink!

Hey... Oh.

Seneca Falls Convention!

Women only!

That means you, Cece.

Sorry.

Sam was reaching for the ring and I freaked out.

How do you know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone?

You just know.

I don't know. I can't put it into words.

Try! There are a lot of words out there, just pick some of them.

Everything inside of me just said, "yes."

I just looked at him.

You know, I just had this feeling that I was home.

That is very beautiful...

And very, very vague and not helpful at all.

I do know you can't avoid Sam all night.

Coach: Guess who's back?

All: Coach!

[Laughing]: It's me.

Coach!

Yeah.

I thought you got in tomorrow.

I got on a plane, Dropped may off at the hotel And now I'm ready to party!

I had six wines on the plane!

I call Coach on my team!

Both: Coach on our team!

There's only one way to solve this.

Go behind the iron curtain.

You guys ready? One, two, three.

Sam: We got the same number!

That probably means something, right?

No, no, no, no, no.

All: Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

[Sighs and whistles]

[clears throat]

I feel like...

Like you've been avoiding me.

Winston: Good to have you back, Coach!

What are you doing?

Here I am.

Oh, I'm gonna throw up!

Coach: Where y'all going?

I'm gonna throw up!

Hi.

You gonna barf?

[heaves]

I muffed us!

[Sighs]

I muffed us straight to the moon!

I can never write my vows right now, I can barely even spell my own name.

"S", jeans...

Is that right?

Is "jeans" not a letter?

It feels like a letter to me.

Schmidt, this is...

I-I know it's something, is it not a letter?

This is all my fault.

I'm supposed to be your best man.

I screwed you, Schmidt.

I screwed you!

[Sighs] I was just trying to make Cece happy.

It's all I want.

It's all I ever want to do is just to make her happy.

Wait a second, say that again.

I screwed you.

Why would you go to that?

No, about making her happy.

All I want to do is make Cece happy?

[snaps fingers] There it is.

There's your big idea.

There's my big idea.

Yeah. To make her happy.

Both: That's it, that's it.

There's my big idea!

All I want to do is make Cece happy!

There it is!

"Jeans" isn't a letter!

[Laughs] Jeans is pants!

[Laughing]: Yeah.

Okay, Winnie, you said, "bride," to a girl you've been dating for a month?

I think it's sweet, shut up, Cece.

Shut up!

You shut up!

I miss you so much.

Oh, my god, I missed you.

Like, for real, missed you.

It's crazy being in New York 'cause I'm like, "Where's Cece?"

Right?!

Like I was saying, I don't know why I said it, it just came out, And I went from the happiest to the saddest person I've ever been in 15 seconds.

I just need to be cooler around her.

Coach, this is where you come into play.

I need your help, man.

I'm tired of being a sweetie pie.

No more talking.

Winston: This part of the game, Coach?

Heavy.

Why are we out here?

This is nice.

Oh!

Dude.

Hey, man.

How are you gonna ask me to help you play games with Aly, man?

You don't want that.

Be who you are.

Now, the only way to find out why she left, Is to go over there and ask her.

Now.

Yeah, but...

Just do it!

I don't yell in New York because everyone yells there And it's less meaningful, but I will yell here.

Now push the button.

God.

You really don't yell in New York?

Dude, I'm always in a museum.

Oh, my goodness.

I'm always in a museum.

So that's basically how you play true American.

Yeah, it makes no sense whatsoever.

Oh.

Look, I'm just gonna get this over with.

Um...

Jess, I want to break up...

I can't marry you.

With you.

Oh.

What?

So...

I really can't marry you.

No, I get it. You're in love with Diane.

She's beautiful, she's your best friend, you're both doctors.

This morning, I... I went to drop her off at the airport, and I just... I just couldn't let her go, and it made me realize that I...

I just... I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and, you know, uh, it's hard to express the feelings in words.

Really?! Really?

Why can no one put this into words?

I'm-i'm so sorry about the timing.

I just... I didn't want you to have to cut my photo out of all the, you know, wedding pictures.

And then with Winston's toast, with the... All the talk about honor and integrity and the gig economy, I just...

Can we just wait to tell people?

I... I don't want to make it about me before the wedding.

Of course.

Thanks.

Hey, I hope...

I hope Diane really likes the ring.

What ring?

The ring in your jacket pocket.

I don't have a ring in my jacket pocket.

I have a ring in my jacket pocket.

Yeah.

This isn't mine.

"To Susan. Love Louise."

Oh, my god, it's engraved?

How did I miss this?

And the font is huge.

So Schmidt's mom and her girlfriend are getting married.

They're what?

Ma?

Ma?!

Are you proposing to your friend Susan?

Ma?!

Oh, Winston, now's really not a good time.

I know saying the word "bride" to you was a little crazy, But let me just explain myself, okay?

What I meant to say is that you're beautiful.

Every day with you is so much better.

Your brain is banging.

The skin-bag it comes in ain't too bad either.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

You know what, except that I'm not sorry, okay?

Because this is who I am.

No, Winston, I have food poisoning.

Yeah, I don't know who let Nick's mute park friend cook dinner for 20, but I want to find and throw up on them.

That's why you left.

Why didn't you just tell me?

Because I don't like being vulnerable.

It was stupid of me. I'm sorry.

I...

I...

I love you, you maniac.

You love... You love me?

I love you.

I love you, too.

Wow, that feels so good to say.

I love you.

I love you.

I love you.

I love you.

I... Love... You.

[groans] How is there anything left?

[Groaning]

You okay?

[Retching]

Jess: So sorry for ruining your engagement.

I'm sure you didn't plan a joint celebration with a man wearing a beer can crown and pillows on his shoes.

Jealous 'cause I'm the true American.

We're sorry we left the ring in your room.

That's what we get for fooling around in your bed.

Susan: Something about those high ceilings.

We just like tossing each other around.

Jess: Hello! Hey, quick show of hands, god.

Who's had sex in Winston's room?

Well, I've had sex in your room.

I know.

What?!

Everyone's had sex in my room?

I got weird in there.

I've gotten weirder in there than you have.

Really?

Those pillows.

There's just, Like, extra, like...

Pressure.

Schmidt: If you don't mind, I'd like to say A few words about my mom and my mom's...

My mom's friend Susan.

My mom's friend Susan.

God, you guys, let me talk.

Look, Susan, I know I never fully accepted you.

I just... I didn't know how long you were gonna be around.

And, also, you used to call my mom the Big Ragoo and me the Little Ragoo, and I couldn't make any sense of it.

But... You're a part of our family now.

To my mom... And my mom.

Yeah!

Cheers! Cheers.

Cheers. Yeah, cheers.

Cheers.

Opa.

Yeah!

Aw.

Mwah.

Mmm.

Cece?

[Sighs]

Babe, what's wrong?

It's just that you're gonna have two moms at the wedding, and I'm not even gonna have one.

I really thought that... I really thought that She would just show up last-minute 'cause she would know how happy it would make me.

[Sniffles] I don't know why I'm crying in here.

Jess' room is meant for sex.

I know. Come here.

[Sniffles]

So, Just-just h*t lobby and let technology do its thing.

Yeah, cool. When-when I get in there, I'll just h*t lobby.

Cool.

Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?

Oh, I don't know.

Come on, Jess. You know.

No, I don't.

Yes, you do. I mean, I know.

You do? Then what is it?

You know.

No, I-I don't know.

What-what is it?

It's Nick.

Here we go.

Peter.

That's Sam's favorite male nurse.

He's gotten him two years in a row for secret Santa, and last year, he got him $500, and this year, he got him crayons.

All over the map, that Peter.

So, when you get to Sam's birthday party, is the goal to impress his friends with how much you know about them or to terrify them?

I just want them to like me.

Finally, I feel like I'm in an adult relationship. He's a grown-up.

Hey, Jess, heads up, I borrowed your towel.

Use your own towel if you're gonna shower.

No, I didn't shower, I just sponged off.

Ew. Ugh! That's even worse.

You didn't even get clean before you used the towel.

It's called a French whore's bath.

You wouldn't make a dime as a French whore.

You would make zero dollars.

I'd make millions, millions.

Bonjour. Croissant. Millions.

Definitely not.

No.

That's disrespectful. Here.

[Jess and Cece scream]

Happy Bird Day, Dr. Sam.

Wow, you didn't have to do that.

Did you say, "Bird Day"?

You heard me. Well, you know, I figured Jess likes you, so I like you, too, man.

Welcome to the family.

H-Hey, look at that.

It's a shirt with a whole lot of birds on it.

That's a bird shirt. Bird shirt.

What? Why? What-what's the...?

Ah, you know why.

Cool shirt, dude.

[chuckles]

We're bird bros now.

And check it out, you can wear it to the party.

You know, nothing says, "This dude is dope," like a motherflippin' finch, am I right?

[laughs]

Schmidt: Sam, I'm so sorry I won't be able to attend your party.

I have wedding stuff.

"Stuff"?

Define "stuff."

Things.

Thank you.

I'm so excited to meet your friends, including Dr. Garfinkel...

[laughs]

Sam, I love the way you laugh.

You never open your mouth.

You're always like...

[mimics Sam's laugh]

I don't sound like that. [laughs]

No, you do. You just did it.

[phone chimes]

Hey, you got to add a flash card.

My friend Diane's coming.

She's in town for a podiatry conference.

She's a friend from med school.

Oh, I've never heard you mention her.

You guys close?

Diane!

Hi.

[both laugh]

They look... close.

Hi!

It's so good to see you.

So good to see you.

Way too close.

[both laughing]

♪

Hey, Schmidt, how many robots are too many robots?

Hi, Nick.

Gavin.

What are you doing here?

I thought you'd be at Sam's party.

What's he doing here?

Well, after the incident where my dad kissed... [heaving]

If you're gonna barf, just barf. It's not healthy to hold it in.

Where my dad kissed Jess, there was an accidental pocket dial that actually went pretty well.

He suggested some wine tasting for the wedding, and I said, "Why not?"

You're just gonna drink alone with your dad?

Join us, Nick, the Pinot from my vineyard is dynamite this year.

It's gonna taste fantastic at my son's wedding in a factory.

Gavin, it's actually a slaughterhouse, and you would know that if you were around more.

[pounds table] Can I see you in my room for a second, please?

Look, I know you don't trust my dad, but I'm happy that he's here.

We're working through stuff.

Wait, Schmidt, I want you to have a relationship with your father.

I really do, but I've been down this road so many times.

He just shows up out of the boo, and then all of a sudden expects...

It's "blue," it's "blue."

Well, thanks, Eye-stein.

He shows you a great time, you get sucked in, then he disappears and breaks your heart, and I'm left to pick up the pieces.

My dad's taking me to...

Miss Saigon tonight!

And I'm not gonna get hurt.

My dad never showed up.

He didn't?

It hurts so bad!

You want a milkshake, cowboy?

It's different now.

I've heard that before.

We're seeing Jersey Boys!

Wait, this is your dad we're talking about!

And he's different now, Nick.

[crying]: He's the same!

I didn't have ice cream, so I just really shook up some milk.

I'm older and I'm wiser, and I'm not gonna get sucked in.

We're gonna taste some wine, and then I'm gonna send him on his way.

But, Nick, I'm plead... I'm asking you... just be nice to him.

All right, man. I will.

If it means that much to you, of course, I'll do it.

Thank you.

But if it goes poorly, I'm not putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.

Am I Humpty Dumpty?

Yeah. I'm just not doing it again.

You won't have to.

Also, nowhere in that rhyme does it say he's an egg.

He's most definitely an egg, Nick.

So, what kind of king uses all those resources to put together one egg?

It's a parable.

Humpty Dumpty is the king.

Who told you that?

[laughing]

I've never seen him laugh like that.

[both laughing] What do I do?

Think of it this way: you're a dog, he's a f*re hydrant, you pee on him, girl.

Yeah.

There you go.

I'm gonna go lift a leg on him.

There you go!

Hey.

Oh, hey.

So, Sam said he spilled on the bird shirt and he had to take it off.

He's putting on a brave face, but, poor thing, I know he is just crushed.

Babe.

What, babe?

He doesn't like the shirt.

No, babe.

Yeah, babe.

No, babe.

Yeah, babe.

No... babe.

Yeah... babe.

No, babe.

Yeah, babe.

No... babe.

Yeah... babe.

No.

Yeah.

Babe.

Sam, do you remember in med school when we got drunk and sewed fins on that d*ad guy?

[both laugh]

We made a merman!

[laughs]

Hey, Sam, remember the other night when you ate all that bad crab and, uh, you said, "Not tonight," and I said, "Yeah, tonight," and then you said, "No, not tonight," and then the next night, when you were feeling better, remember what we did?

We... we had sex?

Had sex!

[Jess laughs]

The kind where you need a snack after.

Hey-o!

[clears throat]

Whoa.

So, Jess, you're from Portland. Do you, do you miss it?

[coughing] Do you miss Portland?

I mean, I feel like you never really...

[Jess coughing]

You... are you okay?

Oh, my God, are you choking?

Is that what this is? Oh, my God, stand up!

Stand up, stand up!

Get up, come here.

Oh!

[coughs]

Here, sit down.

[coughing]

Thank you, Diane.

You saved me.

Any time.

[sighs]

Um, hey, Diane, um, would you like to go to the ladies' room and freshen up?

Yes, Jess, I would love to.

I am so sorry.

I'm really... I'm-I'm embarrassed.

Please, for what?

No, I am.

For marking your territory? Look, I get it.

But I was acting childish and dumb and jealous, and-and I...

I see why Sam likes you.

Well, I see why he likes you, too.

Will you forgive me?

I have guy friends, and I don't know why I would just assume that you're wildly in love with him.

Oh, no, I am.

[laughs]

No, really, I am.

[laughs]

Seriously, I am.

[laughs]

Jess, I'm-I'm in love with Sam.

[whispers]: Oh, b*lls.

Now this varietal gained prominence in the '30s as an Italian driving wine.

Now they call it a picnic wine, but we know what they're up to.

But as they say, "Wine is fine, but bourbon is schwervin'."

I think I got a buzz.

Yeah, me too.

Hang on.

Uh, you're gonna like this.

How much hooch do you have stored in this place, you mountain person?

Prohibition happened once.

Nick and Gavin: It can happen again.

Yeah.

It was pretty easy to see where you were going with that.

Look at the two of you.

Bonding over the thing that numbs you.

[Nick and Gavin laugh]

Smell this. Smell this.

Oh!

Let me get a whiff. Let me get a whiff.

Oh!

Hurts so good.

Sam.

Guess who the luckiest boy in the world is?

It's you.

It's an extra bird shirt, huh?

I keep an extra one in my car, just in case I get interviewed on television.

Oh. Thank you.

Put on the bird shirt, Sam.

I will.

When?

When I don't have to take my other shirt off in a bar full of people.

Ten years?!

Yeah.

You didn't tell him for ten years?

I did.

Well, I tried to.

Um, our second year of med school, he went to work with Doctors Without Borders.

Well, so I didn't, I didn't know when I was gonna see him again, and, um, one night, I-I just sat down and wrote him a letter.

[gasps]

And everything came out, you know, everything that I was feeling, everything that I had been holding back.

Yeah. I love letters.

I know, me too.

We have so much in common.

Arguably too much.

Mm.

But keep going.

Well... Sam never responded.

[scoffs]

I just figured he didn't want to embarrass me, you know?

I mean, I-it's hard when you're friends with a guy first.

So... he came home, and we just kept on like normal, and it was really painful, but I-I couldn't lose him as a friend.

Of course you couldn't.

Then... last week, this came in the mail.

[gasps]

"Return to sender."

He never got it.

Oh, my God.

Yeah.

He never knew how you felt.

No, and I-I came here tonight to give him this letter and then...

What happened?

I met you.

Oh, right.

Me.

Mm.

Here.

I can't throw it away, but I can't give it to him.

Don't worry, Jess, you... you didn't do anything wrong.

I'm not the one for Sam.

You are.

I'm gonna be really honest.

Um, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.

That was the most romantic story I've ever heard.

And I don't want to get between them.

Or do I?

I love Sam, and I don't want to throw it all away because she couldn't figure out how to buy a Forever stamp.

Just because you give Sam this letter, it does not mean that he's automatically gonna choose Diane.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

[scoffs] Damn it.

Look at them.


♪ Moon river ♪
♪ Wider than a mile ♪
♪ I'm crossing you in style... ♪

This song isn't even on our jukebox.

You know what, that's it.

I'm-I'm not losing Sam because I'm some dumb romantic.

Cece, get rid of this letter.

Lett'r done.

Good-bye, Diane.

Go back to fixing feet, you sweet saint of a woman.

You must be so proud of me.

I'm finally being practical and realistic, and not some moony-eyed freak who's seen too many romantic comedies.

I'm basically being you.

Not anymore, pal.

Schmidt's made me weak in my stupid knees.

I don't know.

This past year with Schmidt's changed me.

It's made me believe in love stories.

Is that why you were crying during the bank commercial where the two old people were texting each other?

Jessica...

I know.

They now have the money that they need...

No, I know... to be buried together.

[laughs]

We both know that you're not gonna be able to live with yourself if you don't give this letter to Sam.

Yeah.

What if I lose him?

Well, then you'll at least know, babe.

It's not your love story.

Oh.

I have something to tell you.

The old man in the bank commercial, um, played a n*zi in Schindler's List.

Does that change anything?

Schmidt: I made a model of our wedding venue.

Nick: Wow.

Your wine is so good, I really want to showcase it and-and put the bar here.

It's where they store the drums of wild chemicals, but I'm pretty sure they're empty now.

Yeah, it's empty except for the big puddle that never dries.

Gavin: Oh, it'll be fine.

With your mother there, that puddle will get drunk.

How about we grab some dinner?

[chuckles] Together?

You...

Yeah, no, I'd like that very much.

I'm gonna run home.

Obviously, I can't wear these shoes to dinner.

Ha, can you imagine?

I'll see you.

I'm going to dinner with my dad.

[door closes]

This is so great, man.

Yeah, it's great.

You guys are finally getting along.

You were like, "We've been down this road."

It's great. I just want to check in.

Y-You said you weren't gonna get sucked in, and it seems like you're getting sucked in.

Sucked in? I'm not getting sucked in.

If anybody's getting sucked, it's just me sucking myself in.

No, I know how that sounded.

Yeah.

But you, I mean you...

You good?

Yeah.

Yeah.

[door closes]

Hey, uh, Gavin, hold up.

Um... I feel like I can say this to you because, well, you know, we shared a cup.

You really live by a specific code.

Look, we both know how this is gonna go down, Gavin.

You're gonna get Schmidt's expectations up, and then you're gonna bail.

I know.

Just be better.

Be his dad.

Just be there for him, even when it's not fun, and sometimes it's really not fun.

I know.

I've been doing it for 15 years.

Thank you.

Don't thank me.

Just promise me if you show up for dinner tonight, you'll show up tomorrow and the day after and the week after, and basically forever.

I will be there.

Will you, Gavin?

Will you?

Will you, Gavin?

I will.

Will you?

Will you, Gavin?

You're really dragging this out.

No, I've already gone through everything I had rehearsed.

I really thought the elevator would be here by now.

We could talk about other stuff.

Can we, Gavin?

Can we?

Yeah.

[elevator bell dings]

Can we, Gavin? Oh, thank God.

I'm getting my birthday present at an airport hotel?

Oh, my God, are you taking me on a trip to meet my birth mother?

Oh.

No, wait. [laughs]

Um, no.

Uh, it's, uh... I have a surprise for you, but it's not exactly a present.

Um, just wait here.

Okay.

Look, I want you to know that no matter what happens, no-no matter how this turns out... and by "this," you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about...

I want you to be happy.

And I want you to be happy.

But what did you want me to be before this moment?

Don't let me get a ticket, okay?

Jess?

Tell Sam.

He-he deserves to know how you feel.

Wow, you are either really cool or really cocky.

You are either really cool or really cocky.

Thank you.

[knocking]

I should've been more clear. He's downstairs.

I just want to let you know, my shift is up, so Jason will be getting bummed out by you for the rest of the night.

Somebody order a milkshake, cowboy?

Well, Nick, you were right.

I got sucked in.

He was a car wash vacuum, and I was just a stray pistachio.

Listen, Schmidt, it's my fault.

I got real with him and he split.

It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.

And, Nick?

Yeah?

Thank you.

Thanks for what?

For being there.

What are you doing right now?

[groans loudly]

Yeah, man.

I like red meat.

Yeah, yeah, no, beef.

Sexy ladies.

Boobs.

Moobs.

B-Boobs.

Big boobs.

Yeah.

Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.

Oh, don't, don't, don't!

Wait! Wait, guys, wait.

I know I should have been here an hour ago, but I was at the warehouse getting your security deposit back.

Why would you...

Let me finish, trust me.

That slumlord wouldn't give it to me unless I cleaned the place, and once I started...

I don't know if you know, but I'm a little OCD.

Me, too.

Yeah, it runs in the family.

Your grandfather had to touch every lamppost he passed.

He couldn't hold a job.

Until he got a job as a lamppost repair man.

Why wouldn't you just call?

Oh, I got kicked in the back of the head by some kids who were using that dump as a place to practice their urban dancing.

They-they were honestly pretty good, until they b*at me and took my phone.

And my wallet and my watch.

I had to run over here... well, actually it was... it was more of a... a walk-jog.

I threw up once.

I'm not very good at doing the right thing when it comes to you.

But I wanted to start tonight.

You are not getting married at that slaughterhouse.

Okay, well, then where am I getting married?

At my vineyard.

If you want.

It'll be beautiful.

I talked to Cece.

She said it's up to you.

I just want you to know, either way, I'm all in from here on out.

We're getting married at a vineyard.

Yes! Yes.

Getting married at a vineyard.

Gavin: Yes.

Yes, yes.

So, you just left him there to talk?

Yep, I abandoned my own car, and now, for all I know, Sam and Diane are tearing apart a business-friendly hotel room together.

Well, I'm really proud of you.

I know that it was hard, but it's the only way you're gonna find out what you need to know.

Thanks.

This might sound like a cry for help, but I promise you it's not.

Um, I'm gonna go to my room and I'm gonna watch videos of dogs waiting for their d*ad owners to come back.

Mm-hmm.

Cece, you want to know what I think?

Mm, not really.

I think there are people who get bird shirts, and there are people who don't.

Jessica Day needs to be with a bird shirt person.

Am I a bird shirt person?

Oh, Cece, why do you always have to make things about you?

[knocking at door]

Sam, hello.

[kisses]

I forgive you.

Okay. Okay.

Is Jess here?

She is.

[dog whining over laptop]

Hey.

Hey. [chuckles]

Hey.

I'm just, uh...

Yeah, I'm really nervous, so I'm just gonna ask you an innocuous question.

Um... did you bring my car back?

Yes, I have got your keys right here.

Thanks.

Look, what you did for me today was... the most selfless thing anyone has ever done for me.

Whatever... if there was ever a time for me and Diane, it's passed.

And when I read the letter, it just reminded me how much that's true.

[chuckles]

Now that I know you like letters, watch out.

I have to say, that was the strangest birthday surprise I have ever been given.

Well, Winston took my bird shirt idea, so...

[laughs]

You know what, one of these days, I'm gonna get you to laugh with your mouth open.

I know you will. That's what she said.

No, that's not gonna do it.

That's what she said.

You just said the same thing.

[Italian accent]: Now that's what she said.

That's... What accent is that?

It's Italian.

Oh, really?

That's what she said!

Nope, that didn't do it, either.

That's what she said.

Now you're just changing the stress.

That's what she said?

Maybe you should stop.

[laughs]

Jess: That's what she said. Ooh.

Sam: Ooh. That was closer.





J'accuse, Parikh!

Cette soupe est trop chaude.

You just said, "I accuse you," and, "the soup is too hot"?

Indeed, it is.

I told you you could see your wedding dress when I'm finished with it.

Hey.

Hey, hey, guys, she's writing something.

Okay.

Okay.

All right, that's something.

What's going on?

Yeah, but that was two months ago, and I need it by tomorrow night, Because I have to decide on my hair, on my jewelry...

Honey, honey, I am almost done with it.

So you got rid of the mirrors?

[laughing]: Definitely.

The battery pack?

Oh, yeah.

The little weird jacket that makes me look like I'm in a street g*ng from the future?

All that crap's gone.

I'll have it to you by tomorrow night.

It's a guarantee.

Okay. [chuckles]

I'm screwed.

I can't believe

I got to spend a whole day without noodling you like this.

If anyone finds out we're together, they're not gonna let us be partners.

So...

Before we figure out what this is...

Just be normal, okay?

No kissing, no touching, no doing that sex bark you do.

[whines]

I said not to do it.

[whines twice]

[laughs]

And also no doing that song you made up about squeezing me tight.

♪ Gonna squeeze you tight ♪
♪ So wrong it's right ♪

[laughs]

♪ Gonna fly the kite... ♪

Sorry, I know that's your thing.

I did not know she was here.

I did.

We have a situation.

I want to ask Reagan to the wedding, so I-I sent her a text to say, "Hey, how's your spring looking?"

That was an hour ago. No response.

Mm.

d*ad. Maybe she's d*ad.

Yeah.

Maybe-maybe she doesn't miss me, or maybe she forgot me.

How could she forget me after I gave her my body?

I thought you guys didn't have sex.

Uh, outercourse.

It counts.

Cece, I need you to send Reagan a text and if she responds, Then we'll know that she's at least alive... and ignoring me.

No, I'm not getting involved.

[whispering]: Cece...

Send the text.

That was terrifying.

Wow, that voice is giving me gooseflesh.

Mm, okay, fine, I'll do it.

[whispering]: Thank you very much.

You're welcome?

It's so easy; she's like a puppet.

I can hear you.

You know that, right?

Yeah.

Just say thank you.

Thank you.

Get some sleep, kid.

You know what, Jess...

Is this the dress?

This can't be the...

You told Cece it was almost done.

I know! I choked under the pressure.

I spent all last night trying to cr*ck it.

Nothing.

I can't make you beautiful unless you let me in!

[screaming]

I've never procrastinated like this.

Well, what a fun, low-stakes time to try new things.

I'm freaking out.

I've been working on this for months.

It's just...

It has to be perfect.

This dress is gonna be in every single picture, and people will say, "Cece, why do you look so bad?"

Also, "Who is that m*rder woman in the background?"

And the answer to both would be: Jess.

This is true. I see this happening exactly how you described it.

[screams]

Okay, could not sleep last night.

I'm too excited about the dress.

I'm ahead of schedule.

I'll have it to you this afternoon.

This afternoon?

Jess: Bye!

Oh, my God.

‭[laughs]

Ah! Why did I say that?

There was no reason for me to say that.

I can't work like this.

You have to get her out of here.

I can't take my idea walks.

Your idea walks? How did you become such an important part of my life?

When I craft, I like to get out of my space, bop around.

I use movement and scenery to tickle the old idea box, but I can't do that now, 'cause every ten minutes Cece comes in here, like, "Hey, Jessica, that dress is gonna be gangbusters, polka dots."

That's a really good Cece.

Also a passable Sinatra.

Jess, what if I told you that there was a place...

Where you could work in peace.

Um...

Schmidt, this is the men's room at your office.

Oh, no, this is my wedding workshop.

See, I'm the only guy in the building.

Well, except, of course, for Brian but, you know, I pay Brian eight dollars a day to do his poops at the big box store across the street.

That seems high.

When do you do the work that you get paid for?

Rarely, and it's a problem, but, you know, we couldn't afford a planner, so, here we are.

Please...

Have a seat at the think sink.

Oh.

Hmm.

Don't mind if I do.

[laughs]

I like its energy.

I will create a dress today.

If you need anything, just let me know. Also...

There's a fridge stocked with sparkling water in stall three.

Jess.

Dang, girl, you ugly.

Come on, mouse, how about we don't do this today.

Bishop.

Hmm?

Your fingers really that weak?

How do you button your pants in the morning?

[officers laugh]

Honestly, Sir, with, uh, great difficulty.

[officers laughing]

You guys should see Bishop load his g*n.

It's like watching a toddler eat peas.

[officers laugh]

Fellas, come on, this is the LAPD, right?

We can't bring this city together if we're tearing each other apart.

God, you're nice.

You're so nice, Daniels.

Thanks, buddy.

Everybody smells fantastic, by the way.

Thank you.

That's really nice, thanks, Daniels.

Very nice; he is very nice.

[knocking]

You wanted to see me, Kim?

Schmidt.

Why did you copy me on all these e-mails you sent planning your wedding?

What?

Oh. [clears throat]

Darn it.

Sorry about that.

Um, Kim is actually also the name of our chef's new assistant.

"Beaming over the peony centerpieces. No chance I'll get work done today."

"fat wet beats..."

FWB.

"What about a swing theme for cocktail hour? I'll spend the day brainstorming tracks. Out."

I'm no longer with fat wet beats.

We had a few conversations and he was being a straight-up ho.

Is this what you've been doing instead of the regional brand report?

It was due three days ago.

That.

Yes.

Of course, I'm gonna have that to you in...

Why are you Sm... why you smiling... at me like that?

I'm imagining what it would be like to f*re you.

The same feeling I had when we unplugged my mother-in-law.

Beep... Beep... Beep...

Is that legal... In California?

You've been warned.

If I catch you doing anything at all related to your wedding, you are out.

Jess, Jess, you gotta get out of here.

Je-jess.

Oh, dear Lord.

So, Aly said that she wanted to keep things normal at work...

Okay.

But then she ripped me in front of everyone, dude.

Isn't ripping you what Aly does?

Yes, but we're a couple now, man.

I'm flummoxed. What should I do?

Should I say something?

No.

Don't communicate.

It's not gonna get you anywhere.

What you gotta do is you gotta follow her lead.

Gotta play the game, like I'm doing with Reagan. I'm play... hey, Cece?

Mm?

Uh, did Regan text you back yet?

In the past three minutes, no.

Son of a bi... o-okay, you know what? Plan B.

I'm texting her from my burner.

Hmm?

Why do you have a burner phone?

That's an insane question, dude.

[laughs]

That's not an answer.

A burner is crazy. Look, if Reagan had her phone, she would have texted me back.

She's probably on a plane or in a spa or...

[phone blips]

Well, she just responded.

What?!

I said, "What are you doing for dinner?"

And she just texted back, "Who dis?"

So I'm gonna text, "Who you think dis is?"

[laughs]

So now we play the waiting game.

[phone blips]

"Karen?"

She thinks I'm Karen.

Oh, yeah, I can be Karen...

And Karen's gonna get some answers.

You know, as a cop, I find this to be very disturbing.

But as a friend...

[wry chuckle]

Man, this is straight-up delicious.

Mmm!

[Winston slurping]

Oh!

[Winston laughing]

Sit much, dummy?

[laughing]: Look at her.

[laughing]

‭Thank you.

She's so stupid.

What?

What the hell was that?

Just being normal. [laughs]

That was not normal.

I'm sorry, okay?

I don't know how to act around you.

I can't kiss you.

I can't prank you.

I can't keep this bottled up.

Winnie needs an outlet.

I know, I know we're incredibly sexual people.

That's right.

But if we try...

We can keep our hands off of each other.

[wry, quiet laugh]

There is that hand I was looking for.

Good job, officer.

Yeah.

Hey, Daniels.

Hey.

Hey, guys.

TGI Thursday, am I right?

Okay.

As you were.

[sighs]

That was close.

He saw us.

Ooh, uh, P-Penelope.

Have you seen a girl wandering around?

Um, look-looks like a drawing of a best friend that an eight-year-old would make.

Jess.

Oh, Schmidt.

What?

Do you think this neckline is too risque?

No secret, your girls got b*mb.

She does, and normally, there's nothing I'd rather talk about, but Kim is on a rampage and I forgot about this fakakta report that's due.

If she finds you here helping with the wedding...

Schmidt!

Ha, ho...

You walk on cat feet, you do.

Who is this?

Who's who?

This woman between us.

There's no one else I could be talking about.

There's so many women in this office.

Who is this woman between us sitting on the couch, Schmidt?

I'm so lost.

Her.

Now I see her.

Hi.

Hi.

Jess is...

She's the new temp.

I'm Jess, the new temp.

Good, I need someone.

Come with me. Up, let's go.

Looks like you make your own jewelry.

I'm gonna tell you right now, I don't want to hear about it.

[whispering]: She's mean.

Temp! Come!

Jess, this is a disaster.

We need to get you out of here before Kim actually puts my b*lls in the jar on her desk "for Schmidt's b*lls."

We need an excuse so airtight that she'll have to let you leave.

I got it.

My mother is in grave danger.

No, she's not.

Pick up my kids.

All right, hurry up, you almost people!

[children shouting]

Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Little girl, come back!

Come back!

Sorry, I'm gonna need a minute.

I'm gonna need a minute!

[car horns honking]

I don't even know these kids!

Hey, Jess, so, you know, just-just give me something to hold onto.

Just tell me about the dress.

[children screaming]

Are you with kids right now?

[children shouting]

No, no.

[grunting]

Did you just rip that book in half?

What are you, the Hulk?

Um, yeah, you want to know something about the dress.

Right, okay, um...

It's white.

I love it, I love it.

Oh, my God, I cannot wait for tonight.

Tonight, yup.

Okay.

[chuckles] Bye.

Aah! Stop!

Um... Have you guys ever seen where your mommy works?

What do we do?

There's no way he didn't see us making out.

Okay, first of all, you need to stop freaking out, okay?

You are panicking right now, and you're causing a scene.

But listen, Daniels is the nicest guy in the world.

I'm sure if we explain to him our situation, he'll be cool.

All right. Let's go.

Okay.


Hey, buddy.

Hey, guys.

[groans] I'm so sorry that I walked in on you before, but, uh, you know, if I can be honest...

I'm super excited.

I think you guys make a great couple.

Really?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Wow.

I mean, that, uh, that means a lot.

Okay, cool.

So I take it this, you know, stays between us?

Oh, absolutely. Come on.

Are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, my gosh.

Yeah, just give me $5,000 and, uh, we're good.

What?

But you were so nice.

Oh, I am, very nice, yeah.

But I'm also a guy with a huge gambling problem, you know?

Mostly on the ponies, but last night, I lost 60 large on a big game of "I Spy."

[chuckles]

Just didn't see that tree.

What are you gonna do?

[laughs]

Yeah.

You know this is blackmail... and you're a police officer.

Oh... I am a disaster.

Should I...

Do we have a deal or do I go to the sergeant?

How do we want to...?

Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wow.

You don't own us.

You know what...

Everybody, Bishop and I are...

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Are you sure about this?

Yes.

Yeah, I've never been more sure of anything.

Hey, everyone, Bishop and I are dating.

All right?

That's right.

We are rubbing butts and we don't care who knows it.

So...

You two are hooking up.

Yes, but...

Yeah...

First of all, it's, like, so new...

I get it. I get it.

Winston is hot as hell.

Some days, I'd like to drawer this badge and hold him like a baby.

[chokes]

What?

[deep growl]

Anyway, you can't be partners while you're dating.

I'll, uh, split you and assign one of you to our floater.

What? Daniels?!

That guy tried to blackmail us.

That jelly bean? [laughs]

Nice try.

[Sergeant laughing]

Bishop, uh, can I take a picture of you eating a Popsicle?

What?

No.

Just do it.

Hey, hey, come back here!

[girl squealing]

Be careful, that has pins in it.

Jess, what the hell are you doing in here?

Well, I couldn't stop working but... help me get this dress. Uh, hey stop that.

Little girl. Come here.

Come here. Little girl.

You get over here. Jess, yank it off her.

Stay still, come on.

Yank it off her!

Wait, stop moving.

[girl laughing]

Take this dress off, young lady.

Hi, Mom.

I'm fired, aren't I?

[boy whoops, glass breaks]

Oh, my God, I can't believe we got fired.

You never had a job here.

I'm so sorry, Schmidt.

It's not your fault.

Entirely.

I knew if I took my eye off the ball, these estrogen zombies would suck out my soul, but boy, did I love working here.

I loved every one of these malnourished, high-strung sociopaths.

Do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you?

How am I supposed to marry the most perfect woman in the world if I can't give her the most perfect wedding?

How am I supposed to give Cece a dress that's not as perfect as she is?

You can't f*re Schmidt.

You... give him his job back.

That's not going to happen.

Are you sure you want to say that to the person who saw your schedule?

Who would a married woman be meeting at a hotel tonight?

My father.

Oh!

[laughs]

Well, that sounds nice.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Jess. I'm Schmidt's friend and I'm not a temp.

I teach at Banyon Canyon.

Banyon Canyon?

I tried to get my kids in there but there's been some resistance.

They're biters.

Hard to get in Banyon Canyon.

Don't know what it's worth to have a friend on the inside.

Cece! Will you help me?

I hear you walking.

Oh, um, what am I looking at here, man?

This is rock bottom.

I spent $200 on burner phones and Reagan still hasn't responded to my original text.

Why don't you just text her as yourself?

You don't think it's too late?

Only one way to find out.

All right.

What do I have to lose at this point?

I don't have any more money.

Hey, Reagan, it's Nick.

Miller.

Uh, we lived in the loft together just...

We connected and we...

Get to the point.

Not gonna send any of that.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, Reagan.

I'm gonna keep that.

Reagan, it's Nick.

Would you go to Cece and Schmidt's wedding with me?

I would love to see you.

Send.

Great!

Now you'll know, one way or the other.

[phone blips]

She just wrote back. She already wrote back.

I-I can't swipe because my thumb is a little sweaty. Will you swipe for me?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, okay, okay.

Just read it. Just read it. Okay, okay, okay.

"Um, hey, Nick, you idiot.

I know it's you texting me from these numbers."

I can't disagree. She gets me.

Um, "I'd love to come to the wedding..."

Yes! Okay, good.

Great!

"But I can't because I have to work. I miss you."

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, no, that... But, yeah.

It mean, it means that she's thinking about you, so that's... that's good.

Most "derfinitely."

I'm sorry.

No, why sorry?

This is a success.

"Derfinitely, derfinitely, derfinitely."

I'm sorry, Nick; I am.

Turn "fiddy cent" into a dollar.

Are you about to cry now?

Me? No.

You-you look like you're getting a little emotional; are you good?

I'm not at all, actually.

Do you want some tissues...

Or...

No, can I have my phone, please?

Yeah.

Do you mind leaving?

Not at all.

Thanks for the good advice.

[sighs, groans]

[Nick grunts, groans]

Here you go, sir, a little lemon, a little honey.

Be careful, it's hot now, okay?

So...

Which one of us takes the blackmailing gambling addict?

I'll take him.

Can't be worse than the job I had before this...

Photographing those idiot babies.

Uncross your eyes, you idiot baby.

[crying]

Is that why you have all those pictures of crying babies dressed as vegetables in your living room?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, that was weird.

I tell you what, uh, I'll partner with Daniels.

You would do that for me?

I'll take Daniels, yeah.

Thank you.

Of course, of course, but... it does come at a price.

Ugh... I knew you were gonna...

Here they come.

Banana cramps.

Okay, bananas are supposed to stop cramps.

Mm-mm.

Babe, how many of those have you eaten?

This many.

Oh...!

[sighs] Cece...

What are we gonna do?

It's gonna be okay, all right?

You don't need to work in that cat box, anyway.

You deserve so much better.

Thank you.

Schmidt, I got your job back.

Oh, thank Jesus.

Let's just say some kids from Banyon Canyon are gonna get bit.

Now, it's not exactly your old job...

It doesn't matter. I'll take it.

Jess... [inhales] thank you.

And, Cece, about your dress...

I should have told you before but, um...

But Jess... says that it's, uh...

That it's gorgeous.

Oh... [laughs]

Oh!

Great.

Yeah, and it just needs one final touch.

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Oh, you had me worried.

Whew! [laughs]

Why did you tell her that?

Well, because, look, I know how much this dress means to her and I...

I do think that, together, we...

Dear lord, I can't even look at this thing anymore.

I keep forgetting how awful it is.

Please, take it off of the form.

At some point, we'll figure something out.

I'd say let's burn it, but it looks completely inflammable.

Oh, my God.

[Jess gasps]

Inside out... It's...

Cece!

What's happening?

What are you talking about?

Get out! It's bad luck to see it.

It's bad luck to see it, move!

Bad luck to see...

What are you talking about?

Get out!

See what?

What?

What, is it ready?

Get-get out!

Hold up!

No!

[gasps]

It's amazing.

Yeah, if we just, you know, take up the...

We just have to bunch it up a little bit, right here.

Yeah.

[gasps]

It's perfect.

Jess...

Congratulations.

It's a dress.

We have a dress? We have a Dre... We have a dress!

Everybody, we have a dress!

Man, what are you yelling about?

We have a dress.

Cece's dress! Come see!

Let's just go do it and then it'll be over, right?

Okay, let's do it, all right.

Wow!

Not you.

Not me. Not...

Not me. Okay.

Ooh! This is...

Whatever you do, don't let Nick touch it.

I'm sure he's got lasagna all under his fingernails.

Cece [muffled]: How did you do this?

[Jess speaking low and indistinct]

Can someone at least describe it to me?

In a word, breathability.

Real funny, man.

[others conversing, muffled and indistinct]

Who knew you were a seamstress?

I guess-i guess I'll wait.

Cece [muffled]: Oh, my God! Amazing!

All: Road trip!

Nick: See you guys.

Jess: Have a good time.

Schmidt: Let's go.

We're just gonna have a chill day in.

Winston: Road trip!

Nick: Yeah!

I said, "Chill day in..." but did I mean it?

[laughs]

Wait, I thought we were having a chill day.

Oh... we are...

Oh, good... not.

Welcome to your bachelorette party 2.0.

I got... the nail polish.

Mm.

I got comfy socks.

Okay.

I have Canadian Broadcast Television's 1985 masterpiece, Anne of Green Gables.

Good ol' A.G.G.

But, oh, wait... who invited this little green chimney?

I-it's a bong.

Yeah.

Oh, scoot, once every ten years, Jessica Day likes to partake in what the Native Americans call cannabis.

That's Latin.

I like to call it Giggle Dirt.

You know, we really don't have to do this, because every time you smoke weed you almost die.

I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!

Where did you get it?

I know people... through you.

So, it's just gonna be me and Cece, uh, but I want to, you know, throw a little... gasoline on the f*re, if you know what I mean.

I have Russian nesting doll.

Uh-oh.

It's grenade.

Just looking for a little weed, Nadia.

And what the heck, throw in that bag of kettle corn, too.

Oh, scoot!

You got me a stripper?!

So, uh, you want me to sign my package, or...

Wait, I think he's just a...

A man... trying to do my job for the U.S. Postal Service, not a stripper.

Yes, I dance.

Yes, I'm sexy... but I don't do it professionally.

Now, could you please just sign here?

Your calves look like a snake swallowed a bag of ropes. You know that, right?

I'm sorry for my friend objectifying you, but in her defense, you are fine as hell.

Fine as hell!

I know you're not a stripper, but is there any way you could just take your short pants off?

Mm-hmm.

[chuckles]

Have a nice day.

Om, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

Nom, nom, nom.

Sorry.

Very sorry.

Sorry, sorry.

But we are not sorry about that.

Keep walking away there!

Oh, keep... slow... it down there for a second.

[whooping]

Ay-ay-ay.

Ooh...

[yelling grito]

[both catcalling]

Smack that! Sorry.

Ooh.

[grunts]

I think this is a gift from our registry.

Wait, don't open it!

What if I-inside of it is us, but we're older?

I've no clue what this is.

You know, Schmidt handled everything from the registry.

[scanner beeping]

Crockpot!

Kettle, kettle!

Espresso maker!

Trivet!

Melon baller!

It's a bread maker?

From... oh, from Schmidt's mom.

"Cece, this bread maker couldn't be easier to use."

"It has one button."

"Even you can do it with a few tries."

"Ha, ha, Louise."

What does that mean?!

Oh, no.

She...

Oh, no!

I mean, is she trying to say that I can't even push one button?

She doesn't think that I can take care of her precious, little boy.

She doesn't like that Schmidt does all the cooking...

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

This simple bitch wants you to be some kind of June Cleaver, Betty Draper, Carol Brady wifey?!

Mm-mm.

It is the 21st century!

Uh-huh.

Fifth generation feminism!

Keep going.

Work-life balance!

We need to rise up.

Yeah!

22% less pay for the same job?!

Don't tell me what to wax!

Sideburn where my thigh turn.

You know what we need to do to this thing?!

Bake bread in it!

Wait, wait, wait!

What, what?!

You'll do a lot more damage with this.

This is why I love you.

Homemade bread's for Europeans!

That's right!

Yeah!

U.S.A.!

Both: U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

Oh, my God, I just realized some day I'm gonna have to speak at my mother's funeral.

Wow.

U.S.A.!

U.S.A.!

[phone ringing]

U.S.A.! - U.S.A.!

Oh, wait... hey!

We're coming up on the rental place right now.

I just got an e-mail notification that our first wedding gift has arrived.

Oh, y-you did?

Spoiler alert, it's a bread maker.

Bread maker.

Cece, do me a favor and bring it inside.

It's in the hallway right now.

Yeah, I'll-I'll go...

I'll go get the... the bread maker and bring it inside, in one piece, safe and sound.

I love you so much, I got to go.

Schmidt, Nick, Winston: Bread maker!

[phone beeps off]

This was shipped like this so we are gonna need a new one.

You obviously broke this yourself.

Uh...

[laughs]

You obviously broke it yourself.

Yup.

No.

[Jess laughs]

You crushed it with your mind.

Okay, you're calling me a witch?

You just have magical powers, you don't like...

I don't know how I can help you today.

It's like that episode of... remember that episode?

Yeah.

Of that... yeah.

[sighs]

So...

Okay, so, like, um... how-how much would it... would it be to replace it?

It's $1,200.

Is there a store in the mall that sells $1,200 for, like, $50?

How is this thing so expensive?

Jess: Aly!

What are you doing here?

Seriously?

We just had this conversation outside the mall.

Hey.

Jess: Aly!

What are you doing here?

You don't... remember that?

No, no, I do, I do.

You don't, do you?

I don't.

[Jess laughs]

I don't.

I do.

Really?

No.

Okay.

It's Cece's bachelorette party.

Yeah...

It's Cece's bachelorette party.

Oh, yeah.

You do remember it?

No. [laughs]

Don't remember it?

Mm-mm.

Anyway... this is my super present boyfriend, Tripp.

I'm sorry, he's dealing with a very important work crisis right now, since he's an agent for animal actors.

Fine, fine!

Hire Colonel Fantastic instead of Maurice.

You want to walk onto Alfonso Cuarón's set and tell him that he lost his lead otter, be my-be my guest, okay.

Who's gonna get her in the water with Naomi Watts?

Colonel Fantastic?

Yeah, right.

It's my fifth year anniversary of being a cop and he's supposed to make me dinner... if he ever gets off the phone.

Hey, babe, I need a left-handed spatula, okay?

Don't tell me it's not a thing; it's a thing.

Soul mates do exist.

[laughs]

What a wang.

[both chuckle]

You know what?

Hmm?

[gasps]

I'm gonna tell Aly that Winston's in love with her!

No, Winston would k*ll you.

Okay, I'll just text Winston and I'll get him up to speed on Aly and Tripp.

[humming]: Nailed it.

Excuse me, are you actually gonna buy something?

Yeah, we need to buy another bread maker, 'cause you claim we "destroyed" this one "with a stick."

I never said stick and we're out of stock.

Well, maybe that's what you said.

You destroyed this thing with the stock.

Is that what you did?

You b*at this with a stick?

No, I didn't, I said you said... you said stick.

But I didn't say stick.

I never said stick.

I don't even have a stick.

I live downtown.

Well, we're-we're out of stock, so...

But you-you have one right there.

[gasps]

Oh... that's the floor model.

Can't sell the floor model.

Yes, you... it's right there.

It's right there.

We need it to sell other bread makers.

You just said you don't have other bread makers.

I don't make the rules.

Who makes the rules?

Derek.

[inhaling]

Definitely too high No, I cannot deal to talk to Derek. with Derek right now.

Okay, I have a really good plan, all right?

We just leave this here and then we go do something different.

Jessica, that is the first thing that Schmidt and I own together and I ruined it.

I have to do something.

I have to replace it.

For the love of mack daddy, why can't you be cool?

Shut it!

You're in my house now.

Calm down, sir, your house is clearly a lost and found.

Jess: And it's all just baby shoes... and babies don't even need shoes.

Why not put that money towards something worthwhile like a cute hat or a raincoat?

[laughing]: A baby in a raincoat.

It's like... just like a... a little baby meteorologist.

[laughs]

Hey, so, it's this simple, okay.

We wanted to pay for the bread maker, but they wouldn't let us pay for it because it was a floor model, so we had a plan... I don't care.

[laughs] [lock clicks]

[laughs]

Baby in a raincoat.

[Jess laughing]

This is bad, you guys. This is really bad!

He's gonna call the real cops and I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

I could lose my job... or worse...

[gasps]

They put me on train duty.

I'm so sorry we got you in this situation, okay.

I am so sorry, too.

Okay, how do we get out of here?

How, how? Before the cops come.

Oh!

Yes, okay, guys, here's how we get out of here.

We dress up in the clothes from the lost and found, and we start crying, and then he comes back in and he's like, "Where are the girls?"

This is just babies in here."

You're incredibly high.

No.

Yeah.

No.

Mm-hmm.

No. No.

Yeah.

Who?

You. You, babe.

How did you know?

Oh, I knew from the first second I saw you.

Like, literally the first second.

Okay, ideas, you, go.

Oh, no, no, no, I am not giving you any ideas because it was my idea that got us into this mess in the first place.

First...

I bashed Schmidt's $1,200 bread maker.

$1,200?

Yeah.

For a bread maker?

I know.

That's a lot of dough.

I'm trying to wink.

Am I winking?

Then I got my best friend here to commit a crime, and now you might have... train duty?

It's like marathon duty but without the hot guys pooping their pants.

What does that say about me if I can't even take care of a bread maker?

What if Louise was right?

What if I can't take care of Schmidt?

How can you say you don't take care of people?

You've been taking care of me my entire life.

You're fierce and you are strong, and you would stand up for anyone that you love.

You're like a big, scary mama bear.

I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!

[grunting]

Jess: Ah...

[Jess laughing]

I'm okay.

[sighs]

You're my mama bear, girl.

Oh...

I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.

[whispering]: Oh, don't.

[whispering]: You do.

I just... I've been a cop for five years and...

You do.

Jessica!

I just wanted to celebrate it, [mouthing] but then Tripp had to leave to meet an owl for sushi.

An owl he sent a basket of mice to at Christmas, who I'm pretty sure has a nicer house than me.

[gasps] Let me tell her... please!

[door opens]

I'll blame it on being stoned.

Stoned?

You're stoned?

That makes this a drug case.

Okay, yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.

Wait, no, I made a mistake.

You better get comfortable, you're gonna be here for a long time, lady!

A long time!

What are you doing with that window?

You letting a bee out? That's dope, man.

N-N-N-N-N-No. We're escaping. We're not fighting those guys.

What?

I thought you s-said that we're going to meet them outside?

Uh, yeah.

And they believed it. It's a great trick.

It's how the Millers have never had to pay for a ham.

We're escaping? How-how is that butch, Nick?

Enough with the butch stuff, Schmidt.

You got to let this Toby thing go.

If I freaked out every time somebody yelled at me, I...

It's not because I got yelled at.

It's because I got yelled at in front of Cece.

You know, I know she can handle herself, but I need to prove to myself that I can defend her from the lunatic pagans of the world.

Because if I can't, what kind of husband am I going to be?

I understand if you don't want any part of this, but this is something I have to do.

For me.

[sighs]

Okay. I'm in.

If you got to do it, then I got your back.

There's two of them, there's two of us.

We can do this.

Why is that little boy not in a day care?

We gotta do something, Schmidt.

Schmidt!

This is Nick! Nick! Schmidt!

You know what would be a good plan?

You get a job at a Raisin Bran factory, right?

You start stealing all of the raisins, okay? You follow?

Then you hydrate those raisins to make them turn back into grapes, and you sell the grapes.

There's no overhead, and you make you a very rich man.

That's right, Wilson.

You have surrendered to the night.

When things started escalating, I just rolled up into a little ball like an armadillo.

Fellas, can I get real for a second?

I was thinking about Aly the entire time.

This is one of her barrettes.

You know, women use barrettes to keep their hairs in different styles. Yeah.

But Aly uses this to pin her hair up when she's on duty.

And I kept it.

[chuckles] That's how pathetic I am.

That's not pathetic.

It's lovely.

It reminds me of all my old lost loves.

Yeah. Cece.

Or my ex.

She was a pill, but when she used to go to second base on me, she was like Joe Morgan.

What's whomp?

Are you talking about getting b*at up?

Yes.

I got this calendar bod, but it doesn't hold up in battle.

Look, it's 2016.

She's not looking for a strong husband.

That... no, tha-that's not what I was gonna...

That's not where I was going with this.

I'm getting married, Nick.

How am I going to defend Cece?

She deserves the best husband in the world, and what if I don't have what it takes?

Of course you have what it takes to be a modern husband.

Do you have what it takes to be a husband of the old world?

God, no.

They would use you as a pelt.

Today, you fought, kinda.

You're gonna make a great husband to Cece.

How do you know?

Because I know.

Because why?

Because.

Look what happened here today. Because why?

Beca... ever since I've known you, you've been there.

Okay, you're always there.

Even when I don't want you there, you're there.

That's what a husband does.

You fight for me. That's what a husband does.

You care about what I eat.

That's what a husband does.

You've cooked for me, even when I don't ask.

That's what a husband does.

When I pass out, you comb my hair so there's no knots in it.

That's what a husband does.

So, guess what.

You're gonna be a great husband to Cece because you're a great husband to me.

So that's how I know.

You're, you're like my husband.

You're like my wife, but...

Yeah, so that's how I know.

Thanks for saying that, man.

Yeah, man.

[gagging, coughing]

I need this to be done, okay?

Well, you can't take it back. I heard you say it, Nick.

We're pouring out one for our lost loves.

Good-bye, unrequited love for Aly.

May I now heal and, and move forward.

I'm proud of you, man.

And as a gift, I'm gonna give you your own property back.

You don't have to do that. I mean, it's not...

I don't really need it, but...

Whoa.

Aly is single.

Aly is single!

Nice! Oh, great.

Hey. Hey.

Okay, so are you gonna tell her how you feel?

I don't know. I don't know, uh, I don't know, I mean, what if she doesn't like me back?

What if I'm not good enough for her?

What if I can't bear her sons?

You have to try. Look, I didn't think I was good enough for Cece.

You aren't.

Winston, I don't know how this is going to work out, but you need to know that you're good enough.

You got a heart of gold.

You got a smile that... [groaning]

He's been having some really nice moments today and then kind of freaking out.

You son of a bitch!

So, what, you guys think I should tell her how I feel?

Yes. You absolutely should.

Let's go now.

What about your bachelor party?

Who could want anything more from a bachelor party than their best friend telling him that they love him.

No. For real? You said that?

I didn't tell him that I love him. Let's be clear about that.

I missed that?

You know what?

I'm gonna tell Cece how I feel about her.

I'm gonna get her back.

You do that, bud... wait, wait.

Both: What?

You guys go on ahead without me.

I'm gonna hang back here for another round with my desert queen.

Besides, there's nothing for me in the city.

Wait a second. Don't you have two kids?

Thank you.

Well, I'm on my way to meet Aly and her boyfriend for brunch.

Yeah, that was sarcasm.

And this is shark-casm: I just hate eating people.

Dear Lord, do you mean to tell me that you're going to brunch with the woman that you love and her boyfriend?

That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

No, it's not that bad. I mean, I'm in a prank marriage, anyway.

He was wearing this.

He was wearing a frickin' football helmet.

Ah, damn.

What happened next was primal.

Man versus woman.

The ancient battle of the flesh.

Calm down. It's probably just happening because you're getting more serious with Sam.

Yes.

And Sam is finally, just a little bit, sort of, starting to trust me.

And he wants me to meet his parents.

You can't meet a man's parents if your ex is making love to you in your head.

I need my mind Nick-free by tonight.

On this bed is everything Nick gave me while we were together.

I'm going to get rid of it to clear my subconscious.

All right.

Good-bye, sex helmet.

Good-bye, uh, lacquered bagel with my name on it.

Good-bye, world's tiniest hedgehog.

That was a gift?

Good-bye almost done Rubik's Cube.

Literally, it was one turn from the end and he would not finish it.

That makes sense with Nick.

People try to pretend like the brain is so complicated, but I feel better already.

Well, the two most important men in my life are finally meeting.

And for some reason this other guy's here.

Yo.

Hey, brunch is on me today, guys, okay?

So, feel free to add blue cheese to anything.

I'm an agent for animal actors.

He's doing pretty good.

He recently signed the crow from Game of Thrones.

Darnell. You know his name.

Darnell. That's right.

I didn't realize an animal agent was a real job.

Let me put it to you this way, so the next Avatar movie takes place on a cat planet, and, uh, I was the first one they called.

Shut up.

I know.

I knew you were gonna like that.

A cat planet?

I know. He swore me to secrecy.

I was gonna tell you.

My good... you know, I always thought Furguson should be in the movies.

Would you interested in, uh, I don't know, taking a meeting with him?

He's got no representation, so he's...

Let me guess. Wait. He has an adorable yawn?

Yeah.

Of course he does.

He's a cat.

But can he show up every day to work?

I run a business. Pass.

Yeah, never mind. Dumb idea.

Tripp, you have got to sit down with Furguson.

He's literally one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever laid eyes on.

Really? I thought you hated him.

I thought you hated cats in general, actually.

I love Furguson, are you kidding me? It's Furguson.

He's got that, uh... he's got the little, uh, his, uh...

You know, his front?

Does he have a headshot?

No, but W-Winston, actually does have a lot of 8x10 photos of the cat's face.

All right, fine. Bring him by my office.

Can't miss it. It's the tallest building in Beverly Hills.

Hey, hey, hey. Where'd you get that?

I got this from the shoulder-less Dutch boy you live with.

Jess?

Possibly.

That's mine. Why are they throwing away my stuff?

They're throwing away me. Give it back.

All right, but my babies come with it.

I don't want your rock babies.

Well, I'll just keep 'em.

Okay.

[rock clattering]

Sorry, Leviticus.

He's tough.

Why is everyone throwing away my stuff?

First of all, that is not your helmet.

You gave that to me.

And second of all, I need a clean house.

I need a clean room. A clean mind.

Yeah, dirty room, dirty dreams.

No dirty dreams. No one had dirty dreams.

What are you talking about? No dirty dreams.

So there has been dirty dreams?

No.

What'd you have a dream about?

It's interesting, Jessica. What was it about?

There was no dream, dude.

Well, which one of you is gonna cr*ck and tell me what the dream was about? Jess?

Or Cece?

You looked at the helmet.

Cece!

I did not. I did not.

You had a sex dream about a Bear's helmet?

Who was wearing it? Ditka?

Vic Fangio? John Fox?

Our GM, Ryan Pace?

He's cute, but come on.

She doesn't know any of those people, Nick.

Cece!

So...

She doesn't know those people.

So it was somebody you know.

There wasn't... No. Absolutely not. No.

Oh, my God.

You had a sex dream about me.

No.

It was... no... there was no...

Well, well, well, well, well.

I don't have time for this.

What will it take for you to just forget about this and get rid of the helmet?

Oh, just every single detail about the dream.

Damn.

Now, and this one is a biggie, was I 100% percent human?

What?

Obviously.

Okay, I'm just trying to figure out the reality of the dream.

Well, we were having sex, so in that sense, it was not reality-based at all, because that's never gonna happen again.

Oh!

You sound like the beginning of a Salt-N-Pepa song, and I just wish we could just, like, act like adults.

Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely.

Were you just recreating our best encounter?

Was it Glove City again?

Our best was not Glove City.

Oh, it wasn't?

It was for you, but not for me.

So what was our best, in your opinion?

Ooh, you just walked right into that one.

Okay, it wasn't something that actually happened.

It was historical.

Oh, historical, so was there a dragon?

No, it was historical.

You think dragons are real?

I think there's a lot of debate about it.

And there's a lot of blogs about it.

And I know that as a fact, 'cause I've written one.

Do you think dinosaurs are dragons?

There's debate about dragons, Jess, and we're not doing this right now.

Wow, this office is nice.

M... look, this is so nice of you, man.

We're gonna break it.

But what about your dad?

Look, it sucks to admit, but Sam's a really good guy with above average handsomeness.

And he's above six feet tall, which I know means a lot to you.

And he makes you happy, and so...

I think it's time for me to stop coming in between you guys.

Let's do this. Let's have a little bit of fun, huh?

[clattering]

I will be going on the count of three.

One, zero, two, three, four...

What are you doing?

You never go on three.

You want to catch the patient off guard.

It's less scary that way.

Everybody knows it. It's just a doctor trick.

Nick. So this time I am going on three.

One, two, three, four...

Do it!

[Nick and Jess yelling]

So this is the famous Patches.

No. I am...

Winston L'andre Bishop and this is: the king of cats.

Lover of mats.

No friend of rats.

The kitty from Angel City, Furguson Michael Jordan...

Bishop.

[laughs]

[meows]

[laughing]

He just, poof...

I'm gonna try to settle him down. and disappeared.

[laughter continues]

♪ What would you do if your son was at home ♪
♪ Crying all alone ♪
♪ On the bedroom floor ♪

Oh, my God, he's singing to the cat.

Come on.

He's singing to the cat.

Let's get out of here.

It's okay. We're here. We're here.

Okay, Patches is here.

I was four steps away from freedom [sighs] and I fell.

Oh, they were on me, and they traversed me.

It was like I was their city and they were all rushing to work.

May I just please take a moment with Patches?

She needs a, a moment to center herself.

She almost OD'd on catnip.

Forget about Patches.

You should represent more cats like Furguson.

What?

What? You were laughing at him.

He's an original.

Makes Patches look like a Culkin brother.

What?!

[laughing]

It's hard to celebrate this moment with so much cat hair in my mouth.

You did it, buddy.

Really? Really? Now you're gloating?

Huh? Winston?

Ah.

Do you have to be such a dick?

I mean, you're already so intimidating.

Do you have to go out of your way to actually get at me?

Intimidating?

Aly talks about you all the time, obviously.

You're a cop. You're a hero.

Last weekend, I went to a turtle's birthday party.

This is oddly emotional.

You're intimidated by me?

Yes.

It's funny how life works, man. It's ironic.

This is amazing.

You know what, Tripp?

You don't have to worry about Furguson competing with Patches.

Yeah.

I'm taking him out of the game.

I don't like this life for him.

Oh, yeah!

You blew it, son.

Oh, God, am I unhappy.

I'm casting cats.

[Patches meows]

Hi. So sorry I'm late.

It's a long story. [laughs nervously]

I'm really glad you made it.

Me, too.

Uh, Dad, Dad, this is Jess.

Hi.

So nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Oh. Huh. A little piece of helmet.

[laughs]

♪ ♪

What did you think of Tripp?

I know he's a little intense.

Well, look, I mean, if he makes you happy, then, uh... and I like him, so...

Thanks.

You know, for a guy who eats his raisins hot, your opinion means a lot to me.

Thank you.

What's up with Schmidt?

[hissing, huffs]

Oh, he's haunted.

Hey.

Hey.

Did you have a dream last night?

Yeah, just the usual.

You know, the one where I'm in a muffin test kitchen and Hillary Clinton tells me my muffins suck.

So that's the regular one.

Got you a present.

Can I open it right now?

Yes.

Oh.

I thought you could hang it on the wall here.

I love that.

It's like your dad's looking over the bar.

Aw, thank you, Jess.

It's really nice.

All right.

Now to be fair, I've had some sex dreams about you, too.

First, there was the one where I was a spider and instead of legs it was penises.

No, I'm out.

It was eight penises...

Yeah, I know.

Oh.

You were there, too.

I'm out.

Was I there?

And I'm out.

Oh, that would've been so cool.





How do you spell "boudoir"?

I'm so far off, I'm not getting the auto-correct.

So which girl are you texting now, the coffin-maker?

Oh, you're thinking about Jamie.

Nah, nah. She kinda disappeared into her busy season, so this is Rhonda.

Oh, is this the girl with the yogurt mouth?

That's Simi Valley Sue.

Rhonda is Willem Dafoe's assistant.

No, she's n... Rhonda's the army reservist.

Boy, you are on such a tear with the ladies, Winston.

(whistles) Your boy cleanin' up.

Not thinking about Aly.

And Rhonda, you know, she's cool, man.

I'm having the most fun with her.

She really keeps me on my toes.

And y'all know Winston love being on his toes.

Definitely, definitely.

You know, actually, she's poppin' by later.

You guys will get to meet her before the wedding.

Before the... she's coming to our wedding?

Yes. Winston, you're gonna bring this flavor of the month to our wedding?

Well, I was...

She's gonna be in wedding photos?

Are you kidding me?

Oh, gather round, grandchildren.

Look at Uncle Winston, and this woman who is not Willem Dafoe's assistant.

Well, I am excited to meet her.

Can you tell us some basics?

Her-her last name, her rank...

Yeah, I don't know any of that stuff.

I've only been on two dates with her, so...

Two dates, how do we even know that she's fighting for our army?

Hey! Are we looking at the owner of a new used car?

No. (scoffs) I wish.

Billy from Car County started playing misogynist bingo with me as soon as I walked in the door.

He called me "dollface."

Started pointing out all the room in the trunk for my shopping bags.

Then, he explained four-wheel drive to me.

I don't need four-wheel drive explained.

It's very well named.

Like World Series of Poker champion, Chris Moneymaker.

Continue, though.

Okay, you know how you get back at this guy?

Huh. You do the entire thing online.

You set up an e-mail address, but under a dude's name.

Yes. I love it.

Help! Help!

There's some lunatic after me! (yelling)

Oh, my God!

Call 911!

Call 911!

Please, somebody help me.

(everyone yelling at once)

Winston! Winston, go...!

Jess: Oh, my God! Stay there! Wait!

Don't pull it out.

(laughing)

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

(both laughing)

You just got Rhonda'd.

(laughing)

Rhonda'd!

(Rhonda and Winston laughing)

What's your last name?

I'm almost done with my "Jeff Day" e-mail to the dealer.

I've constructed a very rich back story for him.

Listen to this, listen to this.

Okay.

He wrote this while on break from his job, which is hanging telephone line.

He should have a desk job by now, but the ground has always been trouble for him.

Yeah, the poles are safer.

And sometimes, at dusk, he can see his buddies from Desert Storm dancing in the static.

That's beautiful.

Yeah, it's okay.

So you need a dude pass before you send it off, right?

No, I don't need a dude pass.

No, no. Listen to this.

My wife is on my nuts.

I need two grand off the MSRP.

Go, Clips.

Go, Clips! Good, yeah.

Hey, Nick, if anyone's gonna give Jess a dude pass, it's gonna be me.

A dude pass.

Not a pretty-boy pass.

Not a "I make my money from my mind" pass.

Not a "I look like the cute benchwarmer on an NBA team, "but I'm not good enough to play."

Are you done?

After I take my dude pass, why don't you take a short guy pass?

Why don't you take a snake voice pass?

Is it frustrating for you when you go to concerts and you can't see the stage 'cause you're so short?

It can be.

It can be!

I know we're in an awkward situation.

I used to date Nick, now I'm dating Sam, again.

I thought we were over all this.

And now every time I turn around, you guys are in some kind of turf w*r.

Are we in a turf w*r? I didn't even notice, you punk.

This can't go on forever.

Let's just get our emotions out there.

Let's just express ourselves...

I'm good. I don't...

I got nothing.

Yeah, I mean, everything's fine.

You feel good?

Yeah, I feel great.

You feel good, I feel good.

Yeah, I got nothing to talk about, yeah.

We're good, man.

I don't feel nothin' towards you man.

You can spit on the bottom of my shoe, dude.

(Winston laughing)

Let's...

Schmidt: This is what you want for our nuptials?

Shenanigans?

This is our wedding, Cece, not "Ernest Goes to Our Wedding."

Can't we just revoke Winston's plus one?

Okay, look, I'm sure there's more to Rhonda than just pranks, all right?

We owe it to Winston to get to know her.

Well, let's start at the beginning.

Tell us about your childhood. Where'd you grow up?

Well, I grew up in Baltimore.

Oh.

I don't like to talk about it around new people, but we were homeless.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

I had no idea.

It was tough.

We didn't have money for food, clothes, toys.

My brother and I adopted a rat.

I remember, we called the rat Singular Wireless.

He was sweet.

Until he ate my brother's pinkie toe clean off.

(quietly): What?

He bit it like a baby carrot.

Just (snapping).

It woke me up.

That snap, that snap.

In the end, we laughed about it, 'cause what else can you do?

Just Singular being Singular.

Gosh darn it.

(sighing)

He ran away after a while... my brother, not the rat... he didn't get far, obviously, not with nine toes.

Listen, it wasn't a great childhood, and I know that I come on strong, but I guess, if I can scare people with my pranks, then I know I'm not the only one who's scared.

What a cruel, terrible world we live in.

I had no idea.

I'm so, so, so, sorry.

(both guffawing)

You're stupid, Schmidt.

And you're-you're stupid, too, Cece, Stupid.

Okay, wait, so the en... the en... the entire story is a lie?

Rhon. Da'd.

Pow-pow.

Need a little more of this.

Anybody else want some, uh, wine?

Oh, no, thanks.

I salted it.

(Rhonda guffaws)

You salted the wine? How is that even a prank?

You just told her that you salted it before she took a sip.

Unless of course that the prank is that there's no salt in it.

(spits)

(guffawing)

Yes, there's salt.

There's most definitely salt in that.

(laughing)

This is delightful.

Mr. Day, I, too, love Sons of Anarchy.

You drive a pretty hard bargain.

I agree to your terms!

You just have to sign the papers in person.

I'm at the dealership for another hour.

Ah, I did not think this through.

(sighing, groaning)

Nick... I have h*t a snag in my car buying.

I'm not surprised you came to me.

I heard you and, uh, Dr. Trap-Jaw last night, and he climaxes like a woman.

That was me.

Then you sound like a woman when you climax.

I am a woman.

What's your point?

We're still on your point.

I'm waiting for you to wrap it up.

My point is... your car deal went south, and so you need Nick Miller to twist some nips for you, yeah?

Nope. The nips have already been twisted.

All I need right now is someone to pretend to be Jeff Day.

And I would ask Sam, but he's in a procedure all day.

He's de-webbing some kid's toes.

It sounds whimsical, but it's actually very serious.

Why would you go to him?

He cannot close this deal for you, Jess.

The deal has already been closed.

Right now, I just need, literally, any man.

(chuckling)

If I could wish a mannequin to life, I would.

(both laughing)

Oh, Jessica.

You understand that fate fused that kid's toes together.

And Dr. Sam is the man for that job, but I'm the man for this job.

So if you excuse me, let me get my Julius Pepperwood disguise.

Wait, no, no, no. You don't understand.

I just need you to pretend to be Jeff Day.

Well, I need some sort of disguise.

Absolutely not.

What about a mustache?

That's a disguise.

Not if I grow one.

We're in the car in ten minutes.

You gonna grow a mustache in ten minutes?

No man could do that.

Scientifically impossible.

Hey, I guess science always wins, right?

See ya in the car.

Jess: All right, now remember, Jeff Day is a lovable schnook, who makes sausage in his spare time.

You work for the phone company, so you call the phones "units."

All right, what's my back story?

Units, that's good. Uh, you're my wife.

You spend all day making sausages, and clucking with the other hens on the kitchen unit.

No, no. I'm a disgraced ice-skating sensation.

I got ex-communicated from the sport for protesting that nudie fabric.

And then I broke my butt.

Right, and which toe is webbed?

Ugh, Nick, that's real life.

Ugh. This is gonna be a disaster.

Abort, abort.

Dollface!

You're back!

Hi. I am, I am.

Um, I believe you've been e-mailing with my husband Jeff.

Jeff Day.

Lover of meats, enemy of nonsense.

Put her there. (laughs)

Nice mustache.

My guy.

All right.

Oh, excuse me for a minute.

I have to go feed the meter.

Uh, excu... before you go, can you please fill us in on all active pranks at this table?

I think you found them all, okay?

Relax.

Oh, wait! Winston...

I put a watch battery in your huevos rancheros.

(Rhonda laughs)

In the huevos?

No, you did not.

Winston, she's been sitting down this whole time.

Does she have someone working with her in the kitchen?

Can you explain to me how that's funny?

'Cause you could have cracked a molar or choked to death.

(laughing) It's hilarious.

'Cause what if I choke on the battery?

You know what I mean?

Or if the battery breaks open inside of me, you know? and causes all kinds of... no?

What-what? You guys don't like her?

Mm...

Uh...

And I mean, look, I get it.

She might not be the one, but come on, at least we're having fun, right?

We gave her a chance, okay, Winston?

But I am scared to touch my food, and I don't want to feel that way at our wedding.

Yes.

Winston, it brings me no joy to do this, whatsoever, but I'm revoking your plus one.

You gave me that plus one, which means I can bring anyone.

Plus one means plus anyone.

For the Schmidt-Parikh wedding, it's a plus the one.

You just had that one locked and loaded, didn't you?

Excuse me, sir? Here's your check.

Oh, my God!

That's my face. Why is that my face?

Ha-ha!

(laughing)

Winston: No, no, no, no.

Save it.

It's gonna be wasted on these two.

Let's get out of here.

How did she get a mask of my face?

Oh... (scoffs) did they just stick us with the bill?

N... no.

She left, like, $300.

Who does this prank?

Thanks for meeting with us.

I don't know... what made me think I could have possibly bought a car by myself.

You were right to get your hubby involved.

Now, Mr. Day, your mind seemed pretty made up over e-mail.

Look, Billy, I wish, uh, we could get twin hogs, but then the missus would stop giving me that sweet potato pie.

You know Jeff Day, I need my sweet potato pie every four hours.

Ain't that right, baby?

I married a hungry man.

Billy: If you're open to other options, we just got a consignment of vehicles that we are looking to move at rock bottom prices.

I had my heart set on that cute little car that you showed me in that e-mail you wrote.

(chuckles)

Had a really big makeup mirror, and I sure was excited about it.

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, buh-buh...

There's no harm in hearing what the catch of the day is, right?

No harm.

Exactly.


Billy, Jeff needs to take his omega-3 pill.

Could you grab us a glass of water?

Not a problem.

I got a bad ticker myself.

Not... uh... I had him right where I wanted him.

He's trying to bait and switch us, and you're gobbling it up like an old king with a turkey leg.

You're leaving money on the table.

I can smell it.

Watch. I'm gonna string him along, and then I'm going to get you a better deal.

He thinks he's fishing for me.

Nah, I'm fishing for him, but from the water.

You're in way over your head.

Right where a fish wants to be.

Here's your water, and... take as many mouse pads as you want.

Quit stalling me.

Smart.

Tell me about the secret stash, Billy.

These vehicles are a lot bigger than what you were e-mailing about.

Well, a car can never be too big, and a pot can never be too sweet.

(mouthing)

I hear ya, so I guess, don't waste your time with anything smaller than a two liter?

Two liter?

I want a car, not a Mountain Dew.

(all laughing)

You want to send this girl out on to the road with a little bulk, in case she gets h*t, or more likely, hits someone, am I right? (laughs)

While she's text messaging.

They can't stop.

They're beautiful, but... (boinging)

(laughing): I like you.

Honey, don't forget how much research you put in.

You don't want to throw that all away, like I did with my skating career.

Jeff, you clearly know your way around an engine.

What are we talkin', 5.0?

You want the bird to sing in my underpants, I'm gonna need double digits.

Oh, yeah, Jeff. baby!

Oh, yeah.

Yeah!

It's gonna sing.

Boom.

(cell phone chiming)

You get me.

(Billy and Nick laughing, making goofy noises)

Excuse me. I have to take this.

It's Oksana Baiul. Honey, get the car I want, or the only pie you'll be eating is out of the garbage.

(laughs)

Hey, I thought you were de-webbing.

Well, it took less time than I thought.

Yeah, he only wanted his big toe free, so he could wear flip-flops.

How's the new car?

Ugh!

Don't make a thing out of it, but I had to ask Nick to be Jeff Day.

You asked Nick for help, not me?

Well, you were in surgery, and he was the only person I could find, but he's screwing it up so much that I really wish I'd "Reverse-Tootsie'd."

Of course he's screwing up. He's a little human porkchop.

I'm on my way.

Wait, don't come. Don't come.

I could be Jeff Day.

I just need to find a fake mustache.

What is it with you guys and mustaches?

Look, I have the situation un-under control.

Cutting Winston's plus one creates a real ripple effect.

Jason gets bumped from 14.

Ruthie gets bumped from 6, landing Tyler right next to the bar, which feels like tempting fate.

Yeah, you know what? The more I think about it, we may have judged Rhonda a little too harshly.

Maybe you're right. You know what?

If Winston is happy, with Lady Kutcher, we should support him.

What's the worst that can happen?

Maybe she'll put some cellophane over the toilet bowls.

Hopefully, my Uncle Randy doesn't get (door opens, closes) fired up at the buffet.

Hey, guys.

We were just talking, and we're sorry about earlier.

Oh, listen, I've been thinking about what you said, and maybe you're right.

I want the woman that I bring to your wedding to be special.

Special like... my wife.

(laughing)

Both: We got married!

(laughing)

What?!

You got married!

Well, look, you guys said to be more serious, and nothing's more serious than holy matrimony.

I mean, this is what you guys wanted, right?

No! No! This is insane.

And we were totally out of bounds in the first place.

We never should have interfered in your love life.

No.

Got you again!

Boom!

That's what we needed to hear.

Huh? Wait. What?

What, so you... wait a minute.

You're not actually married?

(laughing)

Oh, thank... thank goodness.

It was... it was just a prank.

It was just a prank. Okay.

Just a prank.

How did you guys get such a realistic marriage certificate?

Does it look realistic?

Oh, that's good. They did a good job on it, 'cause it's a hundred percent real.

We got you.

We found a same-day chapel, and then we got married, as a prank.

Wha-uh...?

So-so you really did get married?

Y'all can't keep up.

How is really getting married, Winston, a prank?

The authenticity of the marriage is what makes it a great prank.

Come on, guys.

Yeah.

Says who?

Hold on. wh... no, please.

Let them explain. Please explain.

We've already explained it.

A simple prank is a strong prank.

Uh-huh.

Okay.

Let's just say... I don't know, I told you that I cut my pinkie finger off, and then I actually cut my pinkie finger off.

Rhonda: Mm.

Is that a prank?

Is that a prank?

Well, I would not see that coming.

Okay.

Different direction.

Let-let's say that I-I told you that I invested all of my money into boogie boards.

That's just a lie.

And then I took you to my accountant's office, and sitting behind the desk was just a little crab in sunglasses.

Hmm, still sounds like a lie.

And then my real accountant came out and showed you the books and, in fact, I had invested all of money in boogie boards.

That's definitely a prank.

Yeah, that would get me.

That's-that's a good one.

That's crazy, yeah.

That's a good one.

Rhonda: That's a good one.

I don't understand this.

Okay, so this is like a lifelong prank?

Oh, no, no, we're getting it annulled tomorrow.

Oh, right.

Rhonda: Tonight's the honeymoon.

Listen, a little marriage advice...

I would know because I'm married... a happy wife, uh, a happy life.

Have you heard the saying before?

Mm.

I'm questioning everything right now.

I swear, I swear... I swear...

He's about 5'10".

Maybe a mustache.

Sometimes he just sits in the bathroom buying music.

Do you think you could check in there?

Is that him in the RV?

Oh, no.

He wouldn't be in an RV.

He is, he is. That's him in the RV.

You look natural behind the wheel of that baby.

I felt like myself for the first time in my life.

Jess: Hey, Jeff.

Where were you, and why weren't you answering your unit?

Excuse me.

Excu... yeah.

Good stuff, Billy. Thank you.

Ow.

Is this you doing your plan?

I don't know.

He keeps changing things up.

He's very good at his job.

Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Jeff Day.

My brother.

Geoff with a "G."

Yeah, I came as soon as I could.

Jess: I don't know why.

I explicitly told you not to.

Nick: Yeah, why don't you take a hike? No one needs you here.

The reason she came to me first.

Sorry, Billy.

There's a little bit of bad blood between my brother and my husband.

She may have come to you for help, but you're clearly not getting the job done, which is why she'll always come back for my help.

As soon as you get a helping of my help, you're never the same.

No one helps me better than I help myself.

I told you if you'd just guide me.

Let's not get into that now.

I don't really know what you guys are talking about, but are you still buying the RV?

No! I'm not buying an RV.

Honey, he's giving us a great price.

Why don't you get those numbers?

Don't get those numbers.

Why don't you go get them?

Stay right there.

Why do women always bring your drama in here?

Oh, you're blaming me?

Hah! All right.

I'd like to test-drive my car right now.

I showed you where all the mirrors are, right?

(engine revs)

(Sam and Nick screaming)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

(all yelling at once)

Now you guys are listening to me!

Get ready for the scariest test-drive of your lives.

♪ Simply the best... ♪

I don't care if you're hot.

I'm always cold!

Nick: Slow down!

Sam: Oh, man, this speed...

Nick: God!

Billy: Oh, God!

You're gonna give me what I want.

I can't give you a thing until I talk to my manager.

You're talking to me. I know you need to get rid of this 2017.

It's the end of the month.

I know you haven't made your nut.

Okay, I'll give you the original deal.

The one from the e-mail.

You'll do better.

I want Bluetooth.

(men screaming)

I want voice activation.

Billy: Oh, God! No, no!

Sam: No, no, no, no, no! No!

Whoa! Okay, okay... Okay-kay-kay...

I want to feel like I'm driving a spaceship.

Anything you want.

Nick: That's impressive.

Oh, that was impressive.

You're really good at this, Jess.

Really good.

Now for you two, jokers.

I'm sorry I went rogue, Jess.

I'm sorry, too.

You told me not to come, but I did.

Don't apologize to me.

Talk to each other.

Figure out a way to both be in my life.

Otherwise, I'm gonna turn the heat up to 90.

I'm gonna turn the radio to Pink.

And I am going to find a cobblestone street.

Oh, no, please don't. I gotta go to the bathroom.

Shut up, Billy!

You have a little boy's name.

You are so mean!

Now solve it.

Deal with your emotions.

Jess, you don't get it.

The stuff between Sam and I is deep guy stuff.

It's untalkable.

That's right. I punched him twice.

And I stole his girlfriend.

We're talking about adultery and v*olence.

That part of the male brain has not been civilized.

So you're just gonna feud forever?

I'll teach my sons to hate his sons and I expect the same from him.

You got it.

Thank you.

If you insist on hating each other, do it while I'm not around.

The moment I walk in the room, I want some convincing dude on dude friendship stuff.

I want high-fives.

I want golf tips.

When a hot waitress walks by, I want to see a real nudge-nudge.

Hubba, hubba.

Billy: Keep your hands on the wheel!

Nick: Easy! Jess!

(men clamoring)

I can do it if he can.

I can do it even if he can't do it.

(laughs)

Are you wearing a fake mustache?

Yeah.

Thanks for coming to my annulment, guys.

Yeah, well, we should get to know your ex-wife.

Yeah, like, did she make that mask of my face, or does she have a mask guy?

Rhonda's in here.

Is it weird that I'm a little nervous?

Yes.

Yeah.

Rhonda.

Will you make me the most hilarious man in the world by being my ex...

(all screaming)

Come on!

Rhonda's a boy! Rhonda's a boy!

You ain't Rhonda.

Winston Bishop?

Y-y-yes.

I'm supposed to play you this.

Oh, here we go.

Winston, I think we should postpone our annulment.

Until you put the pieces of your mind back together.

(laughing, imitates sh**ting g*n)

I wish I could see your face right now.

But I can't, because I got called up for duty.

Bye-bye, hubby.

(nervous laugh) That's...

Wait, so we're still married.

Yeah.

But then how... but then how you gon... we were... we were co-pranksters.

How you gonna prank your co-prankster?

Hmm... I get it.

I finally get the prank now, man.

You got Rhonda'd.

I made Billy my baby.

I made that little bitch a bottle, right guys?

You did a great job, honey.

You did awesome.

What a terrific hybrid vehicle.

I'm glad that the previous owner scraped off all the "Co-exist" bumper stickers.

So I have no options.

I have no options. Okay, well...

Sleep with both eyes open, you idiot.

It's one eye, you idiot.

Cut your chance in half, you idiot.

Idiot.

Hey, don't bill me for this.

Sorry, that was my divorce lawyer.

What?!

Yeah, it's been a day. So I got married.

Then my wife was shipped overseas.

And I remain married.

What? Who? When? How? What?

Yeah, he married Rhonda. As a prank.

Wait, you're really married, Winston?

I-I'm not sure I understand the prank.

The prank is, is that Winston's on the hook to send care packages to Germany for the next six months.

Rhonda'd.

Guys, let's just celebrate how hilarious my situation is, and in a very real way, don't tell my mama.

♪ You're simply the best! ♪





Ugh! Son of a bitch. Nothing.

I'm trying to get in touch with Sam... you know, to clear the air...

Get out of my life.

Why isn't he responding?

I'm just gonna go out on a crazy limb here... maybe it's because you got his girlfriend to dump him?

I'm not being weird about it.

I just texted him three times.

(sighs, groans)

And I called him.

He wasn't there.

I left him a sensible voice mail.

To lighten the mood, I told a little story about how the first-graders' pet rabbit got stuck in the lawn mower and I had to...

I had to collect it.

That's a terrible story.

Colonel FlapEars?

Wow.

Unbelievable.

I had to park two blocks away, like an animal.

The new bar, Presh, is doing valet and they took all of our spots.

I've been saying for months that we need valet.

Is there anything sexier than tossing your keys in the general direction of someone you care nothing about?

"Keep it running."

Hi. I'm looking for Jessica Day.

Oh, right here. You've just been served.

What?!

What?

(gasps) A restraining order?!

From Sam.

Oof...

I'm not a restraining order person.

A restraining order. That's worse than herpes.

When I find Sam... (laughs)

I'm gonna k*ll him.

You can't find Sam.

'Cause you have a restraining order.

Winston. You have to help me with this.

Sam is the only one who can drop this charge.

But the magic of a restraining order is that you can't talk to him.

And that... that is human drama.

(indistinct chatter)

Schmidt: Wow.

Tasteful, hip...

I mean, nothing matches, yet nothing is random.

That's just a framed toupee on the wall and it friggin' works.

Cece: What are these bartenders wearing?

They look like Civil w*r surgeons.

This is a very professional establishment.

Let me do the talking.

You don't think I talk professional good?

You don't think I professional talk good?

What am I saying weird there?

You speak poorly, professionally.

Okay.

Hey, hey. I'm Connie, the owner.

You're the nutmeg wholesaler?

Me? No, I'm not the nutmeg wholesaler.

You have a nutmeg wholesaler vibe.

That's what it is.

I've been trying to figure it out for years.

You totally look like a nutmeg wholesaler.

Me no nutmeg...

Connie: How can I help you?

Connie, hello.

Very nice to meet you.

We are both local entrepreneurs, as you are.

Uh, we co-own the bar up the street, and there is a business situation that we would like to bring to your attention...

Yeah, your stupid valet is taking all the spots in front of our bar, and it's time for it to come to an end.

It's not sittin' well with us folks over at the Griffin.

What's a griffin?

What is... wait, what is the Griffin?

The Griffin is the name of the bar that we own together, you buffoon.

You don't know the name of our bar?

Why don't we...

We don't have a sign. We should have a sign.

Is this the time for this?

I feel like this is a conversation I don't need to be a part of.

My valet is totally legal.

But thanks for stopping by.

Maybe, you know, maybe I'll stop by your bar.

I'll just, like, knock on doors until... until I find you.

Uh, please don't leave. Pl...

Okay, leave. We'll d-discuss this...

I don't like this woman.

Hey, uh, where should I put this, uh, nutmeg?

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

The lady's name is Connie.

She's o-over that way.

I'm here to overturn a restraining order.

I brought lots of excellent character references.

In the words of Ms. Cheryl Riggins of Portland, Oregon: "When the school sewage line broke, Jessica was the only student who rolled up her sleeves, grabbed a pail and went to work. She should be tested for hepatitis immediately. Immediately."

That's not the one...

Uh, sorry about that, Riggs.

Uh, Jessica, you better be here because you wrote a song you wanted me to listen to.

I just don't get why Sam would do this.

I'm not dangerous.

Hey.

Friend face. That was cute.

Cop face. Girl, sit yo' ass down.

And use the word "allegedly" when discussing Sam.

I do not need Internal Affairs crawling all up in my holes.

What if I typed up a note and left it on his car?

Oh, you stop it, Jess.

Yeah, but I...

Let it lie.

Okay.

No letters.

Jess: This would've been a better plan if I knew what he drives.

(sighs) A lot of black cars.

Cars should have people's names on them.

Ugh, it's so stupid.

(Sam speaking indistinctly)

(car alarm beeping)

(grunts)

Sam: Well, have a good one.

See you later.

See you tomorrow.

No. No.

Sam drives a truck?

(engine starts)

Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez.

Well, this is not my fault.

Hey, Jess, I'm at work.

Is this a cop situation or a friend situation?

Both. What would you say if I told you I was in the bed of Sam's pickup?

Allegedly.

I said "allegedly."

Okay, good. So you're not in the back of a truck.

No, I am.

I'm-I'm, I am "allegedly" in-in Sam's truck.

Jess, you seem to be confused. Here's how it works.

Um, allegedly, Ferguson and I are eating pasta in a hot air balloon. Realistically...

Winston, I'm in the back of Sam's truck right now.

I wanted Sam to know that I'm not crazy.

Wait, shh, he's changing his music.

♪ Can't keep my hands to myself... ♪

Selena Gomez, interesting.

Ugh. (grunting)

Jess, what is happening right now?

(voice vibrating)

Cece: Connie, with her fancy cocktails.

I can make a fancy cocktail.

Sure you can.

Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?

What the hell is all this stuff?

We need to make some... some real improvements around here, if we're gonna compete with Presh.

Improvements?!

Just minor tweaks, okay?

Like a jukebox that doesn't catch f*re sometimes.

Separate olive and cherry trays.

A toilet that flushes down and not up.

Okay, that's an attraction and a lot of our customers actually like that.

Why are you so eager to change our bar?

We should be ruining their bar.

We should cut their power.

We should paint a door where there isn't a door.

We're not talented enough to paint a realistic door, Nick.

All right, okay. Try this.

I call it "Whiskey Business," but surprise!

There's vodka in that.

Boom.

Thank you, honey.

(gagging)

Come on.

(clears throat)

It's a little chunky.

(clears throat)

Tastes like loose chili, a little bit.

(sighs) Yeah, I'm gonna go get some fresher ingredients.

Okay, you do that, hon. (retching)

Can we please stop competing with these fad bars?

I hate fads, man.

Nick, just a small little piece of important, friendly advice: you need to give your Ds more emphasis.

Fads.

What I said.

You're gonna get yourself in trouble.

By hating fads?

That's... maybe just change it to "trendy" bars.

Or "hip" bars.

We need to stop competing with trendy, hip fad bars?

(sighs)

Okay.

All right. I need a drink.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

Somebody cut our soda.

Oh, my God, who would do such a thing?

It's Connie, Schmidt.

Well, how would she have gotten in here?

I mean, she couldn't...

She took our bubbles, Schmidt!

We have to retaliate.

What do we look like, Tonya Harding's henchmen?

Who am I, Jeff Gillooly?

Either you care enough about this bar to fight for it, or you don't.

Because I care enough. I'll fight.

Let's do this. What are we gonna do?

We're gonna h*t her where it hurts.

I'm in.

Not the vag*na.

We're gonna go after the bar.

Uh, yes, that's ri... N... There was not even a single part of me that thought you were talking about the vag*na.

The bar.

The b...

Yes, the...

All right, I'm gonna take over the plan.

Good. Yeah, good.

It was getting on top of me.

(whispering loudly): Winston, sorry.

Sorry, I h*t some potholes, and then we got on the freeway, and then some schoolkids started throwing pencils at me, (bell rings) then we passed a cop, and I had to pretend to be a mannequin.

What is that noise?

Hang on a second, Winston.

(gasps) Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

(bell rings)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Where are you? What is that...?

Aah!

(grunts)

Jess: Winston, can you hear me?

Jess, I can't hear you!

Winston?!

I can't... Are you okay?

What is happening right now?

Winston: Hello, Jess?

Just like I envisioned it.

Connie cut our soda line.

So we take a fish, and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar.

The whole place is gonna smell like a whale's ass.

Not just any fish either.

A branzino. You know...

Freaking branzino.

She thinks she's hip and classy.

Wait till she tangles with the most highly regarded table fish in all the world.

I was trying to cut a runaway olive, and I cut the soda line.

(scoffs)

Why? Why'd you...?

I-I didn't think you'd actually notice, to be honest with you.

What are we going to do now?

Deny, deny, deny.

There's no way she'll know it's us.

Oh, hey, guys. I just came by to return your fish.

I've never seen that fish before in my life.

Ooh, is that a branzino?

Whoever bought that fish has impeccable taste.

Nick: I mean, I guess they kind of look like...

Nah, that doesn't even... No, that's...

Really?

Yeah, good luck finding those guys.

Of course it's us, you idiot.

Why'd you admit it?!

Schmidt: We're right there!

We might as well be wearing name tags!

You're so stupid, man.

You're so stupid, moron.

You're a bad guy to partner up in this stuff.

Schmidt: Give us a chance to, first, apologize and, second, give you a little bit of context here.

You see, (chuckles) we thought that you att*cked our bar.

Why would I att*ck a bar that has no one in it?

And if I did want to att*ck you, I would just report you for one of your numerous health code violations.

Some improvements definitely need to be made.

We... we found a d*ad fox in the keg room the other week.

We're not sure it was a fox.

Uh, it was an animal that had d*ed in our keg room that was bigger than a cat but smaller than a big dog...

A word of advice: do not mess with me.

This past year has been the worst year of my life.

First, my cat d*ed.

Then my husband left me for our neighbor, and so I had to listen to them having sex through our bedroom wall every single night.

And then he left my neighbor for my mother, which is, like, a very long story that I don't really want to get into.

Then my other cat d*ed.

Then I ran over a dog while I was driving to the vet with our d*ad cat on my lap.

You guys messed with my business... now I'm gonna have to destroy you.

If I may... ask... how and when you're planning on destroying us.

Any information would be... would be greatly appreciated.

Yeah, 'cause then we could prepare for it a little bit.

It's gonna be soon.

And when you least expect it.

That's something.

Thank...


You followed me into a car wash!

That is so not...

Okay, I have a...

What I want to say to you...

I have a lot of things I want to say to you.

I have a restraining order against you.

I'm not dangerous, and you don't need to be afraid of me.

Clearly.

Okay, (sighs) well, I guess, um... nice seeing you.

I'm gonna get to my next engagement.

Where are we, by the way?

I'll just check my little... my little thing.

It's actually not functioning.

(groaning)

Old gal got a little bit wet.

Eh, feed it to the birds.

(laughs)

(clank)

Oh! Oh...

That got me.

Yeah, that got me.

(breathing deeply): Oh, I'm just gonna rest for a second.

Get in the car.

Damn it.

Yeah, I get it.

It's too sad to watch.

♪

Clear.

Schmidt: Clear.

There are no signs of foul play back here.

Also, I feel fantastic.

That's because you're very drunk, Cece.

You're supposed to be spitting them out.

How would she poison our booze anyway?

We've been here the entire time.

Who knows?

You saw how intense she was.

We're at a state of high alert.

And, frankly, I don't trust your coat.

It's too warm to wear a coat like that.

Unless you're hiding a fish. You hiding a fish?

All I got's a chicken.

Okay, don't trust you.

Out you go.

Thanks for coming in again, Eric.

(scoffs) This bar is outrageous.

I'm so sorry it's not like your favorite bar, Presh.

You know my favorite bar is Heshe's Tango in Phuket.

Their coconut mojitos literally gave me an orgasm.

I had to buy new pants.

(mimicking): "I love Presh.

Presh has napkins and... walnuts."

Is that meant to be me?

No, I'm doing a spot-on Winston.

Because I do not talk like that.

Do you even like the Griffin?

What is the Gri...?

Are you kidding me?

It's... uh, the Griffin's our bar.

I knew that.

He loves it!

What the hell are you talking about, you booze hound?

We lost her a long time ago.

Cece, honey, drink some water, okay?

Nope.

Hey, man, do you know how hard I have worked at this bar in the past year?

I've k*lled myself for this place.

A year ago, we were in a sinkhole.

We were in the red.

But now, because of me, because of my work, we're in the white.

What's "the white"?

The white. Breaking even.

Oh, we're breaking even?

Yes, that's what I'm saying.

How wonderful. And let's just stop there.

Where will we invest our extra zero percent?

I know, how about in the toilet?

The same toilet that flushes upwards.

Wait! What if this... this was Connie's plan the entire time?

Okay, she knew we would be so paranoid that we would drive all the customers out of the bar and start fighting with each other.

Connie emptied this entire bar without lifting a finger.

Nick, you may not like her, but you must admit she is brilliant.

I don't have to admit that.

But I will say you've made something crystal clear.

I'm alone.

I'm all alone.

Oh, here we go.

So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna handle this myself, all alone.

I'm gonna call a meeting of the families...

Oh, Lord.

...a sit-down with all the businesses on the block, and you are not invited.

Okay, fine.

Shh.

Just take the rejection.

Hi. Oh, you guys open?

Yeah, yeah, we are. What can I get you to drink?

Ah, no, nothing.

I'm just here to see the "up" toilet.

Yeah, you are.

Look, I just want you to know, when you drop me off, that's it... I'm... not bothering you ever again.

Good.

I just want to say one thing...

Please stop talking.

(horn blaring)

Oh! Geez!

(Jess screaming)

(both screaming)

Aah!

(breathing deeply)

Get out. I'm calling you a car... out!

Sam, you were right to take a restraining order against me because, ever since I saw you again, I can't stop thinking about you.

I'm still very mad at you.

I feel like I'm on Grey's Anatomy in these scrubs.

I don't know what that means.

Oh.

No! We figured it out.

Jessica Day, take your hands off of this man.

Dr. Sam (friend face): good to see you.

(Cop face): 300 feet away from her.

When did you become a cop, dude?

Oh, not too long ago.

Congrats.

Thank you. I appreciate that. It's nothing, you know.

I get to do a lot of cool stuff on the job.

I once slid across the hood of a car.

I scratched it all up.

I didn't have to pay for it, you know.

'Cause I'm a cop, so...

(Winston laughs)

300 feet away.

I've gathered the families here today, to end this terrible, terrible, unnecessary w*r.

So, thank you.

Connie and I have had our battles, but today we make our peace.

She's of the north.

She's the owner of Presh.

What is this?

I only came because you said you were suing me for what I did, which, by the way, was nothing.

I lied to ensure your presence.

Good Lord.

Over here, we have Peter Verrebian.

(muffled): Yes.

Nick: Enjoying the pasta.

He is also the owner of Produce-slash-

Cold Beer-slash-Ice.

Peter, I know that's what the sign above your market says.

Is that the name of your establishment?

Yes.

Very creative.

Oh, and AnaLysa from AnaLysa's Nails wanted to be here, but she couldn't find somebody to cover her register.

And if you've ever gone in that place, it's messy.

Like, it's not a great... establishment.

How did things get this far, everybody?

This is so weird.

Thank you for the spaghetti.

Wasn't that a nice thing to say?

I wish we were all so polite.

Schmidt: I'd like to say something.

I don't need you here, Schmidt.

Connie... you know, Presh may have booths made of reclaimed wood and carefully curated artisanal flatware... but this bar will have something that your fancy place will never have.

What's that?

Nick Miller.

Oh. Well.

No, we'll never have that.

Of course I'm proud that this bar breaks even, but I think that you can do better than that.

I didn't just invest in this bar, Nick.

I invested in you.

No, you didn't.

You don't have equity in me, and we're...

I get it.

Hey, Connie... yours isn't the only bar on the block that has valet, starting immediately.

(sniffling quietly)

We have valet, kiddo.

You got valet.

(voice breaking): You got valet.

This is beautiful.

The valet's yours. The valet's yours.

Um... are they in love?

Yes. Very much so.

Okay. Hey, guys, um... let's just call a truce and end this.

If nothing else, so I can stop dealing with you.

I'll drink to that.

You got it.

Connie (sighing deeply): Okay.

A toast?

To us. Salud!

Okay.

This is good. This is really good.

Uh, yeah. My buddy Andy makes it in his basement.

I'm not allowed to say anything else about it, though.

Wow, I'm not kidding.

I think this is the best whiskey that I've ever had.

You want to go out with me sometime?

What? No. No.

No, no, no. Never.

Never.

Nick: But the whole back and forth with, like, the fish and getting mad at each other...

Never. Never.

When you came back and threw the fish down...?

Nothing...?

Where did you get there, from "I like this whiskey" to...?

What the hell was that?

You know what? Let it go. Let it go.

This was, this is my mistake. It was a misread...

I would sooner make love to Peter and his mouthful of spaghetti.

(smacking): Pass.

Okay, Peter.

Cheers.

Winston: 298, 299...

Watch out for the lamp.

And that's 300, right there. Wait here.

I'm dropping the restraining order. This isn't necessary.

I'll determine what's necessary; I'm a cop.

Stop! There's no more restraining order.

And no more cop face.

Girl, this is my friend face.

Honestly, I can't tell the difference.

Well, there is no difference.

That's why I have to announce it.

And as your friend, Winston, I just want to make sure that you two have thought things through.

That you're not rushing into things, you know?

You don't hurt each other again.

I'm thinking, maybe, as your friend, maybe... you should be restraining yourselves.

Because of the restraining order?

Look, we've grown up a lot.

We've made mistakes and we've learned from them.

Jess, nobody takes out a restraining order unless they think that they're in danger.

Winston's right.

What?

You're dangerous.

I mean, you're dangerous to me.

You want to know why I got the restraining order?

(inhales deeply)

'Cause I couldn't stop thinking about you either.

I didn't trust myself not to call you and start this whole thing up again.

You know, you-you've changed, Jess, and that's great, I just... I haven't.

And I'm still mad at you and... that's gonna take some time.

I think the, uh, best, smartest thing for us to do is to just... (inhales) say good-bye.

(sighs heavily)

What does Selena Gomez always say?

"Take your things and go..."

The lyric is, "Take away your things and go."

"Take your things away and go... Take away your things and go..."

"Take away your things and go."

Yeah.

Yes.

Good-bye, Jess.

Good-bye, Sam.

That's enough.

Winston: Wow.

Powerful stuff. (wry chuckle)

But I think we both know that it was for the best.

Oh, that's awesome.

Well, not really "new."

So where is it?

It's the most progressive school in Los Angeles.

It's basically heaven if heaven were populated with kids that look like tiny members of Arcade f*re.

Don't get me sick.

Don't get me sick either, man.

I got a date coming up, and I might get to mouth-base.

I'm not gonna get sick.

No germ can live in a body that is 65% beer.

Nick, are you eating raisins from my purse?

I confiscated those from a kid.

That explains why they're so sticky.

(chuckles) Sticky Nicky eats anything and I don't get sick.

Wow.

Jess: Did the kids build the chicken coup?

Yep. Only hens, though, obviously.

Banyon Canyon has a strict "zero cocks" policy.

I like how it... it encourages the chickens to stay inside but doesn't force them.

In line with our philosophy.

Who are we to tell the children what to learn and when?

Their teachers?

Williamsburg ate my seaweed, Genevieve.

No, I didn't.

Guys, I'm on the mend.

Sorry, Nick.

(sneezes)

Winston here has got that hot coffee date tomorrow, so...

But, to be clear, the date's hot, not the coffee.

Uh, thinking about going iced.

Don't look at my hands.

Thanks for backing me up, boo.

Oh, you know how boo do.

You know who's my boo? I got a clue it's you.

Aw...

(sneezes)

So... this is the most time we've ever spent alone.

Pretty interesting observation on your part.

Yeah.

What are we... what are we watching?

We are having a...

I just started streaming it, and now it won't stop playing.

Boy, ham sandwiches.

(laughs)

What is it?

It's hard to say.

It's either a puppet show for kids, or it's North Korean propaganda.

(screaming)

Pretty weird.

(screaming)

(Nick snickers)

(both chuckle)

Genevieve: I feel like we have a real connection.

Me, too.

I know it's only the first day of your trial period, but my gut is telling me... you're a perfect fit.

I just... like, I'm so happy here, I could cry, but the gray water bucket's too far away, and I want to save my tears to water these plants.

That's considerate. Ooh!

My partner's here to pick me up.

I think you're gonna really like him.

Sam: Sorry I'm late.

The string came out of my prayer beads, and they just bounced all over the office.

Oh...

So frustrating.

Genevieve: Sam, I want you to meet Jess.

This is the candidate we were discussing in the shower.

Yeah.

Jess, this is Sam, my partner.

Hey, Jess.

You're a doctor for children.

Uh, it's, you know, mostly paperwork.

How do you always look so beautiful in the morning?

(grunts)

(Nick groans)

Oh, my God.

You could have k*lled him.

(strained): I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

Hi, Sam.

Hi.

Have you met before?

We... Yeah, we've met.

We did. Yes, that's right, we met, we met.

(laughing): How funny.

Um, a bunch of times.

A lot of times. Very many. A lot of times.

We met a lot... Yeah.

Sometimes in the day, sometimes... in the, uh, nighttime.

Oh.

It was, you know...

Yeah, we, I mean...

Yeah.

Oh.

Bye, Jess.

Nice to see you.

The fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.

Okay, let's make this quick.

I need to work on my presentation.

It's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled, "I Hope You're Sitting Down for This."

'Cause it's chairs.

Yeah.

At which point you would laugh if you weren't so preoccupied with your date.

Okay, Winston, what are you wearing?

Well, you know, I don't want to overthink it.

It's just coffee, so...

So you're going to just dress like you did today, which apparently happened during a solar eclipse in a land of no mirrors.

Good note. Strong note.

Winston, listen to me.

Yeah.

This is the first date since the... since the Aly heartbreak.

This date is going to define the next chapter of your dating story.

Wear these magnificent sunglasses.

Put 'em on.

Oh, man.

You look like Brad Pitt on a t*nk.

In that movie Furry.

Yeah.

You ever see Furry?

Furry? Nah.

It's a bunch of dudes on a t*nk. They're, uh... and they're outnumbered and they sh**t a bunch of people.

Are they dressed in...?

You should check it out. Just look it up, Furry.

(chuckles) Google "Furry," nice, yeah.

Hey, don't screw up this date, it's important.

♪

(imitates sneeze)

(sniffles)

(coughing)

How is Genevieve dating Sam?

Is Los Angeles that small?

You guys even listening to me?

Yeah, we're listening.

(gibbers)

What-what did Queen Ta Ta say?

Well, the ball's tonight, and Queen Ta Ta's got nothing to wear, so she's got to find a dress.

What the hell is this show?

Both: Poppycock Palace.

It's amazing.

Winston, when did you get sick?

You were fine this morning.

Oh, yeah, I'm super sick.

(imitates sneeze)

(sighs) Genevieve just said, "Oh."

Oh's, like, the worst.

What should I do?

Don't do anything.

Just do nothing.

Nick: You're just gonna make it worse.

Leave it alone, Jess.

Oh, I know.

I could go talk to Sam.

(nose bl*wing)

I could ask him to put in a good word for me.

How long does it take to get over a breakup?

Two years? Two years is enough, right?

I swear to God, just leave it alone.

Schmidt: Let it lie.

Do nothing, Jess.

Four votes for leaving it alone.

That's what I'll do.

(all shouting)

I'll just do nothing.

Hi.

(chuckles)

I couldn't do nothing.

(groans)

(coughing)

(coughs)

We must find this Tee-Tee Wah Wah...

(sniffs loudly)

Humina humina humina humina...

(Nick groans)

(clears throat, Cece coughs)

(sniffling)

All these puppets do is sing about how they're friends.

I'm starting to not believe them.

(fanfare plays)

Shh!

This is the best part.

The Tee-Tee Wah Wah was in...

(drumroll plays)

It's in the damn Pee-Paw Playhouse!

Shh.

Spoiler alert, man.

The Pee-Paw Playhouse!

(laughing)

Every time.

I've been saying that for the past hour 'cause I saw you put it in there!

You know what?

I can't. I can not.

I'm not sick.

I've been faking it.

There you go, Poppycock Palace.

You've outed me!

You're choosing to be in here?

Why?

'Cause I'm freaking out about the date. Okay?

Why don't you want to go on this date?

Because I'm not over Aly.

And I know I should be moving on and this girl is okay, but she's not Aly.

(congested): No one is Aly.

What'd she say?

Wait.

Just hold.

Oh, please don't blow your nose.

You do it so disgustingly.

(bl*wing loudly)

Not done.

I don't need to know that bad what you said.

(Cece bl*wing nose loudly)

(continues bl*wing)

I'm beggin' you to stop. Just stop.

(sniffs wetly)

(coughs)

(clearly): No one is Aly.

Okay? You have to give other people a chance.

You deserve to be happy, Winston.

Just go on the date.

Or I could f*re up another episode and we could see where they hide the Tee-Tee Wah Wah this time.

I wonder where it would be.

(breathing roughly)

No, I'm-I'm gonna go on the date.

Yeah, I think I'll do that.

You guys are right.

Could you tell your future husband to let me out of this room, please?

I love that man, but he is not letting anyone out of this room.

Just being in here makes you fully contaminated.

(puppets chattering happily)

Uh, hey, I was hoping you could put in a good word for me.

I know you're mad...

No, I'm not mad, Jess.

I'm just, you know, bummed that you're at my house.

Obviously, I know I messed up our relationship and you probably think I'm a bad person, but if you could...

Jess!

What are you doing here?

At my lover's house?

Oh!


Hi! Hi.

Um, were you...

Making love?

Just finished.

He defused me like a b*mb.

That sounds nice.

Um...

Did you bake...

Sam brownies?

No. Chocolate's way too sexual.

(laughs)

This is just good, old-fashioned Kansas cornbread.

Jess...

No. (chuckles)

...my gut is telling me this isn't going to work out.

Please give me a chance to make this right.

Five minutes.

Mmm...

(high-pitched): Mmm...

Okay, good morning.

Yes, help yourself to a bagel.

Hmm.

They're all the same, Jan.

No need to put your hands on every one of them.

Okay, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on the seventh day, God... he rested.

Yes, that's right.

God rested on the seventh day.

But the question remains: what did he rest on?

That's right.

He rested... on a chair.

(sneezes)

Oh...

Look underneath your butts.

You will find mankind's greatest invention.

(exhales)

Without chairs, do you know what we have?

Squat, both position and diddly kind.

Jess: Sam, you got rid of your sofa.

Boy, that thing really gave me a rash.

Five minutes, Jess.

Okay, look.

I know it's weird to hire your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, but I think it's another way in which we are linked.

You are the best candidate we've had in a long time.

Thank you.

As we all know, healing is talking.

Samuel, what do you think?

I would love to explore all of this with you, but I have a circumcision to perform.

Hopefully not your own.

Just kidding. I know you're circumcised.

Ha, ha. Yeah.

Well, not that I think about it, it just...

I mean, I'm definitely not picturing it right now.

I am picturing it.

Only 'cause we talked about it.

How long did you two share your journeys?

Couple months.

But at first it was just sex.

Mmm. Mmm.

Sam: I used sex as a wall around my heart.

Mmm.

Uh, Jess climbed that wall many, many times.

Mmm.

Uh, couldn't stop climbing it.

I think I was not the only climber to climb that wall.

Until we decided to become a one-wall, one-climber mountain.

And then you invited another climber to lick your toehold.

My roommate, Nick, kissed me.

I'm so sorry, Sam.

I exist only in the present.

All of that's behind me.

What... what about this Nick?

Is he sorry?

I think Nick's kind of still upset that Sam punched him in the throat.

What?

Sam... so tender and delicate...

You haven't met Nick.

He's just the most throat-punchable boy in all the world.

I don't care. I don't even...

Nick is a whatever, I don't even have to...

Sam, do you need this Nick to apologize for wounding you?

I do.

Jess: So, Nick...

I'm wondering if you could come in the other room with me and just, like, real quick, apologize to Sam for kissing me?

No.

Jess, I told you to leave it alone.

I didn't, though.

I made it worse.

Now the only way I'm gonna get that job is if Nick apologizes to Sam.

Jess, he h*t me. He's gonna h*t me again.

He's not gonna h*t you.

Please, it's my dream job.

(puppets chattering)

I'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.

I know it hurt a whole lot.

Not that much, but you did it, so...

Okay.

And I feel like you should apologize to me for kissing my girlfriend.

Yes, uh, right.

Cool.

(exhales) Well, that went so well.

I-I don't really feel like that was a genuine apology, and-and I'd really like one.

Yeah.

I mean... did you feel like it was genuine?

Actually, he didn't even apologize.

Cool beard, Sam.

What'd you just say about my beard, bro?

"Bro"?

Yeah, I just said "cool beard."

I think your beard looks really cool.

Talk about my beard one more time, bro.

Sam, "bro" is a beach term.

The beard is very fun.

Say "beard."

You want me to say the word that starts with a "B," ends with a "D"?

Yeah.

Say "beard" one more time, bro.

Say the word "beard," bro!

(quietly): Beard.

(grunts)

Oh! Oh!

Nick, are you dying?

'Cause it looks like you're dying!

Not dying.

Who are you?

I don't know what it is.

I just can't help it with this guy.

Why didn't you just h*t me in the nads like a normal person, Sam?

Well, I'm leaving.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't, don't go!

Nobody goes.

Jim Morrison.

That's who you look like.

We are solving this conflict in the mother-loving Feelings Farm.

Those sunglasses are amazing.

Well, they're made even more amazing by your reflection in them.

Wait, how are you seeing my reflection in them?

You got me. I'm not.

(both laugh)

I'm just running game.

Are you this smooth-talking in regular glasses?

No, I'm not that smooth-talking, no.

I'm not. I'm not gonna lie to you.

Jess: Honesty, I stole coffee from a bagel restaurant.

Um, I didn't know how the line worked.

Okay, now I've talked.

Uh, who wants to go next... Sam?

Sure, uh, Honesty, I honestly want Nick to apologize for kissing Jess.

I did apologize, Sam.

Real, real quick... you have to address Honesty directly.

You want me to talk to a chair?

(quietly): I don't want to.

Hey, you like soup?

Right? You like soup, right?

Of course I like soup.

All right, well, address the chair and I'll make you some soup.

Nick: No strings attached.

Well, except for the string of the chair.

All right.

Honesty, I'm, uh, sorry I ki...

You know what? I'm not.

I'm not sorry that I kissed your girlfriend.

'Cause, first of all, she wanted me to!

And it was fun.

It felt great.

And then we dated for a long time and that was fun.

You were out of the picture, not even in her thoughts.

It was a whole new thing. We just, we fell in love with each other, like crazy love... like, a lot of good memories, a lot of passion.

A lot of good sex.

Nick.

We once tried to sneak into the Kids' Choice Awards, and we got in and watched a bunch of kids get awards.

So, yeah.

Nick.

Topped...

Okay.

I have a fever of 103 and I'm talking to a chair and I'm not a great talk...

O-Okay.

Cool, cool.

Well, I think everything's good then.

Sam, I can feel you holding back.

If you can't be honest now in this strange place to that hideous chair, how can I trust you with my mind, my breasts and my precious yoni.

Sounds like it's full of yarn. (laughs)

Okay, fine. Honesty, all right, I... had a really hard time opening up to someone and then I met Jess and... and I thought we were...

We were great together.

And then Nick kissed her, and I-I went down kind of a weird path.

I gained 85 pounds.

And then I lost, like, 100.

I had no idea.

Poured almost all my money into silkworms.

They froze to death.

Now I'm doing yoga, meditation, and... I'm a vegan and I don't know.

What the hell have I become?

Look at these shoes, huh?

Look at these ridiculous shoes!

I like those shoes.

They're made from recycled shoes.

They are so dumb!

I don't know who I am!

I want to go back to who I was!

There he is.

The real Sam.

Wow!

(exclaiming)

What a breakthrough! Sam.

It is an honor to meet you.

I'm Genevieve.

And I am also dumping you.

Okay, that's great.

That's perfect, yeah.

As usual, I have had a terrible time in your horrible loft with all of you idiot people.

Sam, wait!

If you take your bike, will you relock mine?

Thank you.

Oh, Genevieve, I am so sorry.

Don't be, don't be.

I wanted a resolution and I got one.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to call my childhood phone number and scream at whoever picks up.

I'll see you Monday.

Wait, I got the job?

Of course you did.

This was one of the most profound Feelings Farm I have ever been a part of.

Radical, Jess, radical.

Uh, yeah, I have questions about where to park and stuff, but you know, I'll just, uh, I'll text you!

Ha!

(door closes)

What if the big letter comes back?

I can't believe it just took a high fever for me to like this show.

Not if it's silent!

Well, I hate it.

Why is the Crispy Castle bigger than Mount Tummy Tum?

It's dang gibberish.

How was your presentation?

(groans) Well, thank you for asking.

It was a disaster.

We can expect robust grow...

(snorts)

Are you holding in a sneeze?

(quietly): Mm-mm.

(quiet sneeze)

God, where did it even go?

(chuckles)

(sneezing)

Son of a bitch.

How did I get sick? I was so careful.

You did the best you could. I have no idea, man.

We're missing Poppycock.

You guys,

I hate that Sam's out there mad at me.

Because he's mad at you or because you still have feelings for him?

Because he's mad at me. If I could just...

All: Leave it alone. Leave it alone, Jess.

Right. You're right.

Wow, you shaved.

I mean, not "wow" like I like it.

I mean... I don't not like it.

What are you doing here? I, I don't want your cornbread.

It's not cornbread. It's, uh, it's brownies.

(laughs) Um...

Hey, I'm sorry we broke up.

And I think for me it was just... weird timing.

But I agree with you.

We were... great together.

Really great.

(both chuckle)

Get out of my life.

Big shift in tone there.

(sighs)

Eh, Nick'll eat 'em.





I need your advice on these wedding invites.

I like calligraphy option number two; it looks like a Bone Thugs album.

This looks like an ad for a bong company.

I like option one better.

Winston: You know what would be nice?

A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.

(chuckling)

What a magical wedding that would be.

You two are imbeciles.

Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.

Nick: Are you okay?

You look gray.

I didn't sleep.

I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.

I'm calling it D-Day.

Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions," and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.

That's incredibly offensive.

I know.

(door closes)

(shrieks)

Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?

Well, the girl they hired went missing and they need me to fill in!

Yeah! - What?

Oh!

Jess: Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!

That's right!

But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...

Cece, what are you talking about? Are you crazy?

You have to go to this.

I can do it all by my... by myself.

Are you okay?

(yawns)

Wow, your mouth has been open forever.

Okay, this is crazy. I'm just gonna stay home.

No, Cece, you have to go, please.

It's... it's...

Okay.

I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

I can help with wedding stuff.

Just lighten the load a little bit.

Sometimes I think I was bred in a lab to help people.

You know what else they bred in the lab?

Pugs.

Thank you, Jess. That would be great.

Uh, no, Cece.

I don't have time to bring her up to speed.

Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.

She would... just sh**t off.

Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?

Jess is just gonna help.

She's not gonna take over.

Mmm...

Jess...

Mmm... mm... mm... mmm.

What's happening here?

Fine.

Who's excited?

There we go.

Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.

Wait, what?

You're right. Not your job.

I've done it before.

I mean, I didn't like it, but...

I did it.

Am I proud of it? No.

Did I do it? Yes.

Have I done it again since? No.

There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.

I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.

Gonna be fine.

There's chairs to be picked and...

(yawns)

...cakes to be tasted.

Schmidt? Are you asleep?

What?!

No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!

Just tons... too much to do today to sleep.

Jess... this is the most important thing that I own.

It is the wedding flash drive.

Everything that you need to know is on this.

It's color-coded.

Ooh, color-coded. Gimme.

Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.

Treat it with respect.

I will, and I just want to say I'm honored you're trusting me.

Oh, I'm not.

Schmidt: Everything I see is terrible.

Pan left.

Jess: This one's nice.

Comfortable, but not too comfortable.

We want people to dance.

Folding chairs?

Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting, I would've called my Aunt Terry.

I don't think you want to marry this guy.

Who is that?

(Nick taps rhythmically on bar)

♪

Oh, finally.

Winston, where have you been?

I've been waiting an hour.

Work was crazy, okay?

I busted a poker room, which was a front for a cr*ck house, which was a front for a brothel.

It was a crime turducken.

This is the third time you've stood me up.

Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.

Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.

I'm gonna be a lawyer.

Let's eat.

I can't. I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.

I mean...

You know, it's a... it's a bar in the middle of the day. Like, who's there?

Why are they there? Why do you need to be there?

'Cause it's my job.

It runs itself.

It's basically a big-ass fridge.

I'm a bartender and owner.

You know how many b*lls I have to juggle now?

Man, those are baby b*lls.

Hmm.

I'm a cop.

I spend my day working the city's b*lls.

Listen to yourself.

Those b*lls are big.

Listen to yourself.

I'm listening to myself, Nick.

Your b*lls, in comparison to my b*lls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle...

If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?

Unless, of course, you're scared.

Scared?

Scared.

I'm a cop.

I run a bar.

Welcome to the nerve center.

Over here, you've got accounts payable... bills, to the layperson... and over here is the schedule.

It's a numbers game, really.

Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery...

That's great, Nick.

Um, I'm a cop.

(laughs)

(knocking at door)

Come in!

Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?

Nick: Oh, great, everybody's here.

Why don't you ask my friend Winston?

He'll be handling all questions.

Yeah, that's easy.

Jess: All right.

I'm ready to taste cakes.

Okay, great.

This is gonna be fun.

I'm sorry, fun?

Baking scones with Winston is fun.

This is serious, Jess.

Mmm!

Soft and sweet.

What a relief it's not hard and salty.

How is the nose?

Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?

Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.

Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.

You picked nothing.

You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.

Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.

And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.

No. I'm stopping this.

You're stop... you're stopping what?

J-Jess?

What are... what are you doing?

Why am I looking at a fountain now?

What...

What a relaxing water feature.

Hey, gal pal, how is it going?

Great! It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.

How's Schmidt?

He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?

No, everything's fine.

I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.

Seriously? I can come back and help.

No!

It's fine.

It's just...

Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.

Do you know which one beverages would be?

I don't know. Blue?

You're a genius. I found it.

Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.

(laughing): I told him that I know it.

Oh.

Good luck.

Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.

I didn't do it!

I'm lying.

I obviously did it.

Don't worry.

We just put those there for people to break.

Really?

No, they were very expensive.

But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?

I'm Gavin.

Let's try this one.

Tempting, but my friends are getting married.

I'm kind of on a deadline.

And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.

(gasps)

Just taste it.

Okay, one glass.

Javier, you take the early shift on... Saturday.

Ugh.

Come on, listen, I got to do what I got to do, you know?

Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.

Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?

My husband has his fantasy baseball league.

He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.

That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.

All right, where do you want these?

Winston, where do we want these?

Where do we want...? Winston? No, dude.

I don't know you like that, man.

Put 'em where the beer goes.

Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.

Look, I don't like the early shift.

(disgruntled chattering)

Mercy?

Yes! Yes, yes, man. That's what I thought.

Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.

Guys, the schedule.

Oh, that's perfect. Thanks.

That works?

Back to work, everybody. Good stuff.

Winston: Listen, I get it.

This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.

But come on.

Let's be real.

It's still not harder than being a cop.

Then prove it.

Oh, I'll prove it.

Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.

I just got a text from Javier that said, "f*re extinguisher" question mark.

Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.

It's about to be a bumpy ride.

(chuckles)

(whispering): Uh, where... where are my sunglasses?

How the hell should I know?

I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.

And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.

Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.

Do what you got to do, man.

Is this how all partners talk to each other?

(laughing): Welcome to hell, Miller.

I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine...

...or spending time with a beautiful stranger...

(giggles)

...that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.

Mmm.

Mm-hmm.

How do you feel about a little manchego?

I feel very good about it.

We're not animals.

(chuckles) Or maybe we are.

(both laugh)

Have you ever...?

Hmm?

(both laugh)

I have too much manchego.

Happens to the best of us.

Have you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?

Yes.

(door opens)

Ah.

Jess, thank you.

You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.

Everything's under control. The bakery's sending over three cakes for you to try.

Okay.

And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.

Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?

I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.

(shrieking)

No!

Ugh!

Schmidt, what happened? What's wrong?

(whispering): You just made out with my dad.

(shrieking)

Schmidt.

(shushing)

Can I just say one thing?

(shushing)

(door opens)

Hey, guys.

So, how did it go today?

Good.

We got a lot accomplished.

But, um... how do I say this? Um...

I made out with Schmidt's dad.

You did what?

She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.

You did what?

If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.

You need better labels.

Schmidt: Everything is perfectly clear.

Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."

Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.

The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.

Is he a good kisser?

Don't ask that, plea... And don't you answer it.

(stammers) It's withdrawn. I'm just freaking out right now.

Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?

What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?

Why?

Why would I talk to my dad?

He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.

And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up: middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.

Well, he's taken up surfing now.

Oh, he's taken up surfing? How nice.

A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.

What a hero.

Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?

Because I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened, I can very well see that I'm not ready.

So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.

I'm sorry! He was feeding me cheese, and I...

I d... Ugh.

Please stop.

Please. So many details.

Please.

And-and God for... if you...

Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth, I'm gonna freak out!

Oh, thank God, Winston.

You're saving the city from a palm frond.

Los Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.

All right, it was a slow-ass day.

Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?

No, I'm not getting involved in this.

I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.

Did you say "yard"? Wow, who are you dating?

Tape measure, fine.

Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.

Dispatcher: 7-8-6-3.

Possible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.

Hell yes.

4-2-4 responding. Over.

Bar boy, get in.

Aly, let's lock and load.

Is your g*n not loaded?

You have to load your g*n, Winston.

(knocking on door)

Oh, no.

Schmidt, um, that's your dad.

Both: What?

What-what is my dad doing at our front door?

He thinks we're going on a date.

Why would he think that, Jess?

Because I said, "Let's go on a date."

I'll get rid of him. Go to your room and close the door.

Do not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.

(gasps)

Oh, that's disgusting.

Just go. Go.

Wait. Wait, wait.

I don't trust you.

♪

Hey, Gavin!

Nick: I know what this is.

I'm not falling for it.

You don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.

Stay here. Make yourself as small a target as possible.

I'll just be here napping out of boredom.

Winston (on radio): I see signs of forced entry.

Wait, wait, wait, wait! I got movement!

I'm shaking in my boots!

Oh, yeah, right, he's ru... No!

Aly: Halt! Police!

(shouting)

(screaming)

Aah!

No! Get away! Get out!

(Taser buzzing, man screaming)

Okay, I get it!

Your job is way harder than mine!

Just make the bad man go away!

What?

Put the g*n down!

Yeah, my job is much harder!

(screams)

We're gonna make him go away!

(Nick shouting)

Can't stand to see Nick like this, you know.

At least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.

We all got to learn that lesson sometime.

Idiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.

He just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.

Oh.

(quiet laugh)

Why are you looking at me like that?

No, no, I... (stammers)

That's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!

You shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.

Come on, yeah.

No! No!

Hey, scoot over.

No, not in here! Not in here, no! No!

You have the right to remain silent.

No! No!

Gavin: What are you doing with a video camera on your head?

He is handsome.

Jess: That's a good question.

Oh, hey, look.

That's-that's good news for you, okay.

It's for work.

I still hate him.

They want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.

I'm an educator, so...

Oh, you told me.

I believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.

(groans) He's a bottom?

You want to give me the tour?

Or should we just cr*ck this open and make out?

What a line.

Who is this clown?

Bottle opener in here?

Well... oh.

Oh, actually, um, change of plans... I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.

No pressure.

It's just that I had a lot of fun today.

And, uh, I'd like to see you again.

(shouts)

What was that?

Oh.

g*n... the neighborhood's in a real slide.

This is my son's name.

7 billion people.

There's got to be some overlap.

We'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.

Wait a minute.

'Cause...

This is my son!

Oh, my God, do you know my son?

Kind of.

Does he live here?

Uh...

Is he here right now?

I didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.

And you didn't know I was his roommate.

And those are facts that will haunt us forever.

(chuckles)

But I can't let you go in there.

Because... he's not ready to see you.

And for once today, I...

Okay.

I want to respect his wishes.

I get it.

Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.

No, I'll go.

Wait, wait.

What?

He's in there.

Shh.

She told him.

Son?

Babe, I think you should watch.

I don't...

Son.

You should watch.

I know you're mad. I get it.

Do you want me to take this off?

I didn't do a good job being your father.

You're in a zone. I'm just gonna sit tight.

And now you're getting married.

I get it.

I wouldn't have invited me, either.

I've missed a lot.

I'm sorry.

In my defense, I was stoned for most of the '90s.

And the 2000s.

Full disclosure... I was stoned this morning.

I like weed.

But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little, I'd love to have a drink with you.

And meet the man that you've become.

Come on.

Gavin.

That's okay... Gavin, not Dad.

That's just where I'm at right now.

Understood.

I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.

I wanted to say I'm sorry.

And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.

(groans) But in the past ten years, I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.

I really am sorry.

Gavin, this is my fiancée Cece.

She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.

It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.

I'm the terrible father.

Thank you.

Because whatever you did or didn't do, Schmidt turned out amazing.

All right.

I'm gonna head out.

I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.

I wasn't very good at being married.

But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.

For what it's worth, I like the second option.

Timeless.

I agree.

Good-bye.

Okay, wa... uh... (clears his throat)

Wait, uh...

Here, that's for you.

Let's see if you can show up this time.

I hope that you do.

Thank you.

There's no plus one, so don't even ask.

I'll be there.

(sighs)

Back to square one on the seating chart.

Oh!

Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.

God, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.

You know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!

It'd be a great idea.

Hello, Hollywood!

It's a big show!

Yeah, it's a h*t.

I want to apologize.

I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.

It's not. I'm just making schedules and buying beer.

Look, man. (chuckles)

The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.

You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.

Yes, that's a fact. We all know it.

But I got to say, man, this is first time I've seen you really care about your job.

(chuckles)

You're k*lling it.

It means a lot to me that you said that.

So thank you.

Yeah, yeah.

So, look, I got... I got us burgers.

Oh!

You know, I figured we're both too busy for steak.

(both laugh)

The tradition!

Nick, I need a drink.

It'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.

Schmidt, are you okay?

I mean, you look a little freaked...

Oh... oh-oh, Cece!

Cece's pregnant!

No.

Ow.

Jess made out with Schmidt's dad.

Oh, my God!

So many emotions.

♪ Got an old hound dog ♪
♪ Bobby Joe is his name ♪
♪ Got an old hound dog... ♪

Well, I mean, did you like it?

Don't answer that.

Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.

You're not answering the question.

No, she's not answering the question.

Sweetie, you don't have to say anything.

I liked it a little bit.

(guys groaning, clamoring)

Dude.





Okay, well, it's too small to be a cat hotel and it's too big to be pants.

So it's not mine.

Me neither. I pick up all my deliveries at the port.

The what? At the port?

Yeah.

What are you doing at the port?

Picking up my deliveries. Listen.

(short chuckle)

You drive all the way down to the port?

Yes.

Well, it's not mine. I only buy local.

Except, of course, for clothing and produce. Medication, water, seasoning, meat.

Maybe it's Cece's.

Isn't she packing up her apartment?

It's not Cece's.

She's packing right now, and Jess is going over there later to toast the place good-bye. 'Cause they're adorable.

Would you consider us adorable?

No, we're adult men.

We're cute.

Oh, hey!

My box is here.

Do you need help?

Oh...

Yeah, I was just gonna put it... Put it down right there.

Awesome.

Jess, is it me, or has your job become a poo poo festival?

No, it's fine. It's just the new principal, Becky Cavatappi.

She took over for Foster when he retired. I do all her work and she does all the working of her cleavage.

But the budget's your job, Becky.

Ah... Principal Cavatappi.

Like I always say: don't call me Becky unless you're riding me like a horse.

(laughs)

We work in a middle school.

Really.

This is the budget, or the next week of my life.

You know what they say... your life is just weeks and then you die.

Uh, Jess, are you sure you're okay?

Yeah.

I just got this for a little stress relief.

(laughs)

Oh, Schmidt, will you be a dear and text Cece and tell her I'm gonna be about, like, ten minutes late?

Yeah, sure.

Thanks.

Aah!

(grunting, screaming)

Becky! Becky!

I hate you!

(screaming)

(knocking)

Hi!

Hello.

Look who I brought. The French.

Bonjour. Oh, it's Prosecco, it's Italian.

So grazie.

Oh, it's Polish Prosecco.

So that's on me for buying it at a gas station.

Long week of work ahead of me.

I'm looking forward to a fun night!

Okay, Jess, I should tell you before I...

I know I said I was done packing, but I'm not done, and the reason I'm not done is because I didn't do anything, and I have to get out before tomorrow, otherwise I lose my deposit.

Oh, Cece.

I know.

Cece, Cece, Cece.

Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece...

Hey, guys.

Hey, Winston.

I did it. I told Aly I need a new partner.

What? I thought you had a crush on her.

Yeah.

Well, exactly. You know, here's the problem.

She keeps talking about her boyfriend and his "ass that you want to open on Christmas."

What?

But it's fine.

You know, she took it better than I thought.

Screw you.

Here's your crap: lucky crystal, key chain fart marker, over a hundred yogurt tops, your flattened penny collection, a signed copy of a Paul Reiser biography, baby carrot thumb drive, a picture of you and Dave Coulier, loose Pez, my mom's cell number, a ticket stub from Urinetown.

When did you even see that?

Why? Why?

Oh, have you...

Have you tried 'em on?

Oh, and your Pure Mood CD.

This thing makes me want to swim into a boat motor.

(phone dings)

Oh... new partner's here.

Guys, as they say, when one chapter ends, a bridge appears, and then you cross that bridge and make lemonade out of a molehill.

Okay.

Hiya, partner. (laughs)

That's, uh, "hi" in karate. Hiya!

(both laughing)

That's cool.

You don't mind if we listen to some car jams, do you?

Well, man, let's just get right to track seven.

♪ Elations ♪

♪ Elation ♪

♪ Elations ♪

Elation.

♪ Elation, elation ♪

Elation.

(both laugh)

Oh!

I'm okay, it's fine, it's fine, yeah.

You okay, you good?

It's not gonna end well for these two.

I wouldn't trust him to watch a ball pit.

Hey, could I get a cream soda?

Dude, we both know what you're gonna do.

Don't. It's not cool.

What? We have a flasher.

You know what, maybe if we get drunk, then magically everything will just happen.

No, no.

No drinking until you've packed.

Look, I get that you're freaking out about moving, but we can do this. We need to make a keep pile and a toss pile, okay?

Keep or toss, keep or toss.

(phone dings)

Ugh.

Uh... Hi, Becky. Sorry, Principal Cavatappi.

Jess, remember that binder?

Yeah. Yup, I've got it right here.

I'll have it done by the end of the week.

Yeah, I mixed up the budget due date.

I took my contacts out 'cause they're ugly.

So I kind of can't read stuff.

I'll need it tomorrow.

Um... Uh, yeah, uh, but it's a week's worth of work.

You get it done or you're fired. (hangs up)

I have to do a week's worth of work in a night.

So we got to get through this quick.

Keep or toss, keep or toss.

Cece, that sweatshirt has a wine stain on it and an off-brand Looney Tunes character.

George Bunny? Who the hell is that?

You're right. Keep.

Toss!

No, keep, keep!

I'm calling the cops. There is a man pulling out his privates in our bar.

Oh, big whoop.

It used to be worse. It used to be more interactive.

What do mean, interactive?

Interactive.

You showed, too?

No, it was more like tennis, like... (snaps fingers)

Exit.

What's the second... (snaps fingers)

(snapping fingers)

Now it's just... (snaps fingers)

And I'm...

This is a problem. Wi-Winston.

New partner is working out great, man.

You know, we have a lot in common.

Both have cats, both partially blind... me, color, him, night.

Well, that sounds dangerous. Winston, listen to me.

We have some very serious police business here.

The bar has a flasher. A strange man is regularly showing Nick his funky soup bone.

I'm sure he doesn't even care.

I care about that greatly, Nick. I will be right there.

Whoa, partner.

Oh, oh, oh, my goodness. Hey, didn't see...

Seat's taken. the seat was taken there, Winston, I...

Yeah, I usually ride g*n because I get motion sickness as a decision-maker.

Yeah, well, I lose all hand strength with absolutely no warning. Just...

Damn it.

Mm... I'm sorry, I'll be fast. Mm...

Mm...

Mm...

Time's up. It's a toss.

No, that was actually an award.

Toss. Next.

Jessica...

Now, okay, look, that hat has a very important memory.

Hey.

I-I'm sorry I'm so bad at doggy-style.

Do you really want to remember Sir Miss-A-Lot?

This is all important stuff from my single life.

I think I need to go through the pile again.

You know what, you're right. Let's go through everything again.

Can you just come with me to the hallway and take a look at a pile I made out there?

Oh, yeah, okay.

I just really appreciate it.

Mm-hmm.

I know you got a lot of work to do.

Yeah, so it's...

(gasps)

I have to finish packing so I can work on the binder!

You made me do this! I'm shutting this tiny door!

Jessica, open the door!

You're a terrible packer!

Jessica, open the door!

Your favorite team is the Green Bay... Not Packers.

Let me in, okay? Because, you know, if I'm out here too long, I'm gonna run into...

Hey, neighbor, you dig turtles?

It's not a big deal.

I've been flashed by, like, seven or eight different people since college.

What?

You guys have been flashed?

No.

Never.

Everybody's been flashed countless times, right?

No.

Oh, it's just me who's been flashed about 300 times?

What?

You guys have never been flashed?

No.

Never.

Not even on, like, holidays?

Both: No!

Not even, like, after the Olympics?

Hey, guys, I still can't find the bathroom.

Where did you guys say it was again?

This place is like a maze.

Dunston, it's... it's one big room, buddy.

Never mind. I don't have to go anymore.

No, no, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.

You've had, like, two tubs of soda. You-you need to go.

Yeah, I do have to go.

It's right back there to the left.

Okay.

Yeah, right past the pop...

Someone call about a flasher?

Oh.

Just responding to a call about a flasher.

Oh, yes. Uh, there is no need.

Dunston and I have got this, so...

Oh, how is Dunston?

Huh? I hear he's blind and weird.

No. No, he's great.

Ah.

Dunston gets it done... ston.

And that's how we win.. ston!

(laughing) Oh.

(laughing)

How are you?

Really good.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, Hutch is one hell of a cop.

Hutch: I'm very strong.

Punch my stomach. Try.

I mean, I will.

It won't hurt.

(laughing): Okay.

It won't hurt.

(laughing): God.

Mm-hmm.

That's amazing.

Dunston. Bathroom.

Yeah?

Oh, that's right.

Dunston?

Ah.

Dunston?

No, I know.

(laughing)

You're in good hands.

I hope you're happy, too.

Great!

Great!

Great.

Great!

Somebody call the G8 Summit because I just felt the climate change.

I don't get that.

Hmm. Excuse me.

You know where the bathroom is?

It's not back here.

Right.

If you throw out one more thing, I am gonna hurl my body against the door!

Okay, fine, I am gonna do it.

I hope I don't hurt myself!

(crying): Ow!

You think I don't know those were hands?

That was a slap sound!

Yeah.

Okay, you're right, it's a slapping sound, but I-I think I overdid it and I really hurt my wrist.

It's, like, swelling.

I'm telling the truth, okay? It really hurts.

Just, can you please open the door?

And now my wrists are fine!

(screaming)

You snake! You rattlesnake!

Cece: Oh, my God, everything's gone.

Look, Cece, I know you're freaking out about leaving the apartment, but if you think of it like...

No. It's just, it's not just the apartment.

It's just... it's... it's all of it.

Everything is changing!

I'm not gonna have this place anymore, and I'm getting married.

(sighs)

Oh, my God, Jess, I'm getting married.

Are you having second thoughts?

No, no. I... I know I want to marry Schmidt more than anything in the world.

It's just... everything is gonna change, and I am scared.

Oh, honey.

Oh, my little breakfast link.

Okay, now, look, we don't have time for this.

Okay, you have to work on your binder.

(sighs)

Forget the binder.

Right now this is more important.

So you know what we're gonna do?

What?

We're gonna get into it!

I'm gonna take my pants off!

What? Why?

So, Nick, can you describe the suspect?

Mr. Miller, can you describe the suspect?

Uh, are you doing the interview, or...?

Oh, yeah, I'm usually the interview guy.

Oh, that's okay.

No, you can take it.

I'll take it, dude, if it's not a big deal.

Hey, well, it can be either...

No, I'm used to it, too, but you're used to it, so it's not a big deal for me.

Well, I mean, I'm used to it, but I'm open to new things.

Okay, yeah, but to the count of three.

Just-just-just please...

We're just gonna do it.

Both: One, two, three.

You do it.

I can... I'm gonna go.

He was average size, thin, wispy blond hair.

Oddly shaped, kind of came to a point.

Uh, what does that mean?

Top heavy.

A bit of a scar as if like from a hook or something.

Gross. Ugh. Uh, anything else?

I think that about does it. You want me to describe what his face and body looked like?

Yeah, that'd be... Wait.

Have you been describing his penis this whole time?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

I'm not even the one that called you guys.

Man!

And to be fair, I knew he was talking about a penis the whole time.

See?

That is way too real!

Aggressively detailed.

I had to guess on the testicles, 'cause he hadn't described 'em.

You know what it is? It's just that there's no turning back.

I mean, who am I when I leave this apartment?

"Mrs. Cece Schmidt?"

"Cece Schmidt" sounds like the mayor of an evil Swiss town.

(laughter) It does.

Oh, my God.

Did I tell you that Schmidt thinks that we should drop our last names and make up a new one?

He is currently, at the moment, leaning towards Zenith and Telluride.

I don't hate Telluride.

Getting married is just such a big leap.

You leap big all the time!

You moved here at 18 with nothing but a bunch of chokers.

Isn't it amazing?!

And it's mine.

Yeah, there's also a Kn*fe stuck in the wall.

Oh, look!

Someone left a spoon with some rock candy in it.

I wonder what flavor it is.

This is a way bigger leap.

(phone plays tune)

Ugh! Becky! You sloppy boob lizard!

Principal Cavatappi!

Oh, yeah, the binder. Yup, I've got it right...

...here.

(whispers): Where's the binder?

(gasps)

Um, yeah, uh, sorry. Uh...

Um, yeah, I've got it right here.

(whispering): Find it. Find it.

You packed it somewhere?!

Yeah, I can turn to page 13. Hold on.

Oh. Chuka.

Chuka, chuka, chuka.

Chuka.

(whispering): What is that?

That was a page-turning noise.

Chuka, chuka...

Um, yup, I see the graph.

Chuk, chuka, chuk, chuk!

Jess?

(sighs)

Do you remember Rosarito?!

We don't have much to go on, but I'll run your description.

Hopefully, Dunston wouldn't have spilled coffee all over the radio.

You know, he brews his own and drinks it out of a sandwich bag.

Schmidt: Winston, just call Aly and tell her that you want to be partners again.

Ugh. Look, guys, I...

I cannot.

I just cannot hear about Aly's boyfriend and his ass that don't quit, okay?

My ass don't quit! What about my ass?!

Winston, please call Aly.

Seriously, dude.

There he is.

Flasher: Hey, do you have any, uh...?

Freeze, buddy!

Oh, yeah, freeze!

Wait! Hey! (groans)

Oh.

Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

(grunting, thudding)

Yeah! Got him! (laughing)

All right! Dunston!

Oh, yes.

Yeah, man. I'm not normally the cuff guy, but I'll do it.

Yeah, me, either.

But I'll do it.

One size fits all, right?

Yeah, I guess it's...

Man, I just said, I'll be the cuff guy!

I'm not normally the cuff...

But, yeah, but if I'm not normally the...

Then if you're not... but I'm not normally.

Now, I'm doing...

Okay, okay, count of three. Count of three.

Who is the cuff guy? One.

All right. One.

Both: Two, three, four.

Five, six. See?

Five. Mm.

(overlapping chatter)

All right. Three.

Three.

Both: Two, one, zero, negative one. Damn it!

That...!

Winston, Dunston! Dunston!

Go! Hey!

(both grunt)

(sighs)

I got to say... he never comes in twice in a night.

I just hope he's okay.

I'm alarmed by how connected to this man you feel.

I just hope the best for him.

I am so d*ad.

If I don't find this binder, I'm gonna need a really good excuse. Oh, wait, Cece?

Mm.

Can you break my arm just a little bit?

No!

You're right. It's better if I do it myself.

Okay, you know what? Hey!

Hey, can I just throw something out there?

What if you quit?

I want to quit.

God, do I want to quit, but I can't! I can't!

You can quit. Because this Becky lady is making you miserable.

You were always someone who loved their job.

I don't leap.

I take small planned steps, like an arthritic dog.

Really?

The last listing is a loft downtown.

Bad area.

The ad just says it's "sunsoaked and beige-y."

I don't know. They seem like three nice girls.

And now I am marrying one of those girls and totally freaking out about it.

You know who you need to talk to, right?

Yes. Definitely. Winston.

No.

What the hell?

What?

I'm gone for two months, and all of a sudden Winston's a bridesmaid? Never mind.

You need to call Schmidt.

No.

No, I can't call him and tell him that I'm scared.

I think that that's what getting married is.

Sharing all this, all the things you're afraid of, all the things that embarrass you, weak doggy-style guy.

You got to call Schmidt.

All right.

(phone rings)

A voice call, Jess?

Let me guess, a family of ducks is crossing the street.

No, no, no, no, no, no. It's me. It's me. Um, so... okay, um, I love you but I am freaking out about getting married.

Cece, what? What's-what's going on? What's happening?

Well, I just... I don't... I don't...

(phone chimes)

Oh, no. Um, Jess, it's Becky. It's Becky.

What-what-what do you want me to do?

What do I do? What do I do?

Don't answer it. Don't answer it.

What? Who's Becky? What's a Becky? What's happening?

(phone chiming)

Don't answer it.

Do not answer it.

I'm gonna answer it.

What?

Hello! Hi. Uh, yeah, so, this is Cece Parikh, and you are treating my friend very badly.

What? Put Jess on.

No, no, no, no. You are done using my friend, okay?

So she... quits.

I what?

She what?

I what?

That's right!

Jess quits!

Nailed it!

Oh, my God, the binder. It's under the couch.

No, no, no. We handled it.

It's our perp.

Aly, I want you back. I...

I-I want you back.

Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?

I miss having you as my partner.

(scoffs) Do you want to tell me why you left?

'Cause you never did. And, honestly, Winston, that really sucked.

I left because you hurt my feelings when you kept talking about...

You kept talking about...

...how much you hate my music. You know?

This is about your Pure Moods CD?

That's it. That's all. It's the only reason why I left.

Okay. I mean, that thing makes me wish I was born without the ability to hear music, but if it means that much to you, I'll listen to it.

I-I-I appreciate that.

Look, you're the only partner I want.

You make me... laugh and whatever.

I don't know. I suck at compliments.

Yeah.

Partners?

Partners.

Shake it. Don't just hold it.

Yeah. Sorry.

(panting)

I think that was Dunston.

How did he not see us?

No idea.

Oh, yeah, he's night-blind.

Dunston!

It's done. Everything you asked for.

And, Principal Cavatappi, I'm very sorry for what my friend said. I...

Oh, I know. I would never let you quit anyway.

Can you come up with some thoughts on the science curriculum for the superintendant and sign my name?

Yeah.

Sure. Yes.

You know what? No!

I can't. (chuckles) No.

Nope. Um, because I quit.

I hope you have a minor career setback, learn from it, relocate, and ultimately have a very nice life, Becky.

(groans)

Mmm.

Do I want to know this story?

(chuckles) I hope so, because we're about to spend the rest of our lives together.

So you're gonna have to hear all my stories.

I want to spend the rest of my life hearing all your stories.

Until, of course, my hearing goes out and I get tinnitus. Do you know Dave Letterman has tinnitus?

Um...

About-about what I said on the phone...

I'm a little freaked out, too.

You are?

Yes.

And it has nothing to do with how much I love you.

Exactly.

Or how much I want to get married.

Exactly.

We'll be scared together.

And we'll be really happy together, too.

And we'll be really annoyed together, knowing that we're living with three other people and a cat.

Also, I think there's another cat.

Winston's being very evasive about it, but...

Mmm.

It's a foster cat.

I think it's helping him get over the whole Aly thing.

I don't care.

Well, I guess this is it.

I thought Jess would be here, but... you know, okay, end of an era.

Yeah.

(quietly): Have you ever been here before?

This is maybe my second time.

I nursed my pippy back to health here.

(chuckling): Yeah. I remember.

All right. I'm gonna give you a minute.

Okay.

(sighs)

Jess: Cece, Cece, Cece.

Do you want to do the honors or should I?

Hmm... Go for it.

(exhales)

Cece: Okay. One, two, three.

(chuckles) We did it!

(chuckles)

Jess: Oh, my God, there's hair on the end!

(gasps) Put it back! Put it back!

(door opens)

(sniffles)

Jess: Do you speak Russian?

Cece: Nope.





So your flight leaves tomorrow, so...

Yes, if we're ever gonna have sex, we gotta do it right now.

Now, what-what I was actually gonna say is do you want to print your boarding pass at the airport and use their ink instead of ours, but I like that yours ended with sex.

I said sex, but I meant meaningless sex.

Oh, I heard that. That's what I heard.

I heard meaningless sex.

I'm gonna be in my room.

Yeah, I'm right behind you.

Time-wise. I'm not pitching positions.

Okay, great.

Holy...

Jess: Hi!

Oh, my God!

I am so sorry.

Nobody was here when I got home, and the bed just looked so good, I went full Goldilocks, and you must be Reagan!

It's so good to meet you.

I put on my special underwear, because...

Nick!

Jess is back!

And I made a promise to myself when you left I'd be wearing these when you came back!

And I'm doing it.

Oh, my God! Thank you!

I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

All right, great, I'm gonna get out of here.

No, stay.

Nah! Nah!

Jess: The LA County Courthouse gift shop is straight up bull.

Can you believe I had to have these shirts made?

Yeah, I can believe that.

Where's Reagan? Probably putting on her shirt still.

Yeah, Reagan's not exactly the matching T type.

I-I feel like the moment has passed, don't you?

Yeah, I feel like it's so passed.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

That's the thing about moments, though.

They come and they go. They're fleeting.

That's a moment.

This is a moment.

Which makes me believe that although that one passed, maybe it...

It's also just, um, I'm leaving tomorrow.

Yeah.

So we don't want to make it complicated.

I mean, right now we're just roommates that made out a couple of times.

Well, I'm glad we talked this out.

Now your last day here won't be weird.

Nothing about this conversation makes me believe that that is true.

(snaps)

Yeah.

(sighs, scoffs)

(snaps)

Glad it's not gonna be weird.

Winston's weekly letters.

90% redacted, but still full of news.

"I'll leave you with my thoughts on the trial."

Big black line, big black line.

They redacted that stuff?

Big black line.

"LOL." Big black line.

"Gotta go, or I'll be late for my first dance class."

You know, actually the dance class has become more of a dance gathering.

You know what, maybe Schmidt and I will join you, because the wedding is almost here, and we have to work on our first dance.

Come. I mean, you know, two more referrals and I get to have my birthday party there.

Jess: Hey, Reagan.

Hello.

How was jury duty?

Jury duty was quite simply the tops.

Did I have a knack for it?

I suppose. Was I elected foreman?

Unanimously.

Am I going on the news tomorrow to explain the verdict to laymen non-jurors? (chuckles)

You know I am.

(chuckles) Nice!

And yet, I nearly threw it all away for love.

His name was Juror 237B, and we made the courthouse our hothouse.

Blood splatters, mucous seeps.

Jess: But nothing could happen between us, because, as every American knows, personal contact through the exchange of personal information between members of a sequestered jury is strictly forbidden.

But I promised myself, once the trial had ended, I would find him.

Extra! Extra!

"I'm gonna find that juror," vows Jessica Day!

Page two: It's w*r in the Pacific!

What?!

Nick: Schmidt...

I... Schmidt!

I need your help.

This is Reagan's last day.

I know it is, and you know what?

Whatever embarrassments or failures the rest of your life may hold, no one can ever take away what you've accomplished this week.

A goddess walked among us, and you went to first base with her.

Several times.

And I actually did a really good job kissing her.

But now I'm making it weird.

No.

Yeah, every time I open my mouth, I'm tarnishing my legacy a little bit.

But I have a plan. I'm gonna shut up.

Love it.

I'm not finished yet. There's more to my plan.

Do you need more?

Yes, I need more.

What more could there be? Just shut up.

I'm going to shut up until we say good-bye.

And then...

I'm gonna h*t her with a Goosebumps Walkaway.

I don't know who he is.

Is he an old-fashioned baseball player?

Goosebumps Walkaway is the line that they guy says to the girl in the movie that gives her goosebumps and then he walks away forever.

It's that line that...

That haunts her.

That consumes her.

That rings in her ear for all of eternity, granting you...

Both (whispering): Immortality.

You're damn right.

Immortality.

Come here. I want to say good-bye to you.

But it's not true.

So-so bad-bye, Reagan.

Bad... bye.

Okay, that was terrible.

Now, go write 20 more.

Learn them, inhabit them, practice them, and then throw those away.

Then write another 20 and submit them to me for my approval.

Can bad-bye be one of them?

No.

So 40 new ones.

Yeah.

That's too... that's excessive.

Reagan: So, what is your plan for finding this guy?

I'm typing words I know about him into a computer.

(typing)

Handsome plus Los Angeles plus 237B...

(sighs) ...is a d*ad end.

Not if you're looking for Japanese adult film star, Handsome Los Angeles.

Born in February of 1937?

Handsome, tell me your secrets.

Looks like you are figuring that out.

So I'm gonna go anywhere else.

(knocking on door)

Hey, Jess.

Hi.

Hey, Reagan.

Wow, you were in here.

I was, yeah.

Anybody else back there? (forced laughter)

If there was, I'd be terrified.

It's a small space.

So you and Jess are just talking.

I can only imagine what you guys are talking about.

Well...

I can't stand it for another second.

I have to address the 800-pound gorilla that's in this room.

It's elephant in the room.

800-pound gorilla is a different thing.

Okay, I guess I have to address the 800-pound elephant that's in the middle of the room.

It's just elephant. The 800 pounds, that goes with the gorilla thing.

800 pounds is not a very big elephant.

Jess! Reagan and I were romantic together.

Ooh.

I didn't know that.

Which means I've been romantic with both of you.

Cool.

And it's not just because you have brown hair and you've shared this room.

But because you're great, top-shelf ladies.

And I had the opportunity, and so I reached in the cookie jar, and I grabbed a chocolate chip and an oatmeal.

And I'm not saying who's who.

(sighs) I've gotten off-track.

Your worlds must be turned absolutely upside down.

This must be devastating, as it is to me.

We're all feeling emotions we couldn't even begin to discuss.

A lot of us are having bad anxiety, and our legs are feeling weird and tingly.

I think we're fine with it.

I think it's great.

I'm really glad I came in here and, uh, talked about this.

I feel like we've gotten a lot of... Great.

Mm-hmm.

Well...

Winston! (chuckles)

I didn't hear Winston.

He just screamed my name.

He needs help.

All right, I'm coming to save you.

That's the most embarrassed I've ever been for anyone not doing improv.

He's being so weird.

I gotta get out of here for the day.

Well, how would you like to drive around Los Angeles and look for a juror?

♪ Thank you for being Reagan ♪
♪ Travel to the car ♪
♪ And find a juror ♪
♪ Your heart is true, but you're not walking fast enough. ♪

You and Nick, tell me everything.

The power went out.

We went into the basement.

There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.

(squealing softly): Oh, my God.

And you like him.

No. No, I don't.

We just hooked up a few times.

Let's focus on you.

Here's a courtroom sketch.

Yep, there he is, 237B.

God, he can dress.

But we're gonna need more than that.

We need something distinctive, so did he have like a... he walked with a limp or he had a hook hand or a neck tattoo... anything?

No. (chuckles)

He was perfect.

We all were.

Except for the guy sitting next to him, 9C... ugh.

Reagan: What was wrong with him?

He never got why Bunt v. Che was a relevant precedent.

Also he wheezed... a lot.

Like the door of a haunted house.

He has asthma.

We can find that guy and see if he knows anything.

I used to peddle inhalers. What color was his?

Oh, uh... red.

Like the door of a haunted house!

Sorry. (laughs)

The only group excursion we took was to a haunted house.

By the way, if you like haunted houses but hate lines, January's a great time to go...

Dr. Foley?

Reagan Lucas.

I was just calling to ask you if you were still handing out samples of Ciliabreez?

Six months after the recall?

Oh, dang.

Jim?

Nothing more bad-ass than calling a doctor by his first name.

(shushing)

Sorry.

All I need from you is the name of a patient.

(Digital Underground's "The Humpty Dance" playing)

Schmidt: What is this, Winston?

Who are all these unusual people?

Where's the instructor?

It is a gathering, not a class.

I've told you that before.

Listen, it's fun.

That's not dancing. These people aren't dancing.

Dancing is about precision and domination and sweat.

Check out my ass. Check out my ass!

My butt is alive! (whoops)

(dancers clamoring)

Schmidt: We're not gonna learn our first dance here.

I'm gonna call my Beijing Opening Ceremonies contact.

He's fantastic.

No, no, no.

Look, I always imagined that our first dance would just be you and me having the time of our lives.

Very choreographed time of our lives.

No.

Having fun... that's how I want to start our lives together.

Can you please just try?

Please?

Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll try.

Just listen to the music.

Let it build.

Let it build.

Got to let it wash over you... Oh, there's the wave!

Let it wash over me on the three count?

Yes!

I think so.

It's happening. It's happening.

Well, just teach me the steps and I'd be happy to join in.

There are no steps.

What dance are you guys doing?

Because it is not Humpty's!

♪ This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name... ♪

This is his dance, y'all!

And Humpty Hump is his name!

During Cece's first wedding, Nick and I went into a duct to catch a badger that Winston had released.

Naturally.

It was crazy!

It was chaotic!

It was largely Nick's fault.

But then I realized he's the only person I'd ever go into a duct with.

Nick kind of sneaks up on you.

You think he's one thing... and then...

Yeah, Nick is great.

But I'm leaving and we're both cool about that so...

Oh, right, you're both totally cool about it.

I get Goosebumps Walka... Okay, okay, just think... okay.

Oh, wait, Reagan, before you go!

"Wherever the fridge of life takes you..."

You came in, I liked you, then you left!

What, what is that...?!

Stop thinking... that this is good-bye.

And start knowing it as... bye... bye.

Pretend I didn't do the "byes."

Reagan: So, Dr. Foley says our guy spends all of his time here.

With all this grass, no wonder his asthma is bad.

Jess: Oh, hey!

There he is!

Hey, 9C!

Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no!

You do not run my life anymore. Good-bye!

Is that adult man afraid of you?

I take a bathroom break when I want to!

I cracked skulls as foreman.

Whoa, whoa.

Jess: "Men only"?!

It's 2016!

Clearly, I make the rules.

That's why my office is a hut.

Fine, we'll get a man.

So, Winston didn't answer.

Schmidt said, "They're desecrating the Time Warp.

Desecrating it!" And he hung up.

But I got a hold of Nick.

He said that he's super busy, which means he's naked and doodling.

But he said he'd make time for us, which is good.

Wait, sorry, so Nick is coming?

Yeah.

No, just call him and tell him not to come.

I thought you were cool.

I am cool.

You don't really seem cool.

It's just that when I see him, it's a, it's weird, Mm-hmm.

'cause I'm, I'm leaving and it's, it's complicated.

I do... I just, I don't really know how to...

Right.

God, I'm crazy about him!

Yes! I knew it!

I knew it.

Okay, yes.

That's enough. You're right.

You know what happens now.

I don't want to hug you.

You know what happens now!

I'm not hugging you.

Yeah, you are.

I'm not hugging you.

You know the other juror's name?

I think it was 237B.

What's that guy's name, yeah?

Oh, yeah, no.

I really, really can't. It's like...

Nah...

I like that guy, really?

What's the name of the juror?

No!

Calls hand sanitizer "ham sanitizer."

Tell me the name and I'll give you the hat!

Quit it! Quit it!

He calls DNA "D and A."

You want grass stain on this white hat?!

Please no.

But he kisses you like a coal miner greeting his wife.

After a day in the caves.

Did they go into caves?

237B is Gary Garcia!

Gary?

I'm not jumping this! Let's go!

You get back here!

Gary Garcia!

Schmidt: Look at her out there.

Treating the laws of music as mere suggestions of music.

Must be frightening to love a daredevil.

What happened to you?

Growing up a husky boy, I learned that I had no margin for error.

(Van McCoy's "The Hustle" playing)

Hey, fatty, it's called "The Hustle."

(laughter)

Schmidt: The slightest mistake meant ridicule, so I had to learn to do everything perfectly.

I learned to dance a dance the way that it was meant to be danced.

And until I learned to dance that dance perfectly, I would never dance that dance.

(shouts)

And then exactly 364 days later...

♪ Do The Hustle! ♪
♪ Do the Hustle... ♪

Boy: Sock it, man!

(audience clamoring)

Girl: Go!

(cheering)

Boy: Whoa!

No complaints here, fatty.

No complaints.

Let me ask you a question about this mean kid at the talent show... was he a child emperor?

No, he was as poor and trashy as they come.

So he had no power over you then or now.

Schmidt, you got to stop letting childish ridicule dictate your actions.

Oh, yeah, well, your-your smelly butt looks dumb in those pants.

(cell phone rings)

Hello?

Winston, I need you to run a name through the system.

That's a real thing, right?

Male officer: Yeah, nice vest!

(whistling)

Hey, look, Bishop altered his uniform again.

(laughter)

Poor guy.

It's a bloodbath.

He'll live. Come here, come here, come here.

Come here!

So, here's my plan.

I knock on Reagan's door and the moment before she says good-bye, I give her the Goosebumps Walkaway of your choosing, and then I walk away.

What direction?

What direction? Do I, uh...?

Do you go left, right or backwards?

Left, le... uh, left!

Nick.

Uh, right, right.

Backwards.

Left is a great choice.

'Cause that's what I started with.

Left is a great choice.

Thank you, man.

That's, that was my instinct, left.

And I would read that one.

That's 'cause this is a perfect one.

When are you gonna tell him how you feel?

Never. I'm still leaving.

What would be the point of telling him how I feel when nothing can possibly come from it?

Winston: So... there are 28 guys named Gary Garcia.

Great, I can do that.

That's not bad. - Really?

On that piece of paper.

931 in the system; still printing.

Are you sure that Gary didn't have something distinctive about him?

Just a smile big and wide, like the door of a haunted house.

Boy, was I wrong. Gary Garcia.

In my mind, he was Lawrence from Torrance.

In your wildest fantasies, he lives in Torrance?

Lawrence from Torrance, not Lawrence of Torrance.

He was born in Torrance, but now he lives in Brentwood.

Lawrence of Brentwood.

Kind of sounds like the sponsor at the end of a game show.

Yeah. "Pat Sajak's wardrobe furnished by Lawrence of Brentwood."

Yeah.

(giggles)

This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.

Even if nothing comes of it.

So you won't end up like me.

I never told Gary how I feel, and now I never can.

You can, and you should.

Don't let Miller become your Garcia.

Hi, Nick.

I want to say something to you before we say good-bye.

Shh...

Ew.

Sayonara, Sammy.

Sayonara.

What?

That's the shower.

(whispering): I know it is.

Hello and good morning.

Hello and good morning.

You okay?

It's not so bad if I don't think about the trial.

Trial, trial, trial, trial...

♪

Hello and good morning!

Today, more on that trial that's been captivating Los Angeles.

Joining us is the trial's foreman.

Thank you for being here, ma'am.

(distorted voice): Thank you for having me, Alan; I'm a big fan.

Alan: Also with us, via satellite, is another member of the jury.

No way it's him!

Winston: Whoa...

What are the odds?

Well, exactly one in 11, Nick.

Juror...

(distorted voice): Please, please, oh, my God, please.

...237B.

(distorted shriek)

Oh! - Oh! - Oh!

Alan: Welcome, sir.

(distorted voice): It's good to be with you, Alan.

Let's start...

Gary! Gary, it's me!

Gary!

Madam Foreman?

Is that you?

Yes! I'm Jess and I like you!

I'm Gary and I like you, too.

(laughing)

There it is!

(chuckling)

Man, they sound like Cookie Monster's parents.

How do I get in touch with you?

It's gargar...

It's G-A-R-G-A-R, like Gary with no "Y"s, twice, no spaces.

Someone get me a freakin' pen!

@historicbrentwood.info.

Oh, my God.

Wait! Did you say Brentwood?

Historicbrentwood.info.

Gary of Brentwood.

Gary of Brentwood.

Gary of Brentwood.

Gary of Brentwood.

"J" as in Jack, "D" as in dog...

Should she be giving out her personal information on TV? I mean...

Jess: ...at...

...verdicts get appealed.

And K*llers go free.

Eh, hard to be k*lled over e-mail.

...and I live at 310 Traction Avenue, apartment 4D.

Easy to be k*lled in your home.

You know where to find me!

I need to see you now!

Okay, I know exactly where to go.

Stay tuned for your eight-day forecast with Crispin Saint Chang.

Jess did it right.

She said something real.

And I said "Sayonara, Sammy."

Who the hell is Sammy?

All right, man.

I'm gonna take off.

I gotta head to the station before my dance gathering.

You can't go to the station like that. They'll make fun of you.

When are you gonna stop worrying about what people say?

When I look into my suggestion box, it is full.

(laughs)

People have a lot to say about the way I live my life.

But there is only one comment card that I pay attention to.

And you know what that card says?

It says, "Great job.

Keep it up."

And you know who filled out that card?

Me.

You know how I know?

Because I recognize my motherfreakin' handwriting.

Now that's a Goosebumps Walkaway.

I can do this.

Right?

Yes, I can do this.

(phone buzzing)

Oh, what...

Hey, I was just about to call you.

Nick, look, there's something that I wish I would've said to you last night, but I didn't, so I'm gonna say it right now.

Sayonara, Sammy.

Those are such beautiful words.

I'm Sammy.

(clears throat)

Hello?

Reagan...

I'm gonna need some time to process everything you just said.

Yeah.

I really put myself out there.

Yeah.

I... Hey... in light of recent events, I think it's important that we have each other's current information.

I mean, I know I have your phone number because I just dialed it and I have your address because I lived there.

'Cause Jess said it on TV.

I've got a flight to catch.

Me, too.

Bye, Nick.

(laughs)

(sighs)

We did it.

(wry laugh)

Thank God.

Yeah.

Need some sleep.

Good night, buddy.

So, we're totally free to talk about anything.

Totally.

Yeah.

Like, any... thing.

Any thing at all.

Yes.

Gah! What are you doing here?

Well, it's been six weeks since we've talked and I was ready to talk.

You and Gary looked great on television.

(sighs) Well, that's how I want you to remember us: Blurry and talking like Zuul.

Well, then, mission accomplished?

(chuckles)

Hey, did Reagan say anything to you?

Yeah, she actually did.

She said, uh, "Sayonara, Sammy."

Does that mean anything?

No, but whatever it means will factor heavily into tonight's Nick-on-Nick time.

I don't want to know what Nick-on-Nick time is.

Masturbating.

Way more information than I wanted.

Everybody does it three or four times a day.

(laughing): Three or four times...

I'm talking about masturbating.

(laughing)

But never am I fully into it physically.

What? (giggling)

I missed you, kid.

Missed you, too.

God, your nose hairs have gone totally bananas.

I'm gonna get my scissors.

Schmidt: Cece,

I'd like to show you something that I have not been working on.

Reporter: A record heat wave is melting Los Angeles, sparking chaos in stores across the Southland. Riot police have been summoned to several locations...

Oh, damn.

This heat is untenable.

It's like a Jewfro apocalypse in here.

I look like a '70s divorce attorney.

Nick: So we don't have A/C.

You guys are going to love this.

I invented something even better.

It's called the Ranch System.

The Ranch System for Cooling.

This is one of my best inventions.

Reagan's going to freak out when she sees it.

Check it out. We've got a combination of cool winds, a-a cool, chilly pond, you wear white jeans 'cause they don't absorb heat... that's actually science, I did research.

You know, science aside, man, you working those jeans. Oh, thanks for saying that, man.

I was insecure about the way they looked.

You k*lling it, man.

Hey, guys. How are you doing?

Well, everything here looks normal.

Welcome to The Ranch.

I don't know what that means.

Have a seat.

Reagan: Why would I do that?

Nick: It'll cool you right off. You'll love it.

Ooh. Is that chair supposed to be wet?

It is.

I...

Okay.

And away we... cool!

(laughing): Check it out!

Feels like somebody is learning to whistle very close to my face.

That's right, it does.

She said it feels like someone's whistling close to her face!

I never thought of that.

It's another plus.

No.

No, it's not.

But I have a better idea.

Why don't we all cool off... with the brand-new air conditioner that I bought?

Son of a...

Yes!

What?

What?

A/C!

Oh...

Damn.

Cece: Oh, it was so hot.

Oh, yeah, this is wet.

Cece: Having A/C.

That's sweat from my bottom.

♪

Schmidt: This is amazing.

Thank you, Reagan. Finally, we can stop living like people in a beer commercial before the beer shows up.

How did you pull this off?

It's not a big deal. That whole riot thing's really overblown.

Get the hell back!

(screams)

I will be putting the A/C in my room and everyone is welcome.

No, thank you. We're good.

I speak for all of us.

Reagan: Okay.

Well, we are observing gym rules, so make sure you wipe down anything you plan to sit on.

Whatever.

More breeze for us.

I'm gonna grab some old underpants and I'll put a pair in the freezer for each of you.

Trust me, I'm wearing frozen underwear right now, and I feel amazing.

(crackling)

So, I'm in good shape.

Cece?

Mmm.

I think maybe you should go... go hang out by the A/C.

Cece's got a big audition today to be a reporter.

She's been taking broadcasting classes.

Any way you slice it, that cafeteria pizza is a great deal.

You know, in fact, I'm getting a little hungry myself.

How about you, Carl?

I thought the next thing I was supposed to talk about was the rain.

It is, Carl.

I was just having a little banter.

Oh.

Um...

I... uh, I had a sandwich so... I'm full.

The audition's just for gas station TV, okay?

Nobody watches it.

Winston: Don't you dare downplay it.

I adore gas station television, I mean, myself, personally.

It is the intersection between information and also gas.

That's right. Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news... the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.

I just, I don't...

I-I don't think I'm gonna go to the audition.

'Cause it's... it's just so hot.

You know?

Okay.

Um...

Yeah, I mean, that's-that's cool.

Just... Look, I love you no matter what.

Go cool off.

All right.

All right.

Can I talk to you for a second?

What the hell was all that coddling?

Whoa.

What are you, a big-bosomed grandma?

Tough love! Make her go!

Don't tell me what to do!

I'm her fiancé, not some schnook off the street eating a peanut butter cookie.

It's my job to give her love and support.

That's how I get her to go to the audition.

As a cop, do you think I would get anyone to do anything if I were being kind and supportive?

Hell no!

Look, I have recently found my cop voice and I'll tell you this: it is very effective.

Is that what you've been practicing in the bathroom?

(loud): Everybody stop!

Make a left turn!

(high, wavering): You have the right to remain silent! You...

(elegant): Freeze! Nah.

(over-enunciating): Three hundred and three thousand thelonious thistles...

(climbing vocal scale): ♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs ♪
♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs. ♪

(deep): Freeze! (normal): Ooh, ooh.

(A la Arnold Schwarzenegger): Down on the ground, fugitive of the law.

♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs ♪
♪ Handcuffs, handcuffs.

Those were just my warmups.

My point is this, man.

You can't hug and kiss Cece into doing anything.

Your mind would melt if you knew what I've hugged and kissed Cece into doing.

Stay out of it, Winston.

(chuckles): My guys.

Hey, who needs Reagan's A/C, right?

Here.

Put some of my old underwear on your face. It feels great.

Oh, Nick... you're gonna make a great dad.

I'll see you later.

Okay.

Hey! Who needs him, huh?

Yeah. We got each other.

Yeah.

We've been through worse.

Chicago!

Chicago!

(chuckles)

City of soup, you know?

Yes, sir.

So I'm gonna go take a shower.

I'll be back in a hot minute.

Or, as we say on a day like today...

... a minute.

(laughs) That's great, man.

That's chill, that's chill.

That's great. Thanks for taking my back today.

I'll see you in a sec.

All right, all right.

You and me, all day. You and me.

Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

Look who it is! What happened?

The A/C fall over and squish Winston's cat?

Oh, my God, please don't tell me that happened. I would die.

I just came out here to tell you that it's actually really nice in there.

It's really nice right here, with my underpants on my face.

I think maybe you should stop pouting because I didn't like whatever this is.

Wait, what?

Why would I care if you, specifically, didn't like it?

Nick.

Reagan.

Nick, come on.

You want to go there?

I want to go where?

What are you talking about?

You wanted to impress me because you have a crush on me.

(laughs)

It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.

(laughing)

I need a laugh.

It's too hot not to laugh.

Lord knows it!

You do.

(laughing)

I don't have a crush on you.

You're very conceited.

And I don't mean to burst your bubble here, missy, but I am not out here because of my "so-called crush on you, "based on my actions that led you to believe I have a crush on you."

I am out here because I have never been more comfortable in my entire life.

Okay, you know what? Just go get!

Winston and I don't need you, sister.

Reagan: Oh, you mean Winston, like, this Winston?

What do you mean, like this...

Oh, Winston.

I'm really sorry.

It's fine, it's fine. Who needs you?

'Cause the hottest part of the day is already over.

It's 9:30 in the morning.

Then tell me this: why did I just eat lunch?

Why did I just eat lunch?

(thudding) Oh, damn. Good Samaritan just collapsed.

Oh!

And UPS guy to the rescue!

(thudding) And the UPS guy just collapsed.

Ah, lady stealing packages...

Ah...

(thudding) Oh! And the lady just collapsed.

Whoo. You know, I'm actually kind of getting chilly in here.

Look, guys.

I got this box of Jess's weird old ski clothes.

Oh!

Ooh...

Hello, 1989.

Winston: Check me out, I'm Picabo Street.

You know who that is, right?

I don't know who that is.

Real après-ski vibe.

I feel like I'm in Gstaad.

Gstaad's all about après-ski.

Well, it's nice in the summer, too.

Oh, have you been?

Have you?

Have you?

Have you been, is the real question.

Have-have you been to Gstaad?

Wh... I...

What does it matter? Just tell the truth.

Have you been there? Have you been there?

I'm sorry, have you?

No, I haven't been there.

Well... (laughs)

Should I be ashamed of that, or can we all just tell the truth about whether we've been to... "Shtaad."

Please. It's "Gstaad."

Shaad.

Shtaad.

No one in this room has been to Gstaad.

Yeah, one more fan.

Just a little closer.

Okay, that'll do it.

You guys are suckers in there! This is great!

Should we be worried about him?

Worried about Nick? Oh, no, this is just what he does.

Okay, but being exposed to the heat for that long is actually super-dangerous, so... maybe I should go reason with him.

(others laughing)

"Reason."

Please excuse our immediate but correct response.

(Nick grunts)

(grunts)

Oh, hey, hey.

Please just come into my room? It's right there.

It's not even hot in reality.

You're obviously suffering from heat exhaustion.

It's like a crisp Vermont November.

Apple cider, football weather.

Don't jump in a pile of leaves.

(chuckling): There might be a d*ad dog in there.

You're slurring your speech.

Soon you're gonna get dizzy, you're gonna get cramps.

Why do you care so much, Reagan?

Because you look like a dying man on a hospital show.

Oh, I know why.

Because you have a crush on me.

No.

(laughs) Yeah.

That's... that...

I... You're... you're a human being and I'm worried about... You have a crush on me.

No. That's why you're always thinking about me...

That has nothing to do with that.

... giving me my medicals, checking on me, giving me my medicals...

You said that twice. You are hallucinating.

No, Reagan, I'm "ha-truth-inating."

Okay, you know what, I'm gonna have to smoke you out.

Ooh-hoo! Smoke me out?

Turn 'em all on, great.

I love it hot.

Nick: Great, turn 'em up.

I got the sticks if you got the melons.

Marsh-melons.

Marshmallows.

Sorry.


♪

(imitates whooshing)

(laughing): Hey, Deborah.

Hey, Cece, now that... now that we're...

What?

Now that we're in the cool, have you rethought the audition?

Maybe you'll go now?

I mean, either way I love you, I just...

Um, no.

No, okay.

Mm-mm.

Okay, I still love you though.

(whispering): You leave me with no choice.

(whispering): What are you doing?

Ma'am! I'm gonna ask that you please remove your headphones now!

What?

Do you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?

Why are you talking so loud?

Do you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again?

Winston found his cop voice.

Oh...

Ma'am! Why are you avoiding an audition when you know damn well it's important to you?

Don't do this. Get back in your vehicle, immediately!

Ma'am, please answer the question.

Why are you avoiding an audition?

And do not say that you are not, because I know that you are, so tell me why!

Why?! Why?!

Why?!

Now, damn it, speak!

What if I'm not good enough?

It's my dream job, and what if I can't do it, okay?

What?

Cece, you're the most talented...

Sir, stand down!

Winston, you stand down.

Go play softball against the f*re department or whatever it is you do.

That's not till Wednesday.

Honey, I was terrified.

Don't worry... don't...

My hands are shaking. Block that out.

I'm freaking out. Yeah.

Block that out.

Schmidt: Okay, let's plan a trip.

Something to look forward to.

Yeah, that'd be great.

Mother freckles.

Winston's wild.

Cece: God, that was so scary.

It was so terrible.

It's okay.

(grunting)

Can you just admit that it's hot in here?

There's no way that you are not hot. I'm hot.

Why are you so worried about old Nicky pots and pans?

I don't have a crush on you.

You have a crush on me, it's obvious.

Why would I have a crush on you?

You are the most stubborn, annoying, frustrating person I have ever met in my entire life.

Why don't you tell that to the judge in your pants?

Verdict's in. You're guilty.

Where are you going?!

I'm shutting down your ranch.

Leave my ranch out of it!

Well, then I'm gonna do this, you idiot.

Whoa.

No, don't.

Leave it alone.

Reagan: Stop.

Reagan: No, you don't...

(beeping) (beeping)

What is going on?!

Damn! Damn!

Reagan, please, let...

Look, she's the one...

Wh... No, you're the one.

Schmidt: Now, get down to the basement and fix our power.

But the basement? There are so many rats.

She'll probably try to make out with me.

Please, I would rather make out with a rat.

Gross. Did you hear what she just said?

Stop! Go to the basement and stay there until the power is fixed!

Yes, sir.

(bell dinging)

Now, I have accidentally pressed all of the buttons, but you will stay on the elevator until you get to the basement!

And when you get to that basement... Aw, damn...

How is it even hotter down here Because the heat stays low, you dummy.

It's bad enough that we're down here, I can't explain science to you.

I hope that the Chicago Cubs win the World Series while you're in a coma.

That's one of the meanest things anybody has ever said to me.

We are visitors, let's act like it.

Hello, rats?

Hello?! (grunts)

I come to hurt ya.

Okay, for those who have not been scared off, I actually come in peace.

My name is Nick.

I've been down here a lot.

(high-pitched): Hello, Nicholas.

I'm Jeremiah.

Sorry.

Why would you... ?

It's funny.

Very clever.

You got really scared.

I'm not so scared, but don't ever do that again.

It's also a very good rat voice.

Thank you But it is a terrible rat name.

Jeremiah? That would never be the name of a rat.

It's name is, like, Sushi.

Or "Ma-cushi."

Now, follow me.

I want to leave one set of footprints.

That is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.

♪

Oh, hello, old friend.

Funny seeing you here.

Tick-tock.

Almost audition time.

Hey, Cece.

Huh?

You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?

You didn't mean that, right?

(laughing): Yeah, I did.

Newscasters are amazing.

But so are you.

Come on, Schmidt, okay?

I'm a bartender and a model.

(Southern accent): Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.

(quietly): Yes, do it, baby.

"Vehicle"? What vehicle?

The metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back.

Oh.

Don't explain yourself. Just go with it.

You are a brilliant, amazing woman, who is capable of anything.

Okay, maybe drop the Southern accent.

(New York accent): What, you got mozzarell in your ears?

You're, uh, get out of your own way, lady, huh?

Uh, tr-try, Law & Order... uh, Hargitay.

I've got a past and it affects my job.

And my relationships... I can't really do a Mariska.

What is happening here?

Cece, I know the audition is scary for you.

I would not be doing my job as the man who loves you if I let you walk away from this.

Don't blow it, Cece!

You are not walking away from this opportunity!

Okay...

I'm gonna need less talking out of you and more action, damn it!

(quietly): Wow.

Wait, no, Cece, I'm sorry.

Did I take it too far?

(door opens)

I took it too far, didn't I? Oh, God.

It's fine.

I have been down this road many a-times.

She's gonna come walking back through that door in three, two...

(chuckles)

Look, Schmidt, not for nothing, man, you got so many good characters inside of you.

(chuckles): Oh, my gosh.

Did you already bind the 120s?

Yeah, this should do it.

Do what? (scoffs) Cook you like barbecue chicken?

I traced it back. It's fine.

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

It's not safe.

Can you admit that I might actually be right about something for once?

It's your own funeral; you win.

Great.

Don't do it!

Nick!

Fine, let's just say you are right.

Then at least let me do it, okay?

You don't have to do that.

I want to do it.

I mean, I don't, like, want to do it, obviously, but... 

(stammers) What if I'm wrong?

If you think this is right, it's probably right.

You've been, you've been right about a lot of stuff today.

Like what? What else was I right about?

Just a lot of stuff. I don't want to talk about what you were actually right about at this moment. Okay, ready?

Uh...

If I get b*rned up and die this way, it would be such an embarrassing way to go.

But what would be nice about it is that I would technically have been right.

Here we go.

Heroes don't wear capes.

No, no, no...

(whirring)

Those sons of bitches did it.

(chuckling)

Hey, great!

Really good.

That was really great.

Huge... rat.

(squeaking)

(screaming)

(screaming) No! No! No!

This is my nightmare!

(people shouting indistinctly)

It's time.

(grunting)

How did I... ?

Did you carry me out like a firefighter?

No, you woke up right away.

And then you were like, "Ooh, I need some fresh air."

So we came outside, I bought you a muffin and then you passed out again.

Oh, yeah, I remember that muffin.

I feel like you had a pretty bad shock, so let's ask a few questions.

What day of the week is it?

That's not something I typically know.

I would guess Monday.

Okay.

Blackout.

ATM's are down.

Cash is king and batteries is queen.

What? Stop being so whimsical, Winston.

Cece still hasn't called me back.

(sighs)

I think I pushed her too far.

No, Schmidt, you did the right thing, man.

Look, people get mad at police officers because we tell them what they don't want to hear.

Yet, everyone loves police officer...

(horns honking)

(deep voice): Hey, it's a blackout, not the Rapture!

You yield!

All right!

(people shouting)

Hey, hey, hey, sir, sir!

Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

Come on, right this way, ma'am.

Right this way, ma'am. Right this way, ma'am.

Right that way, ma'am. Sir, go, go, go!

We ain't got all day!

Winston: Sir!

Cece.

Right this way, ma'am. Right that way, ma'am.

Thank God you're here.

Look... I'm-I'm sorry.

Yeah, well, you should be. You really pissed me off.

I wrote something rude on your car.

It was that stupid cop voice.

I shouldn't have pushed you that hard.

No, you should've.

'Cause you were right.

I was chickening out.

So I went.

You did?

Mm-hmm.

Well, that's amazing. How did it go?

Real bad. Yeah.

It went real bad?

Okay, well, you know what? about it, baby, I'm sure...

No, no, no, no. They just didn't...

It was, it was legitimately terrible but not because I'm not talented.

I went to the bar first so I was wasted and wearing shorts, which I won't do next time.

(both laugh)

Thank you for pushing me.

We need to do that kind of thing for each other.

Yes, please.

I agree, unless, of course, it's about me using face wash all over my body.

Ah, this again, really?

I don't care that it's expensive.

I know that you don't care.

I'm just gonna keep on doing it.

(music playing)

Oh, ice cream truck! Oh!

Right this way!

Here we go, sir. Here we go, sir.

Here we go, sir. All right, stop!

(music playing)

Ice cream, man, open up.

Where the ice cream at?

Can I buy you some ice cream?

First, uh, I just want to revisit that little moment in the basement where you were like, "Hey, Reagan, you've been right about a lot of stuff today."

Really?

I just want you to specifically tell me what You are out of control. I've been right about.

You're a grown man. I just think you should be able to say it.

(laughs) You dick.

I have a crush on you.

Hmm.

There it is.

I have a crush on you.

Isn't that better?

Now we can just put it behind us, move on, don't have to be weird.

No, I, obviously, I-I know it's not gonna be a problem, Reagan.

I don't have any illusion that you're gonna go for a guy like me.

I am a total mess. I understand that.

I mean, you're-you're beautiful, and-and you're smart, and you're-you're mean, but in a hot way.

And-and you have the-the mind of a electrician, which is so confusingly hot, because that is not, like, a sexy...

Well, that one diner has the best bacon.

Great bacon.

So I don't know.

Ugh, come on, guys. Please, God, we're entering minute 20 of the great brunch debate.

The other diner does have that special fruit cup.

Other diner. Fruit cup. Let's go.

However, when I think about it, huge crowd looking for that special fruit cup.

Smart.

So now we got to think line versus bacon.

Please, I am starving.

Make a decision. Oh, hi.

Do you guys want to join us? We are going for brunch in seven days.

Hybrid meals are for people who are too lazy to wake up for a proper breakfast.

Besides, we're looking for a wedding venue today.

Good luck with these two, because if they get really hungry, then all bets are off.

Curveball... maybe we roast a turkey.

Have either of you ever made a decision in your lives?

I make decisions all the time.

Disrespectful.

What's the last decision that you made?

First of all, you got to make a decision if you gonna make a decision.

You know what I mean?

(whistles, mimics expl*si*n)

Of course we make decisions. How do you think I'm wearing clothes right now?

I laid those out for you, Nick.

But I decided to let you.

This is your whole problem. Imagine how much better your life would be if you could just make a decision.

She's just mad because she had a bunch of dumb brunch ideas, you damn fool. (laughs)

(laughs)

Okay. Uh, well, what about this? I will sleep with one of you tonight if you can just decide who.

Are you... are you serious?

I mean, we're talking about a one-time thing and you can't get weird afterwards, but, yeah, I'm... down for, like, a fun half hour.

And you would be there?

Yes.

You would physically be there?

Yes.

Can it... be nice?

Well, that's on you. Let me know by 9:00.

What if we die before then?

There's not much I can do about that.

Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves. I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, am I right?

No, they don't. To the sausage factory.

What?

That's not what I meant.

Yeah. Let's go.

All right.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Good luck with your decision.

(door closes)

At what cost?

One sexual barracuda to another, I see what you're doing.

You're doing it for the story.

You want to see how deep the abyss goes.

You want to look that monster straight into the eye.

Maybe it's so bad that it's good.

But it's not good. It's b... it's bad.

Cece: Okay, honey, calm down.

She's not actually gonna do it.

No, I'm trying to teach them a lesson.

This isn't an '80s summer camp movie.

I'm not gonna sleep with somebody based on a bet.

I'm just... I was just kind of playing along with the whole thing just in case they were listening at the door.

Something about "summer camp moogie."

"Summer camp moogie."

No, no, no. I got nothing.

This isn't real, right?

It can't be. (laughs)

I mean...

I mean, it can't be.

Why would it be?

But on the off chance that it is, we need to take this extremely seriously.

You're absolutely right. Okay, okay. Well, what do you suggest?

(sputters) We do a gentlemen's debate.

A gentlemen's debate.

We calmly discuss who merits this opportunity and we come to a decision based off respect and politeness.

I agree. So... please proceed, sir.

Thank you, sir.

You're welcome, sir.

(chuckling)

Okay.

The gentleman knows that I have a monster crush on Reagan.

But because this is such a powerful argument in my favor, I politely take it off the table.

In that case, the gentleman politely... thanks you.

Hmm. The gentleman was sure that the other gentleman would not be such a jerk and let his friend's dreams come true.

Perhaps I'm not dealing with a gentleman at all.

Perhaps I'm dealing with a dingus.

Did you call me a dingus?

You're acting like a dingus.

How can I be a dingus when you're the damn dingus?

You're the dingus. You're the d...

You're-you're... you are...

Oh. Hey. - Hey.

Looking forward to sex later.

Well, that makesthree of...

That makes two of us.

Well, get ready for the skin circus, you little peanut.

Okay.

Whoa.

I was put in an awkward situation, and I reacted poorly.

Oh, whoa.

Everything rides on this decision.

You know, the venue is the axle of the wedding chariot.

I know that you have dreamed about this day since you were a little boy, but we are paying for this out of our own pocket, okay? So we cannot get carried away.

Okay.

Man: Yeah.

Man: Oh, I see...

Okay, this could work.

(instrument crackling)

(crackling continues)

Yeah... Huh?

(grunts)

Oh, my God. No.

Oh!

Some tea lights and flowers and this place could be nice.

It's like a Mumford & Sons music video, yeah?

Is there hay in here?

We're looking for the vacant warehouse for the wedding venue?

Vacant warehouse?

They're closing us down.

We're all getting fired.

Grab what you can!

Hey, you guys, kind of not cool.

You were supposed to text me before you got here. Okay.

Can everyone just take a seat, please?

Can you just stop t...

I thought you said feelings were off the table.

Well, I'm putting 'em back on the table.

I'm gonna settle this right here, right now.

Do it.

Cindy...

No.

...De La Garza.

Oh.

Huh, so look at me.

Look at me. Let it affect you.

You knew I had a crush on Cindy De La Garza,

and you Frenched her anyway.

(gasps)

Frenching! They're Frenching! They're Fren...

Chaperone!

They're Frenching! (shouts)

I had dibs on her since the fifth grade, dude!

If I could un-French her, I would.

You owe me this.

I knew that French was gonna haunt me.

You called dibs... and I screwed up.

What you gonna say? What you gonna say?

It's you.

Oh, yes. Man, that girl better get ready for some kind, attentive lovemaking. Oh.

Hey, uh, have you guys seen my purple sweater?

Uh, no. And, by the way, we've made our decision.

Wow. That was fast. You have until 9:00.

We don't need it.

You'll be having Winston.

That's me. I'm Winston.

Great. Don't eat for two hours before. I'm really looking forward to it.

Bring your A-game, okay? Any previous injuries that I need to know about? Bring something to numb your mouth.

Oh. Look.

The sweater was in my hand the whole time.

You know, this woman requested my A-game.

My A-game. Maybe it's hopeless that I could even please this woman sexually. What am I thinking, Winston?

Just focus on yourself. Concentrate on yourself sexually, Winston.

No, Winston, that is not your way.

I just want to head off any discussion of what your way is.

I'm so sorry. I'm just feeling a little insecure about my body and the way it is connected to my face.

Bishop... (sighs) you have nothing to worry about.

Really?

Yeah.

Okay. What's my best feature?

Instant regret. Instant.

The second I said it, I was like...

If you had to pick.

Fine.

You have very nice...

That's our suspect. He's taking off!

What?

Okay.

(siren wailing)

Okay, I'll let you take point on this one, because I got to protect my duke for later.

Oh, you suck so much.

Has that park always been a pet cemetery or were just crazy people burying a dog there?

Well, I'm not even close to giving up.

Why don't we just pop in here?

Oh, really? We just "happened" upon The Lisbon, Schmidt?

Purely a coincidence that we... made it just on time for the appointment that I made a month ago.

Why are you doing this to yourself?

(classical music playing)

Ah. Mr. Schmidt.

May I offer you a beverage?

Perhaps an organic cucumber vodka spritzer?

Yes.

It is so beautiful. I feel like I'm inside Cate Blanchett.

We get that a lot.

I've got to say, I'm pretty impressed with how quickly you guys came to that decision.

Well, that's 'cause you don't know how mature we are.

You see, Winston had dibs on Cindy De La Garza since the fifth grade, I Frenched her in the eighth grade, so...

So about 20 years ago Winston had a three-year-old dib, he never acted on it, and now you're the bad guy?

(laughs): Oh, Reagan.

First of all, dibs can't be singular...

I mean, if anything, it's kind of a story about how indecisive Winston can be.

Well, no, it's a story about...

But you guys came to a decision... I'm proud of you.

Uh, can I... can I practice my presentation on you?

Sure. But I'm bored already.

Okay.

This stuff's really boring for me.

For everybody, I guess.

Hmm.

Hepatitis C can be a long... arduous experience.

But now discover Zilpoza from Wudai Pharmaceuticals.

FDA approval... pending double-blind study.

If you've had cirrhosis or kidney disease, Zilpoza... may not... be right...

(whispers): for... you.

(laughing)

You think I'm a 13-year-old boy?

I know what you're doing.

What am... what am I doing?

You're trying to lead me on, and I won't have it.

Case closed! You're having Winston!

Great, I'm having Winston.

Uh...

Mm.

(exhales)

It's so juvenile, what you're doing.

A dib is a dib.

Oh, God, if I keep looking at the ceiling, I'm gonna cry.

Damn it, we are getting sucked in... we have to leave immediately.

It's probably not even available.

There's no way, right? I mean...

You're right.

(chuckles) Philip.

Hmm? Quick question.

Look, we realize that you guys book up decades in advance, so please just let us know that you don't have any slots available.

Actually, you're in luck... Shia LaBeouf had to cancel his solitaire tournament, and we have one open slot, in April.

(quiet groan)

In April?

Mm-hmm.

All right, babe, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

You need to breathe. We're just gonna enact the plan that we set up for when you see an ankle boot you really, really, really like, right?

What do we do? We walk away...

And if I dream about it in the middle of the night, then it's meant to be.

We're gonna walk away, Philip.

Thank you so much for all your help.

I should let you know, however, there is another interested party.

Benjamin (laughs): What? Schmittyballs?

B... B-Benjamin.

Okay.

Schmidt: You're engaged?

Hmm.

Mazel to you, sir.

Hey, Meems, this is the, uh, fat guy from school we used to make dance for chocolate.

Mimi: Oh.

Schmidt: In all fairness, uh, Benjamin would peg chocolate at my head while I was already dancing.

He what?

Benny-boo, I don't want to lose The Lisbon to these fat people.

The hell?

Don't worry, Schmidtstain can't afford The Lisbon.

Oh.

Unless, of course, they accept gift certificates from fat camp.

Benjamin, I still... I mean... I can...

Do they do that? I'm a different...

We'll have to ask somebody about that.

Okay, that is it!

We... are booking The Lisbon.

We are?

Go!

No.


I've never loved you more, Cece!

What were you gonna say?

What is that in reference to?

It's been silent for 30 minutes.

Earlier, you were gonna tell me what my best feature was, and then we got distracted.

Right. By crime.

I could tell you what yours is.

Oh, my God, please don't.

You have a lovely neck.

Really?

Not my knuckles or, like, the skin behind my ears?

Okay, do me. It's my turn.

Come on, come on, come on, come on, I need this.

Fine.

I will tell you, but then we drop it immediately and forever.

Drop.

You have kind eyes.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

I have kind eyes.

I'll take that.

You know, I always thought I had snail eyes.

"Immediately and forever," remember?

I'll turn around.

Turn around.

I-I'll save my kind eyes for last.

Okay.

(phone buzzing)

Hello?

I'm reopening the Reagan decision.

Wait, what?

(quietly): I already took my supplements.

I know. I'm sorry. I'm telling her we've decided, and it was me.

Oh, no, you are not! I hear shaving.

Are you shaving?

No!

I know what that means.

(phone beeps) Hello? Hello, Nick?

(whispers): Damn.

Just go.

You mean it?

Thank you very much, Aly.

I am going to win this sex bet!

We want to get married at The Lisbon.

We want to book The Lisbon right now!

Uh, start by filling these forms out.

It'll be pleasure.

Yeah, no problem.

Cece: What's our routing number?

69364278.

Just gonna give Benjamin a little coffee... oh, I'm so sorry.

Hey, come on, she can't do that.

No, no, she did that. I'm so sorry.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

The service is so gorgeous.

Really great.

You do realize we're not gonna decide this on who writes the fastest.

You know, here at The Lisbon, we celebrate grandeur, romance.

Oh, you are Schmidt out of luck, Schmidt.

Our wedding's gonna be sick romantic.

Our wedding's gonna be way romantic, bro.

Quiches so small you got to wear glasses.

Bitch, we're gonna have more white linen than a hospital in the Great w*r.

Yeah, we're gonna have so many fresh cut flowers that you're gonna have a real bee problem up in this bitch.

We're gonna have spanakopita so flaky, you're gonna get crumbs all over your mouth, like, what?

Our tables are gonna be names of cities that we've been to, like, what?

Our wedding is gonna be so... big... that the Giants will come to town and everyone gets a big spoon.

Philip, you-you want romance?

Let me tell you the story about how I knew that Mimi was the one for me.

The story is called "Lovestruck."

Schmidt: There's a title?

It was our fourth date, and we had just seen Toy Story 3 for the second time.

Maybe it's just us, but we love Pixar.

Benjamin: We're nerds.

(Mimi giggles)

I reach for Mimi's hand, and I was struck by lightning.

I mean, literally, I was struck Yeah. Zap. by a bolt of lightning, Philip, and I... I would've been k*lled if Mimi hadn't grounded me.

We met... crying (chuckles) over the same name at the Vietnam Memorial.

George...

Harrison...

Ford.

Wha...?

Who was our grandfather.

Schmidt: What? Making us cousins?

Making us cousins, because there is nothing more romantic than forbidden love.

Between family members? I mean, that's...

You're gonna double down with that?

Yes, I am.

He's writing "cousins" down.

Cece: That's a positive thing.

No, it's not.

Hey. What are you doing, man?

We had a decision.

The decision wasn't valid... your dib on Cindy was expired.

Okay, first of all dibs don't expire.

Also, dibs... not singular.

And how are you still shaving?

I'm doing full body, Winston.

I started from the bottom, now I'm here.

That's gross.

I've been doing sex prep all day.

I did a hundred girl push-ups.

I washed my feet until the water ran clear.

You can clean your feet all damn day... it don't matter, because I'm having sex with Reagan tonight.

The decision's been made.

Well, the decision's been changed... I'm having sex with Reagan.

That's not gonna happen.

It is gonna happen.

Now, if you'll excuse me...

No, don't...

Got it!

What were you going for?

The cologne.

I smell so pretty!

Give me... give me my col...

(grunts) No. No, no, no. No.

(spitting)

Oh, God! Aah!

(grunts) What are you doing!

I don't know, man!

You got frickin' cologne all over me.

I smell fantastic!

Oh, my God.

We got to turn the tables on Reagan, make her decide.

I don't see her going for it, man... the entire point was that we had to make a decision.

Well, then I guess we're gonna have to trick her, and I know how.

We'll up your fee by $10,000.

Ten thousand and one dollar!

Uh, Cece, we don't have $10,000. We barely have the one.

Ten thousand and two dollars!

It's not your turn to bid.

$15,000!

$15,000...

It's not... it's not... it's not worth it.

It's not worth it. Yeah, but it's your dream.

I... I know.

But I already have my dream.

It's marrying you.

It's all yours, Benjamin.

Yes! (giggles)

Benjamin: "I have my dream."

Dumb!

Mimi: They remind me of my stupid grandparents on their 60th anniversary.

(laughs) Old.

(murmuring)

Reagan.

Let me guess. You guys made a final decision?

Please. Sit.

That's probably the first time you've been right all day, but yes, we have made a decision.

Great.

Winston: Here's the deal, Reagan.

It's 2016, you're a lady.

Your decision is important to us.

Yes, we want you to decide which one of us is most attractive to you, and if that person is the same name that's on the piece of paper in this envelope, then sexual relations can commence.

Okay, well, the logic is bulletproof.

I just feel like if I'm gonna be making this decision, I need you guys to pitch yourselves.

For starters, I'm completely hairless, Okay. except for a straggler near one of my nipples, because I got scared while shaving.

In my fantasies, I'm a wild lover.

In real life, my sexual prowess has been described as "fine," "adequate."

"It'll get the job done."

That is both a lot and a little, but either way, a tough act to follow.

Winston, you're up.

Well, that's easy.

I've got kind eyes.

Nick: You don't have kind eyes.

You have snail eyes. Everybody knows that.

I've got kind eyes. Aly told me so.

Who's Aly?

Yeah, she's my partner at work. I complimented her first, told her she had a very nice neck, which she does.

But what I should have said was, "You got a really cool chin," or "You got some dope earlobes."

Honestly, everything about her is great.

And when I'm with her, I never really notice time.

It's probably because she is the best part of my day.

I should... I should have told her one of those things, as opposed to the neck thing, you know.

Then she told me I had kind eyes.

You like Aly.

Yes.

She's my partner.

Nick: Winston!

Come on, it's obvious. You like Aly.

I-I like her. I-I like Aly.

Oh, my goodness!

Why did I never think of that before?

Wow, my mouth is dry.

Anybody else's mouth dry?

What should I do? I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do. What should I do?

Winston, this is Cindy De La Garza all over again.

You need to make a decision.

I got to ask her out.

Good! Go!

Go ahead! Go! Good luck!

Listen, Reagan, I am so sorry, but obviously, we will not be making love tonight.

No. It's not fair.

I'm sorry.

I got to go.

Well, I guess that leaves just old Nick Miller.

Mm. Your room or my room?

Hmm?

Well, both rooms have a lot of interesting possibilities.

Mm-hmm.

That's a heck of a question.

Your, um...

Give me 15 minutes, and I'm gonna come back and tell you which room and why from my opinion, and then, you can give me yours, and we can discuss.

Just give me one second, and, uh, I'll be good to go.

I just need... two minutes tops.

Stay there.

(grunts)

Oh.

Oh! Aw, no!

Oh, that's a lot of blood.

Oh.

Damn.

(sighs)

Well, you're back, and you have an insane look in your eyes, so... congratulations?

No, I didn't do it.

I was, uh... You know, I thought about it.

Oh, I don't need to know.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah...

Would you like to go out after work, grab a drink with me?

Sure.

Sure. (laughs)

All right then. (laughs)

Oh. Uh, can my boyfriend come?

Your boyfriend? Yeah.

Yeah, sure! (clears throat)

How long have you guys been...?

Yeah, it's new.

It's new. It's new. It's...

He's an agent, actually, for... animal actors?

What am I gonna say? No.

He should stay at home and not exist, please.

(laughs) No, I won't say that.

Officer down... to meet your boyfriend.

I realize those were a poor choice of words for a station.

Reagan: Nick!

It's almost 9:00. Are we doing this or what?

What is that?

You look like you're in a Boca Raton street g*ng.

I didn't think you were actually gonna go through with it, and even if you were...

I made a decision.

I wouldn't want it like this.

So I decided to put on my I'm-not-having-sex tonight outfit, 'cause no one's gonna have sex with me in this outfit.

And now I'm gonna go out and have a drink.

Would you like to come?

Wow. Deciding Nick.

Let me change.

Nick: FYI... your I'm-not-having-sex-tonight outfit is leopard print and tight.

I don't know if you know that.

It's animal print, but it's not tight.

These are baggy, fuzzy PJs with a flap on the butt.

Exactly my point. You want to see what's in the envelope?

It's a blank sheet of paper.

You're so wrong.

Does that look like a blank sheet of paper?

Very clever.

Thanks, yeah. I thought of it when I was getting tickets to the World Series of Chili and had to prove that I was human.

Ooh, ooh.

We've got big news, you guys.

Champagne all around.

We're getting married in a...

Both: soon-to-be-abandoned warehouse!

Yeah. Champagne.

Oh, thank you.

And I'll even give you one.

Hey, guys, Aly is on her way to the bar.

(cheering)

With her boyfriend.

Oh, that's the worst.

Well, you know, everyone dies. Maybe he'll die.

I'm sorry, Winston.

Is there anything we can do to cheer you up?

Uh, no.

Anything that would make you feel better?

Anything?

Anything?

Well, if you insist, then.

You asked me what I wanted. This is all want.

All right, let's do it, let's do it. Let's just do it. Let's do it.

All: ♪ Motown ♪
♪ Philly's back again ♪

Now slower.

(slowly): ♪ With a little ♪
♪ East coast fling ♪

Winston: Slower...





Hey. Uh, where'd you get these burritos?

From the spot on the corner?

Mmm.

Yeah, the spot on the corner.

You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?

Ugh.

Nick: That's disgusting.

A baby in the middle of the place.

I knew that wasn't going to stop you.

Disgusting.

You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.

Baby's perfectly fine.

But let's just say I did not do a good job.

(door closes)

Winston: Oh, Reagan. What's up?

Hey. So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.

Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?

Nick (mouth full): It's a dog, not a donkey.

I know that guy. His name is...

His name is Stan.

Stan. S-T-A-N.

His dog's name's Cheerio.

Hold on.

It's not a donkey.

Um, it's a dog.

Okay.

(sighs) That was painful, Nick.

It's like watching Cece make a bed.

(Cece humming a tune)

Just give me the sheet!

I can't be normal around Reagan.

She's too hot and mysterious.

I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.

Yep. Nothing.

The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.

She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.

Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?

I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.

That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight; and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so...

(laughing): It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!

Thanks, but no, thanks.

Nick: There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom! It's...

(door opens and closes)

Are you hiding toilet paper again?

I can't do this.

Did she h*t us with a "No, thanks"?

How about this? No, thanks, to your "No, thanks."

Here's what I'm gonna do...

I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.

Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.

You have a sexual to-do list?

Cece, don't ask.

Number one...

I regret it already.

Joan Allen.

Oh! Nick!

She's back in the kitchen! She's back in the kitchen!

Nick, we're making sex.

It hasn't started yet.

It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.

It's called foreplay, you tween.

You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.

What?

The Groser Preis von Deutschland.

Just let me eat in here. I don't want to eat around Reagan.

Why not? Oh, I forgot that you're a bear in pants.

Will you please go eat in your room?

She's right across the hall. She'll hear the crunching!

We need you elsewhere, Nick.

From my cold, d*ad hands!

That doesn't even apply.

Reagan! (laughs)

Ooh, what a coincidence. We're both running!

And I've been chasing you for miles like a m*rder!

I kind of prefer to run alone.

You see?

That's your problem right there.

We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.

Ooh, look. A bubbler.

Oh. Oh.

(slurping loudly)

Oh, that's so good! Mmm.

There's a Band-Aid in there.

Woman: Reagan?

Camilla. Oh, my God. Hi.

Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?

Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta."

Well, hello. What have we here?

Back on the stick, I see.

No, no, no.

No. No. I'm just staying with him and his roommates.

Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.

You know, we only got you for a month.

I get you for a whole month?

I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.

Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)

Call you later. I will.

Do that.

Call me, yes. Okay, great.

I'm going to. Okay.

Great.

Can't wait.

What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?

I am hooking up with her. I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.

What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?

Oh, you see what we're doing right now?

We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!

Okay, now it's my turn. Let me do you.

Um... I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.

Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before. I don't know how.

I travel so much that I usually just disappear.

Wow.

Okay. I will help you break up with her.

Why? 'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?

No. Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.

Wait a minute. What makes you think I've been dumped a lot?

Please.

I read you guys the moment I got there.

Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.

Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."

And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.

You're pretty good. You're pretty good.

Schmidt: How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?

We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.

And the biscuits... are rising.

I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown on the bottom.

I'm gonna be honest.

That went right over my head. I just didn't get it.

I don't know... I don't know where you're going with it.

Plus, I can't concentrate. It's filthy in here.

How do we keep Nick out of here?! He thinks that Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.

Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.

You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.

You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.

You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.

There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.

I am a Democrat.

(laughing)

Ah, that's so funny. I love you.

Okay.

So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.

He'll spin out.

He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.

(scoffs)

Nick's a conspiracy theorist.

It's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.

Okay. So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out. Easy.

It'll be the opposite of easy.

It will be difficult.

Oh.

We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.

Reagan wears a wig.

What? Get out of here.

No, it's true.

She-she told me.

Oh, she told you?

Yeah.

When?

Before.

(scoffs)

Well, the timing definitely checks out.

The only question is why.

Personal, um, lady reasons.

I don't want to touch that.

(bl*ws through lips)

"Reagan wears a wig."

"Told you before."

Yep.

"Because of lady stuff."

Wow.

I don't buy it.

Doesn't make sense.

We failed.

Patience. I know my boy.

But, Schmidt...

I know my boy!

Hey, Nick.

Got to get busy living or get busy dying. Heard.

What are you doing?

What are you doing is the question. What are you doing?

Were you just smelling my hair?

No. I'm just Nicky being Nicky.

Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.

You like those, too? Neither?

(door opens and closes)

It's a wig.

(yelling): Doesn't make sense!

What?

(chuckles)

Ding, ding.

The biscuits are ready.

Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?

S...

I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.

I don't get that one, either. Who the hell is Cousin Andy?

I just made it up. Mmm.

Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.

Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap, Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...

I feel like we have established your credentials.

Okay. So I'm Camilla. Break up with me.

(clears throat)

(scoffs) Camilla...

Yes, baby. I love you so much.

We have had a lot of really good times together, and I just...

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!

I knew this was comin'.

Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.

What-what are you doing?

Oh, no. Are you breaking up with me? Why you hate me?

Why you hate me so much?

I don't... I don't hate you. I don't hate you.

Oh, my God, you don't? Oh, my goodness. So you're not breaking up with me.

We're gonna have such a happy life together.

I-I...

I am. I am breaking up with you.

Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.

Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?

Yo, this is mad crazy. I'm pregnant with your child.

Okay.

That isn't possible.

Yeah, his name is D'Lante.

We would never name our child that.

Yeah. D-apostrophe-Lante.

No, I can't... Look, I can't do this.

Look, I want you to be happy. Here.

Here's $80.

Wow. Really?

You're just gonna bail?

Yeah.

I suck at this, obviously.

I don't want to hurt her.

Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.

Here.

Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?

I don't... know.

I just feel like it's over.

Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.

Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston."

Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston." Or... or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house."

I have an idea.

Okay.

What if you break up with Camilla for me?

I'm sorry, what?

Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.

What? No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.

This is a very important moment in your life.

You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.

If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.

Okay, deal.

I been thinking...

Damn it, Miller!

Maybe Winston was right. How well do we know this Reagan character?

I mean, sure, she wears a wig.

Not a big deal. Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?

Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?

A bald person?

Sure. I'll say so.

They're bald. Somebody hiding something?

Definitely.

Cece: Okay, look.

Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?

Beyoncé, Beyoncé wears wigs, and you would trust Beyoncé with your life.

Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé with my life.

♪ Surfboard, surfboard ♪
♪ Bringin' on that wood, oh, baby, bringin' on that wood! ♪

We be all night.

We be all night.

Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?

'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.

She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.

Her room. That's it.

Great thinking.

That's why I love you.

That's why.

Not physically.

Uh, but as a person.

Like, um, it's not sexual. I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend. It's not sexual.


Her room!

Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh!

Jackpot.

Ribbons! Oh, these are probably Jess's.

Nick, stop. You should not be in here.

I am learning so much about you, Reagan.

An Ohio State T-shirt.

Cash from Canada. It's Canadian cash.

A picture of a little boy.

This woman is like an orange. You peel a layer, there's another layer there.

You're thinking of an onion. An orange only has one layer.

Oh, you poor thing.

Okay, someone has to put everything back exactly like they found it.

Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.

Nick, what are you doing?

I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.

Okay, I'm gonna end this. Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.

We made the whole thing up.

But I smelled it and I saw it.

We couldn't get you out of our room.

Why would you lie to me?

Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.

Talk to her? Like a normal human being?

Yes, that's exactly what I want you to do.

Yes. Mm-hmm.

I have nothing in common with that woman.

She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.

And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.

Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.

She's gonna be home soon.

Wait.

What are these?

"Sarah Nevada"? "Suzi Shimizu"?

That's Reagan's face.

These are fake I.D.'s.

Fake I.D.'s?

Schmidt: Okay.

It's f... it's fake identification.

You're damn right it is, Jack.

Okay.

Okay.

Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.

Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?

Because how much do we actually really know about her?

Who has fake I.D.'s?

I'll tell you who.

Con men. Grifters.

It's all starting to make sense to me.

Check this out. Let me break this down for you.

Okay? She and her bastard son...

Or her nephew.

...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.

Pills. Doctor. Pharmacy. Whatever she does.

To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.

Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.

Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.

(chuckles)

(door opens)

Reagan: Guys! Winston made me bring home dinner.

It's Reagan.

Or is it Suzi?

Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me? Clean up the floor!

Okay, yeah.

She is the one who has to explain herself.

Let her come in here.

You have gone full Nick, Cece.

What does that mean?

She's bought into your nonsense!

Enough. I'm very disappointed with you.

Put this down. I'll-I'll fold it.

I just picked it up!

You don't know what you're doing.

Hey, Reagan, come in here!

No, no, Reagan!

Don't come in here!

There's a possum in here!

Don't come in here, 'cause there's...

What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?

Who are you?

I'm her roommate.

Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?

Now I have no more questions.

Great. Then I'm out. Blessings.

Okay, look, um, I know this is not ideal.

But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot of work to do emotionally.

Are you really gonna let her get away with this?

You must know how this makes me feel.

You've clearly been dumped many times.

Why do people keep saying that?

You ordered a Shirley Temple.

It's a virgin Denzel.

If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.

You know what, she should have, and I told her that.

It's the least she could have done.

Hey, you're preaching to the choir.

Ask me how many times I've been dumped.

I don't have the... 47 times. And once on my birthday.

And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?

Getting bailed on.

Getting bailed on.

Why do people think they can just disappear on you?

They're not thinking at all. Except of themselves.

Let's go find her.

Hell yeah. Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it, and that's not a good idea.

Where is she?

How you... how you know I know where she at?

You said you're roommates.

Damn.

Bitten by my own snake.

So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss. Is that correct?

That's true.

Yes. - Chicago.

So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.

I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.

I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.

Who does?

Okay. All right, fine.

What about this, though... your son?

He looks just like you.

That is me.

Wait. What?

Oof. Rough haircut. Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.

(clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?

Yes, you went full Nick.

Right, yeah, I see that now.

I'm full Nick every day. Imagine how that feels.

We all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.

I'm sorry that we went through your room.

Well, that's not what I'm upset about. I mean, I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.

Excuse me?

Wait, you went through our rooms?

Oh, no.

How else am I supposed to get to know you?

But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.

I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.

I didn't assume he was building a human cage.

I'm building a tree house.

You're doing wha... you're building a tree house?

Well, why am I not involved? Why is Cece not involved?

We want to be involved.

Oh, I'm involved.

So's Winston.

What?

Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?

Forget about it. Reagan, how would you like to build a tree house with me?

No.

Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.

No. I feel like we are really off-topic here.

What I'm trying to say is: Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?

Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.

Who apparently are building a tree house together.

Not apparently. We are.

Mm-hmm.

On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.

Oh, my God. Okay, that's what this is about?

Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.

There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.

Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.

I am so upset right now.

Winston: Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.

I did not help out today.

Camilla.

Hi, baby, hi.

What are you doing here?

Cut the crap.

Why?

You sent him to dump me?

No. (scoffs) To dump you?

No. Why would I do that... Why would you do that?

Nick: What the hell, man?

Cece: That is crazy.

Why would anyone do that?

What's wrong with you?

(quietly): Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.

Reagan, are you dumping me or not?

No.

Kind of.

Look, Camilla, I, uh...

I don't want to... I don't want to hurt you.

Just say it.

Okay. (clears throat)

The truth is...

...that I'm a criminal.

What?

I'm a criminal.

You shouldn't be with me. I'm disgusting.

Things I've done.

Things I'm capable of.

Hard life, short life... I probably won't live that long.

I can't believe this.

She's a criminal.

Filthy.

Disgusting crimes.

One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.

And who are you?

I'm her, uh, co-criminal.

Co-gangster. We run the streets together.

From Bangkok to Chicago to here.

Just m*rder people.

My name is Nick. On the streets, they call me, uh...

Sharky.

Sharky, that's right.

'Cause I att*ck from beneath up.

Cece: It's all true, Camilla.

And her name is not Reagan.

It's Suzi Shimizu.

You're Japanese?

Very much so.

We happen... we happen to all be Japanese.

The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.

Unnecessary backstory.

Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh... (clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.

Isn't that right, Sharky?

You're on your own, Moyel.

And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.

I am spinning out here, Moyel. You got to help me.

Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?

Schmidt knows about the tree house?

Okay, what the hell is going on?

Winston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.

Stop it. This isn't real.

You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?

Reagan, tell me the truth.

Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.

I'll just go.

Camilla, wait.

Look...

(exhales)

This isn't working out.

But I think that it's my fault.

Because I don't let people in.

I'm sorry.

I think that you deserve a lot better than that.

Thank you.

I know that wasn't easy for you.

Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?

Yes.

Oh, no, no, no...

Uh, it's right in my room. Right here, in the first door.

Right there.

Okay, thanks.

Winston: Oh, no, no.

Nick: That's nice.

Telling the truth works.

Schmidt: Yeah, it did.

Cece: Good job.

Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.

Camilla: Freaking bitch! (crashing)

I hate you! I hate you so much!

Oh.

Yeah, it's the old "I left my sweater" trick.

(Camilla roaring)

Let me tell you something, folks, I've played that song before.

All right, well, this obviously turned out to be a huge disaster.

I hate you so much!

But... thank you.

Try sleeping on an upside down bed!

I'm proud of you.

All of you... I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.

You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.

(Camilla yells)

Anything to help.

It's kind of what we do.

It's how we roll.

(Camilla shrieks)

How do you think she's taking it?

What's with all these ribbons?!

How long do you think she's gonna be in there?

I like to do about 15.

Camilla: You are never gonna forget me!

You are never gonna forget Camilla!

So, what'd you bring us for dinner?

Cece: How about this one?

Are you ready to... soak Mama's beans?

It's working, right?

Okay, shh. I love you.

Yeah, I love you, too. I love you.

Let's not talk.

Okay.

(grunting)

Nick!

What?

You still can't eat in front of Reagan?

This has nothing to do with Reagan. I... I've just gotten used to eating in here. It's cozy.

Why, what are you guys up to?

What?

(knock at door)

Can I come in? My room is trashed.

This is where we eat, right?

Yes, please, please, please.

Might as well.

I mean, sure, why not?

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Okay!





Hey.

Hey, what can I get you?

Can I get a beer and, uh, your number?

Actually, I'm...

This woman is engaged.

Her number belongs to God now.

Thank you.

My bad, I didn't see a ring.

I'm wo... I'm working on it.

That's something I'm working on.

Can't just put any ring on the hand of the most perfect woman in the world.

Now shoo.

Back to the mechanical shop or wherever it is you work.

Enjoy.

Thank you.

Okay, so you're doing it again.

I'm doing what?

Ever since we got engaged, you've been acting insanely jealous.

Look, all bartenders get h*t on.

It's just part of the job.

Even Nick has groupies.

Are you free tonight?

I am, yeah.

Me, too!

(laughing): Oh, well, hey, well, I really hope you find something to do.

Winston: Nick is playing hard to get.

What was wrong with her?

I just wasn't feeling it.

What's "it"?

(scoffs) It's obvious.

It's, you know, it's...

(slurring): magic.

What?

Hmm?

Little bit of the magic thing, little bit of the...

"Man stick"?

I'm not saying "man stick."

It's what I heard.

I'm saying "magic."

Oh.

I don't know, I just... I want magic.

Is that so bad?

I want the music to swell.

I want the wind to blow.

I-I want the clouds to part.

Yeah.

Love! Magic!

Something exciting!

Why are you yelling?

Because I am embarrassed!

Don't be embarrassed, man, I want magic, too.

I want her to have a metal bra, and then I got a sword in my hand, and guess what, we both wearing skirts.

And we're riding on flying horses.

That's more like dork magic.

Okay, I don't want to upset you guys, but if you keep looking for magic, you're gonna be alone forever.

Did you just say you don't mean to upset us and then tell us we're gonna end up alone?

I actually don't care if I upset you.

Yeah, 'cause that's really upsetting.

You know, I got to... I got to say, I'm with Aly on this one, she's making sense, which is why she always plays "smart cop" when we play "Smart Cop/Dumb Cop."

Not a game we play.

I'm super worried you think we do, terrified.

I feel like we're playing it right now.

Great "dumb cop," great "smart cop."

You two need to get realistic.

You're not getting any younger, Nick.

Wrong.

You look familiar.

MTV Beach House, 2003.

How are you?

Oh, my God!

I'm so happy to see you.

You, too. You look incredible.

Barely recognized you.

Well, you've never seen me dry.

Cece, y-you went to the MTV Beach House?

Did you get to announce a video and then scream?

Actually, we both did.

Yeah.

And then we hooked up.

Yeah, that's true, too.

Is he okay?

It sounds like there's a dishwasher in his face.

I know, it's just, uh... he's just processing.

Oh, no, no, no. I'm just saying that it's all your fault, that you caused it.

-You're pathetic.

Yeah? You're pathetic.

You're pathetic.

You're pathetic.

You're pathetic.

You're pathetic, you're pathetic.

I'm amazing.

Yeah? Well, then, amaze me.

Stay and fix this.

What do you got?

You can pick one thing.

Easy. Uterus-shaped stress toy.

Not surprised.

(toy squeaking)

This is really helping, thank you.

Can I also get the double-sided pen?

No.

Winston: Hey, about earlier...

I'm sorry that I basically let you drown in the shower.

And then called you a soggy little bitch.

I don't know how to build a rain shower, okay?!

Help me!

I want to help you!

But I'm gonna get wet!

It's too late for you!

There's still time for me!

I'm sorry I squirted you with all that shampoo.

It... it was supposed to be a metaphor, but I-I really just panicked, to be honest with you.

I was trying to be tough, but it came off as mean.

No, I appreciate you looking out for me.

I-I've got no chance with Reagan.

She's hot and she's cool and she's bisexual.

That means she likes men and women.

I know what bisexual means.

I can't compete with that.

That's too many people, Winston, that's all the people!

It's time to stop chasing the magic.

Now I'm gonna ask out a girl who will not stop staring at me.

But why do I feel so nervous?

You know, I'll tell you why you're nervous, my friend: it's because you're human.

Because you're...

Where the hell is my cherry?

If you are so jealous that you want everyone else to know that Cece is engaged, hey, here's an idea... why don't you get her a ring?

Because I'm afraid that whatever ring I get her isn't gonna be good enough.

Are you worried that the ring won't be good enough or that you won't be good enough?

Aren't you smart?

Yeah, well, of course I am... I'm in sales.

That's so funny. I'm in marketing.

I don't care.

Look.

Cece is definitely too good for you.

I know.

No, but seriously.

Like, she's way too good for you.

No, I know that.

Like, you should have never had a sh*t.

It doesn't make any sense.

No, trust me.

I said, like, I-I've known this the whole time.

I understand quantum physics more than I understand how you ended up with Cece.

Don't you understand that this is the problem, and I don't understand where I got to where I am right now?

You're right, I'm sorry.

And I'm all turned around.

I'm sorry, let me try and fix it.

You have two choices.

You can either spend the rest of your life terrified that somebody's gonna swoop in and steal Cece away or you can just love her, and thank the universe that she loves you back for some reason.

I know what I have to do.

Come on, we got to go find Cece.

You got to go find Cece.

You're in this now, too, baby.

You're responsible for my marriage.

Don't you ever call me "baby" again.

You want to make this about you, Reagan?

Your car, I'm driving.

My car, I'm driving.

Your car, I'm driving.

My car, I'm driving.

Your car, you're driving.

Exactly.

I said the wrong thing.

Jen just agreed to go out with me any time, any day, anywhere. How do you feel?

Totally fine, bordering on no feeling at all.

Ah, yes, the sweet spot.

She seems really angry. We... we should probably go.

Go!

Okay, I thought you were giving me a hug.

Oh, hey, Schmidt.

Be careful, okay?

There's a guy over there that brought me flowers.

I might realize that I'm in love with him and run away.

Does he come in here often?

An unfortunate start.

Look, I'm sorry for not being open with you.

The truth is-is I still can't believe that you're gonna marry me.

You spent the summer of 2003 at the MTV Beach House.

I spent that same summer watching Felicity on VHS and recording a fake radio show where I reviewed snacks.

I love you.

And I know you love me.

And so... (gasps) I give you my trust.

You've always had it.

And I don't feel the need to show the world that I own you by putting some gaudy gem on your hand.

I love you.

Ha-ha!

But you are getting me a real ring.

You're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.

We can go tomorrow.

We'll pick it out together. (laughs)

I did that.

Hey, nice job.

Thank you.

Let me get you a drink.

(groans)

Hold on, why don't you take it easy, smush pain, I got it.

♪ I'd like to rest my heavy head ♪
♪ Tonight on a bed ♪
♪ Of California stars ♪
♪ I'd like to lay my weary bones... ♪

(music stops)

♪ I'd love to feel your hand touching mine ♪
♪ Tell me why ♪
♪ I must keep working on ♪
♪ Yes, I'd give my life ♪
♪ To lay my head tonight on a bed... ♪

That is a perfect old-fashioned.

I know.

(chuckles)

Magic.

Magic! That was magic.

Okay, you guys saw magic.

I watched a hot girl pour herself a drink and then leave without paying.

Wait, she left?

She's a robber.

Nick has a crush on a robber.

How did she leave so fast?

She's amazing.

Guys, we got to go get her now.

Let's go.

Cece, let's go!

Ah, son of a...

Cece: Schmidt, I'm coming!

Schmidt: Let's get her! Come on! Let's go!

Uh, you coming?

Oh, I would.

But I have to stay here and eat pretzels.

Okay, I'll call you with an update.

No.

I'll text you with an update.

Don't.

Uh, ma'am, we're surprising her because we want her to move in with us.

See, earlier I said, "Get out!"

And she did. (Nick, Cece, Winston clamoring)

Which was an embarrassing mistake by me.

I don't speak English.

Oh, where are you from?

Um, outside of Connecticut.

Nick: This is a good idea.

Great idea.

This is a great idea.

I'm very excited. (shushing)

(music playing over headphones)

All: We want you to move in with us!

9.9 miles...

This just got creepy.

Why did we do this?

I personally did it because I thought the idea was cinematic.

Schmidt: How loud is her music?

Cece: We just have to get out of here quickly and quietly... we can, we can go out the window.

Nobody's going anywhere.

We're not leaving without her. I got this.

Oh, no, no, no. What are you doing?

No, Nick.

I got it.

Nick, don't.

What are you doing?

I got it. Shh.

All: Nick.

(faint music playing)

Get off me!

Aw!

Ooh! Nick?

(Nick groaning)

What are you doing here?!

Thank you for the swift kick to the face.

Perhaps you want to live in our place.

(sighs) Genuinely didn't rhyme on purpose.

I think what he's trying to say is, we want you to come live with us.

Yeah. That's right.

I'm okay here.

I actually worked it out so that I get to pick out a lobster to eat at the end of every week.

It's a sick deal.

You know what's a sick deal?

Friendship. (all groan)

That's an unacceptable segue way.

I actually like being a loner.

It means fewer people break into my hotel room.

Okay, well, if you're such a loner, then why did you help me with Cece?

I don't know.

You could've left when I kicked you out.

You could've left when you caught me beasting that hunk of cheese.

That was disgusting.

But you stayed.

Now I'm not leaving.

And Cece's not leaving and Nick...

Well, Nick physically can't leave.

Winston's not leaving.

Hey, I'm Winston, by the way.

None of us are leaving until you agree to move in with us.

This is actually the kindest, creepiest thing that a group of people I've only known for four hours has ever done for me.

Ah, screw it.

I'm gonna move in!

Hey! Yes!

Okay, you're gonna hug, we're gonna hug? Okay.

Yeah, yeah.

It's happening.

Nick: I can't see what's going on, after being kicked in the head.

But I'm picturing a very happy scene.

Hey.

Hi.

Oh, no!

(both shouting)

Help me, Reagan!

I don't know how to turn it off!

Oh, my... (both screaming)

The handle... it's too tight!

Reagan: Let's try it together.

Cece: It's so wet. I can't, I can't get a grip on it!

No, is this, is this hot?

Hmm. Yeah, that's hot.

Aah, yeah, that's hot!

Oh, God, it's too wet and slippery!

No, Reagan, just if you put your...

I'm gonna use my teeth!

Cece: Yeah!

Okay.





(sighs)

Why are you putting spoons in the laundry hamper?

I'm hiding our nice stuff.

See, my cousin Bobby and Carol are coming in town, and they're gonna ask me for money, so I'm...

I'm trying my hardest to look poor.

You are poor.

Technically, yes, but I'm also the richest Miller in the history of our family.

I mean, I own part of a bar, I have a savings account.

I don't fully understand how to use it, but I do have it.

Nick, you're doing great; you really been stepping it up lately. Calm down.

Thanks. The other day...

The other day, I was at a restaurant, and they asked if I wanted avocado, and... and I said, "Yeah."

And they said, "It's extra," and I go, "Shh. I know it's extra, but... but I want it."

Uh, Winston, you ready to go?

Born ready!

You know, believe it or not, you guys, I have never been wedding dress shopping before, so I didn't really know what to pack.

Are those whistles?

Yeah. These are whistles.

Oh, I even got a pocket fan so I can blow wind in your face, and your hair could be all like this.

Pocket fan.

Cece, I'm begging you, just cancel the appointment and reschedule it for when Jess comes back.

There is a six-month waiting list.

Do you not want us to get married in June?

Oh, no, I want to get married in August, so I can walk down the aisle covered in flies.

You're so concerned about these flies.

Please, go to the appointment.

Look, relax.

All right? Nick is the best man, Jess is the maid of honor, and myself personally, this is where I cut loose.

This is where you unleash the beast, all right?

Speaking of which, uh, Cece, did you bring your strapless bra, or should I get the booby tape? Booby tape.

Cece: Uh, no, Winston, this is just a ride.

It is just a ride, okay?

Hey, guys, C-Cece, my cousins are almost coming!

Cece, hide your jewelry! Winston, hide your jewelry!

All the jewelry!

Nick, this is insane.

Just tell your family that you can't give them any money.

Set some boundaries.

You're right.

Time for me to put my foot down.

Put it down.

I'm gonna say no.

Yes.

I'm gonna set boundaries.

No money for them.

(knocking)

Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Hey, how you doing?

I thought I smelled fish!

(chuckles): Oh, yeah, you smelled fish.

Look at you, huh?

Yeah. Yeah.

What, are you working out now, huh?

Yeah.

Tough guy. - Ow!

You doing yoga? You doing yoga, huh?

Yeah, I do... I've done, yeah. I don't do yoga.

Bobby: Oh! Look at this.

Exposed brick, dude? Really? Oh, come on.

Yeah. Yeah, I didn't build this.

You don't want to throw some carpet down over the hardwood?

Yeah, what's wrong with wallpaper?

I love wallpaper. I'd use...

Don't forget about who you are, man. Look, he's getting weird.

Yeah.

(bad Boston accent): Welcome to Los Angeles. Maybe we take a... a-a-a, you know, a "cah" down to the "hahbah" and check out The "Mahtian" on the big... on the big screen with Matt Damon in "Mahs."

Whose "cah" we taking?

(whispers): Stop, Schmidt.

Hey, we got you a little gift, yeah?

You didn't have to do that.

Yeah.

Oh, I left it outside in the hall.

Well, go get it, you moron.

Bobby: You're a moron, you moron.

I'm not the one who left it in the hallway.

Why didn't you bring it in if you saw it?

Carol: Because I didn't see it until now.

Yeah, 'cause you're a maniac, and you're controlling me all the time.

Oh, my God, I love you so much!

I love you, too, Peaches.

You're the best!

(sighs)

Regular Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, these two.

This is how it starts. There's three stages to a Miller asking for money: okay, it's compliments, it's ply with food, and then it's go in for the k*ll.

Schmidt: Be strong.

I'm trying to be strong.

Carol: Seems like there's a space theme. You guys like space?

Outer space? Yes.

Yeah.

Ah, you didn't have to do this.

I got it at the airport.

Yeah. Hey.

Schmidt: There it is.

It's popcorn.

Oh!

Yeah. Comes all fancy-like in its own trash can.

That's too much. That's too nice.

No, come on.

I love this kind of popcorn.

You're totally hooked up, brother.

'Cause you can mix and match.

That's right.

Easy. Nick's not hungry.

Oh, that's right.

Is he your life coach?

Thank you for the offer, but...

Nick, eat the popcorn.

He just ate.

I just ate. - Just one piece.

Nick, it's popcorn.

Do it. Do it. - I don't want it.

It's good for you. It's corn!

You're trying to give me popcorn so that I give you money!

It's not gonna happen! I'm not giving you money!

I'm setting boundaries!

Oh, Nicky, we don't want your money.

You don't?

No!

No, no.

We want your sperm.

What?

Yeah, we're trying to start a family, and Bob's army's down.

I need your troops to storm my beaches.

S-So no money?

No.

Just sperm?

Yep.

Don't tell anybody, all right?

Guys, this is excellent. I got a lot of that.

If I had a dollar for every sperm, my room would be covered in dollar bills.

Nick, a word, please. A word.

Carol: Right? Right?

Nick: Yeah. Yeah.

A word.

Yeah. Thanks for the popcorn, too.

One minute.

What's that guy, like, his manager?

Doesn't quite feel like the one, and it doesn't really feel like it's me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it is you.

It is beautiful.

It has an attachment for a leash.

No judgments.

Wink, wink, right? (laughs)

But it does.

Do you mind if I just take one minute to think about it?

Pass.

Pass. Pass. Pass.

Cece: Winston, I just asked you to drop me off.

Sir, what is your role here?

I am her friend.

My job is to protect her, so, please, cut the caca, and bring us some dresses with an A-line cut.

I may or may not have done an extensive amount of research on wedding dresses.

I never thought that I would say this, but I am really glad that you're here.

So you're gonna take his word over my word?

(whistle bl*ws)

(laughs, whoops)

That's the one! We got dibs!

Nick: Schmidt, this is great. They just want my sperm.

What about setting boundaries?

They're not just reaching into your wallet this time, Nick.

They're reaching into your skin wallet.

That's your scrotum.

I got it.

I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to veto this.

Yeah, well, you have no standing to veto.

It's my sperm.

You're my best friend in the whole entire world.

We've been through a lot together, so I just do feel like... your sperm are partly my sperm.

Mi leche es su leche.

No! No!

Nick, you've been doing so well lately.

Thank you.

Right on track with the plan.

My... What plan? What are you talking about?

I-I may have your entire life planned out on my computer.

I made a spreadsheet and everything.

I worked on it this morning.

You-You've got to be kidding me.

I don't... It's not...

"Nick's Life Plan"?

What is that?!

I'm just trying to keep you on track, Nick.

Look, we've always done everything together, and I'm just worried that we're gonna drift apart.

You know, I'm gonna get married and have kids, and you're gonna be wandering around the grocery store, holding a bottle of Scotch and an ear of corn.

Okay, you know what?

You know what I have to say to you, Schmidt? Boundaries.

You know, you and me.

Boundaries.

All right, let's do this.

We're having a baby!

Yes. - Yeah.

Carol: Oh, my God, my boobs are gonna get huge! (laughs)

Unbelievable!

They're gonna be like, "Get out of my way.

Here come my boobs."

Bobby and Carol: Yankees suck! Yankees suck! Yankees suck!

This really means a lot to me, man.

I'm sorry I couldn't do it myself.

Yeah, you know what I think it was?

One time, I got stung in the penis five different times by five different bees five days in a row.

What were you doing that your naked penis was exposed to bumblebees?

Why is he here?

You know, even though I don't approve of this, I would never, ever leave you in your time of need.

Schmidt, I don't want you here.

I told him I didn't want him here.

I can't be any more clear on that.

I botched it!

Botched it good! Three strikes, and you're out!

How do you botch it?

You do not have my blessing.

I don't need your blessing.

I don't want it. I don't care.

I don't even want you here.

Nurse: Mr. Miller, we're ready for you.

Thank you so much.

Here I go.

Nicky, give 'em hell, huh?

Yeah.

Get me a winner.

All right? You got it.

Carol: All right. - All right.

Go get 'em, Nicky.

We believe in you. Come on, make a smart one.

Here we go!

Bobby: Yeah!

Hey, Schmidt, can I have a...

So you do need my blessing!

I don't need you! Just please come back in here with me.

Thank you.

Never seen two guys so close like that, you know.

My dad and his... and his friend Joe were close like that.

Oh, yeah?

Mm-hmm.

Well, you got in my head.

You got in my head.

Why'd you have to tell me about the plan, Schmidt?

Now I need to know what happens.

Why am I not supposed to have a baby this way?

As I saw it, your first child was to be born between you and a small Italian woman.

Like a Maria?

Yes, like a Maria.

Okay.

She makes meatballs and soup, and does laundry in a wooden bucket.

Yeah, she does.

You guys have a child.

It's a boy. I'm incredibly involved.

I give him the other half of a walkie-talkie just in case he ever has a question in the middle of the night.

(imitates static) Yes, I'm here.

He hides his broccoli in a planter during dinner.

I wink. I look the other way.

You mean e-broccoli.

What?

'Cause it's the future.

How far in the future are you planning on having a child?

Well, if we're talking about me meeting a woman, falling in love and having a kid?

A very, very, very, very long time.

So many "verys."

And let's face the facts.

My love life is a disaster.

Schmidt, this might be my only chance of having a kid.

Don't say that.

I'm saying it.

And if I can't have a kid with a woman, then maybe I'll have one with my cousin.

Horrifying wording for what actually is, well, a beautiful sentiment.

I-I want to do this.

I want to experience this.

You know, and I know I won't be able to raise him, and... and that's disappointing, but...

I'll still see the little guy at parties and such.

Say hi. He'll say hi.

Give him some fireworks to pop off, or... or e-fireworks.

Man, I'm just...

I'm getting excited just thinking about this.

Look, it's not how I originally planned it, but it's still another Nick Miller in the world, and I'll take that any way I can get it.

You have my blessing.

Well, it's embarrassing to admit, but... thanks, man, I kind of needed it.

Yeah, absolutely.

(laughs)

You should get out of here, man. I'm gonna go masturbate.

Okay.

(groaning)

We... really got after it there.

I am so happy I could help.

Like, I don't want to be... greedy about it, 'cause I know I've already put on the most perfect dress once today, and I should wait...

You thinking what I'm thinking?

I really want to put it on again.

You should put it on again.

I know!

Okay, I'm going to go try it on.

Okay, try it on again.

Okay.

Cece: Oh, no!

Oh, no.

What did we do?

What is this?

Oh, my God!

How drunk were we?

No.

No. Okay.

You know what, no, no, no, no.

This is, you know what, this is, this is good.

Everything's all right.

I mean, look, you got mirrors.

You know, no one's ever done that before.

I like it, you know. I like the...

Again, I can't talk enough about the mirrors.

Why is there a spot for batteries?

So the glass can light up.

We were really excited about that feature.

Yeah. You look like a prost*tute for wizards.

I look like a bullfighter in space.

I cannot get married in this dress.

Okay, so what do you need me to do?

Nothing. I don't need your help.

Okay. 'Cause I'm just...

I'm gonna do it by myself.

Well...

Yeah, well, no, I...


You washed?

Yeah, of course I washed.

Hey, why the... why the long faces?

Shouldn't we be celebrating here, guys?

Listen, we, uh, we talked to the doctor and, uh, turns out we can't afford the procedure.

Are you kidding me?

So I just masturbated for nothing?

Schmidt: You-you guys flew across the country.

You didn't think about any of this beforehand?

We did little to no research.

But we still want to have a family, you know.

Yeah.

We already fell in love with the little bastard.

Anyway, there is one other option we could explore.

What is it? Anything.

Nick...

I want you to have sex with my wife.

What?

Carol: Yeah, we don't just need your reindeer, we need Santa.

Schmidt: What? What?

Yeah, come down the chimney.

Feet first.

White Christmas.

Bring a sackful of gifts.

This is nuts. I can't do this.

This might be your only chance to have a kid.

Yeah, but then I have to have sex with my cousin.

I don't want to have... I don't want to have sex with my cousin.

It's not your cousin. It's your cousin's wife.

That's like letting a dog drink water out of your mouth.

You know, it's not great, but it's legal.

The point I'm trying to make is, is I think I'd like another Nick Miller in the world.

All right.

Can you imagine?

(chuckles)

Come on, man, what do you say?

(sighs)

Schmidt: I think the best thing to do here is to just look at this like a medical procedure.

Why is this guy in this conversation here?

Bobby, it's a losing battle. Just move past it.

And, Carol, look, I don't want this to feel, I-I don't know, romantic.

I don't want you getting confused.

There's a zero percent chance of that happening.

Yeah.

If you're suggesting that I can't be romantic, then you're out of your mind.

Schmidt: Yeah, excuse me, Nick is very romantic, okay?

He does romantic things for me all the time.

Schmidt, what are you talking about?

Just the other week, you were very romantic to me.

When I fell down in the parking lot and you picked me up?

(talking indistinctly)

(grunts)

Get up, dude!

How was that romantic?!

It was beautiful and it was kind.

You know, romance doesn't always have to be sexual, you idiot.

You're the idiot!

Don't. Don't.

Honestly, you want to do this right now?

Give me one sh*t at that big head, I'm gonna knock you out. (chuckles)

Dominated you physically. Admit it.

Yeah, defense.

Can we put something over the windows?

I want it to be pitch black in here, so I can't see...

I don't like the way you look at my body when you say that, Carol.

Well...

Schmidt: Okay, we got to keep it positive.

I agree.

I think what Nick is trying to say Uh-huh.

Is that he'd like to be completely naked.

Where are you getting this from?!

Objection, Your Honor! Strongly!

'Cause I will be wearing clothes!

Overruled. Yeah.

Overruled.

Yeah, stand down.

But I'll-I'll tell ya, I'm not wearing a condom! End of discussion.

(laughs)

Guys... such a clearly great joke.

Because obviously I can't wear, you know...

Oh.

We got to loosen the vibe a little.

Can we do something about this smell?

Oh, yeah.

(sniffs) It is a little rank, yeah.

There is an odor.

Yeah.

Well, I lost a glass of milk.

You lost a glass of milk? Was it full?

Yeah, it was to the top.

I could barely carry it.

Oh, that's outrageous!

Oh, God.

Now, if you don't mind, I'd just like to bring things down for a second here.

Bob, Carol, um, I originally bought this for Nick, but since he may never have someone to give it to, I'd like for you guys to have it.

Mm-mm.

No, dude, no.

We're Pats fan. We hate the Bears.

You don't like the onesie?

Pats are number onesie.

Where did we land on me being in the room?

Get out, Schmidt!

Get the hell out of here!

Look, I-I know that you have a "no return" policy, but you have to take this dress back, okay?

I look like a rich person in The Hunger Games.

Yeah, I know. (chuckles)

I was gonna stop you from buying it, but I didn't, so we're done here.

Wrong!

See, you may be done with her, but you're not done with the law.

Winston Bishop, LAPD.

You're a cop? The guy who was spinning around singing Patti LaBelle songs yesterday?

(high-pitched): ♪ I tidied up my point of view ♪
♪ I got a new attitude.

And you must be the one who was serving champagne without a liquor license.

We don't charge for it.

It's legal.

Uh, not if it's being served to a-a minor.

Oh.

Yeah. Oh, that's right.

I'm 17 years old. I'm a kid.

You're a 17-year-old police officer?

I'm a cop prodigy.

You see, my school is the streets.

But my other school is school.

'Cause-'cause I go to school.

Like a school-school, for learning.

You are so stupid.

No return policy is more important than the love that brings us here today, so...

This means a lot to her, so please help her out.

Well, that didn't work.

Look, Cece, I'm-I'm no good at this.

I'm no help. I'm just gonna...

I'm just gonna take a backseat to the wedding.

No. Look... what you did in there made me realize how much you... really care about me.

I know that you're already one of Schmidt's groomsmen, um, but I was hoping you would maybe also consider being one of my bridesmaids.

You want me to be a bridesmaid?

If you don't want to, I...

Do you know who you're talking to?

Yes?

You're talking to Winnie the Bish!

Yeah.

I would love to be your bridesmaid!

Yes?

Yes!

Yes?

Yes!

Oh...

Girl, you are under arrest for taking my breath away!

(laughs)

What's with this parachute top?

It's good for movement, hard to stain.

I thought it was appropriate.

Okay. I don't know what you think we're about to do, but I'm keeping this very simple.

I want to keep it simple.

Uh-huh. Great.

Should we... should we just make love now, then?

"Make love"?

What, are we riding horses around on a beach topless?

No, thank you.

Just tip me over and pour me out!

Tip you over and pour you out?

Yeah. It's that children's rhyme that's also very sexual.

It is not sexual at all.

It is in this case.

Carol, I'm g... I'm gonna need you to be a little bit nicer to me, please.

Oh, my God, are you serious?

I can't p...

Listen, I can't perform sexually if I don't feel a-at least a little desired.

Okay.

Could you give me any sort of a compliment? Anything.

We'll go and then we'll just... That will get me started.

I'll say something nice about you then and we can get into it.

(groans)

Just one compliment.

Nothing on the front. Can you turn around?

No. Keep turning.

No.

Stop. Ah!

Okay, I won't... Okay.

Please.

Um...

First thing that pops in your head.

(sighs)

Oh, Nicky, you're such a sexy boy.

(groans)

It felt crazy coming out of my mouth. Right?

Just some... just something simple.

Oh, my God.

Just take your pants off and get in bed.

Okay, yeah. All right!

Okay?

(breathing deeply)

Come on!

(sportscast playing over TV)

Any plans to go to the beach while you're in Los Angeles?

Carol: Bob! He's freaking out!

Oh.

Nick?

I'm not freaking out. I'm fine. Just my heart's b*ating really fast.

I feel a bit dizzy.

Carol: Are you freaking kidding me?

Just need one sec.

This is ridiculous!

All I did was take my shoes off.

Stand up and deliver!

What happened? What happened?

Is it over? Did you like it?

No! Look at him.

I just need one minute. I just need one minute.

Everything's cool! Deal's on. I just need one minute.

Get ahold of yourself, man!

Hey, I'm ovulating for two more hours. I need to get plowed!

You're dressed like you're gonna run a marathon!

Take off your windbreaker!

Schmidt, tell them to stop yelling at me!

No! You compose yourself and you make a miracle, or I will squeeze one out of you like a bottle of mustard!

What?!

Take your pants off!

There's not even a belt or a button!

Just pull 'em down!

Yeah, let's go with the miracle already!

Come on, man!

(all shouting)

No! Stop! Stop!

Just take your pants off!

Five minutes, and it's done.

I don't like this! I don't like this!

Take your pants off!

Do it! Do it, Nick!

Come on, man! Do it!

Take it out and do it!

Boundaries! I said I need boundaries!

Get out of my way!

I need boundaries!

Unbelievable.

Wow. So typical.

(sighs)

Oh, look at that.

There's the glass of milk.

Really is filled to the brim. It's like an infinity pool.

Wow, how the hell did he carry that thing?

Bobby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

No, no, no, no. It was a bad call.

Yeah, I guess it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.

No. I...

I just can't stomach my kid coming from a Bears fan, that's all.

There's nothing wrong with being a Bears fan.

That's all I'm gonna say to that.

There kind of is.

No, it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.

That's what's weird.

We're gonna ask Cousin Terry.

He's got no arm past his elbow, but it was an accident; it's not genetic.

It's a good call. He's very good-looking.

Uh, excuse me. So we're not having a baby?

Well, this is... this is just great.

If you can't tell, I am being sarcastic.

What's with that guy?

(sighs) He was really fat as a kid.

Now I get it.

Ah, that makes sense.

Yeah.

We need to have a talk about today.

I know. Boundaries.

No.

It's...

I want you to have something.

What's this for?

I want you to save that and give it back to me when I have my own kid.

What do you mean, you're gonna have your own kid?

When I have my own kid. Don't make a big deal of it.

I just... I don't... I don't hate your plan.

I kind of like it.

Things have been going pretty good for me lately, and I-I would like to meet my own Maria.

With-a the meatballs.

With-a the red sauce.

(laughs): With-a the red sauce.

I want to see that plan you got for me.

Well, come on, man.

It's a rough draft, but you should check it out.

What do we got here, chief?

"Nick has a boy. He calls him Gio."

We die on the same day in 2098?

You m*rder me and then k*ll yourself.

There's not a chance I make it to 2098.

Not a chance.

I don't want to see the 2050s.

Oddly enough, you won't.

See? I freeze you from 2050 to 2064.

That's why you're the genius. That's why you're the genius.

Thank you.

(chuckles)

Can you see her?

Jess?

Hey. Hey, guys. I pulled some strings.

I got her a note that says we're here.

You are amazing. I don't know why every wedding doesn't have a bridesman.

Ooh, I'm-a get so naked at that bachelorette party!

That's one reason.

(all cheering)

Cece and Nick: Jess!

Okay, Nick, the bag, the bag, the bag, the bag. Okay. Okay.

I got it, I got it. I got the bag. What do you mean, the bag?

Oh, come on! Just one peek!

No!

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Okay. We good?

Yeah, we're good.

Okay.

(exhales)

Hey. Hey, hey, guys. She's writing something.

Wait for it. Oh...

What? What's happening?

Don't worry. Nothing.

I think she's writing something else.

Okay. All right. That's something.

What's going on?!

Nice.

_ - NICK: We miss you, too!

Cece: Aw, we miss you, too!

All right, I can't take it anymore!

Cece: No!

No, no, no. No, no, no. No, Jess can fix it.

Jess can fix it.

Schmidt? Schmidt?

Cece: Just... No, no.

Cover up. It's not gonna look like this.

I got him. I got him.

You got him? Okay.

Winston, I got him. It's fine.

See? Everything's fine!

This isn't romantic?

Nick: Come back soon!

Winston: I love you!





Opening statements today in the trial of celebrity chef Susanna Gabey, accused of k*lling her husband.

The special tonight: cold-blooded m*rder.

The jury is expected to be sequestered four weeks.

Ooh, look, that's her. (laughs)

Anchorman: In this high profile case, initial courtroom reports note an annoyingly inquisitive jury.

In otter news, an otter was born at the zoo today.

Oh!

Oh, dip.

I can't believe Jess is gonna be sequestered. for so long.

Who am I supposed to go to for lady advice now?

I mean, I'm having a real crisis with KC.

Nick: It's not a crisis.

She posted a photo of another dude; it's no big deal.

Yeah, but when I asked her about it, she said, "He's a work friend, Winston. Slow down."

I'm like, "Slow down? We've been dating for four months already. I've seen one of your breasts."

What was the situation where you only saw one of her breasts?

We were playing dinosaur.

Look, I just need Jess.

Winston, it's gonna be okay, because I can help.

I told Jess that I was gonna take care of her boys while she was away.

What, you don't think I can be supportive?

(phone chimes)

No...

Todd is in town.

Ploons?

Are you kidding me?

Went to college with this guy.

He's the worst guy on Planet Earth.

(dance music playing)

His grandfather invented the springs that go inside pens.

He's got, like, a billion dollars.

Once he paid apl.de.ap from The Black Eyed Peas to hang out with him, just so he could look cool.

How much are you guys gettin' paid for this?

Bunch of marijuana.

And these carrots.

(phone chimes)

Ugh.

I just got a text from him.

"Nick the Dick"... hate that...

"it's Hot Daddy T"... hate that...

"in La-La Land."... hate that...

"Excited to talk bachelor party with you. Vegass?"

He spelled "Vegas" with two S's.

He spelled it with two?

That's ass. That's Veg-ass.

You see what he did?

You see what he did?

It's so like Ploons to assume he's coming to the bachelors party.

He said Vegas?

You can't invite him, Schmidt.

On the other hand, you know, a bachelor party does cost a lot of money.

I'm your best man.

I got this bachelors party under control, buddy.

First of all, you're saying "bachelors party," which is wrong.

Okay, so where we going?

Where are we going?

Yeah.

For the party?

For the party, yeah.

We don't have to go anywhere.

You want to go somewhere, right?

Uh...

Nick: We're going someplace.

Someplace that is so much better than what Ploons could do.

Well, he'd go to Vegas, which... which sounds awesome.

We're going to Tokyo!

I mean, look at you. You're obsessed with Japanese culture, you wear the kimono, right?

I'm gonna take you where Ploons can never take you.

I'm taking you to Tokyo.

(choked up): This... this is pimp.

This is so pimp.

(crying): I just really need to know, um...

(clears throat)

I was gonna say, how are we paying for all of this?

Doesn't matter.

How does anybody pay for anything?

Winston: No, no, seriously, how are we paying for this?

Boom, boom, boom...

(imitates playing guitar)

Who cares?

Both: We're going to Tokyo!

(humming Super Mario Bros. underground levels music)

Is there a three-prong outlet in here somewhere?

(vocalizing)

God, I love echoes in bathrooms.

It's so good.

Hey, there's a stranger in the bathroom.

That's just Brandon.

Who the hell is Brandon?

Brandon's how we're paying for Tokyo, Schmidt.

You see, I put a thing online.

I'm renting out Jess's room while she's gone.

Oh...

I'm gonna rent out all the rooms.

Are you insane?

I don't think so, no.

Do you have any idea the amount of bodily fluids that people let loose onacation?

Brandon's a really good guy.

He's just here to finish his novel.

I appreciate the effort, I do, but we don't need to go to... we don't need to go to Tokyo.

Not for this. I'm not willing to turn our home into a public pool.

One: I understand your concern and I'll make note of it.

You're not even typing.

Two: I already bought the tickets and they're nonrefundable.

We need to come up with $9,000.

You don't need Jess's bowl of advice, Winston, all right?

I really do, CeCe.

I mean, look. She's cheating on me.

KC's cheating on me.

Hmm.

The same thing happened with Daisy.

Everything's all good, then all of a sudden, she's hiding a basketball player in the shower and I own a cat!

I'm in a cycle.

I'm in a bad woman cycle.

She posts a picture with a hot guy, you post a picture with a hot girl.

That-that's great. That's perfect advice, CeCe.

I know. Thank you very much.

You're welcome.

If only I knew a hot girl.

Hmm.

Ah...

Trust me, it'll work.

I've done the math, and if we rent out every room for a month, we'll have enough money, we won't need Todd.

The hospitality industry is fast-paced and it's detail-oriented.

And you have the focus of a coked-up Italian on a summer day.

I'm very focused.

You're not even looking at me right now.

I thought I saw something shiny.

Um...

But no, it was nothing.

How do you drive your car and not h*t people?

I have never been more focused in my...

It was a spoon.

I saw the... it was just a spoon.

Nick, let's just call Todd.

Let's bite the b*llet...

No, Schmidt, we don't need his money. Look at me.

(sighs) Okay...

Schmidty, I'm your best man.

And I may not be a rich man.

The only thing my parents invented was a wand to push the buttons on the microwave from the table, so you don't have to get up.

You mean like a stick?

My point is, it's my job to give you the bachelors party of your dreams.

And I intend on doing that.

Why don't you close your eyes for me?

What do you see when you see your dream bachelors party?

Sushi.

(chuckles) A lot of it.

Sake.

Honor.

And no Todd, right?

Look around. Is Todd there?

'Cause we don't need him.

We can do this.

I want you to look at me and tell me you believe we can do this.

Do you believe, Schmidty?

Do you believe?

Schmidty? Do you believe?

I believe...!

Do you believe?

I believe!

Yeah!

I'm gonna eat sushi off my own ass!

Why you using tongs?

We don't use tongs at home.

Don't forget to write your reviews and it'd be nice if you mentioned Nick.

So you're just full-bl*wn running a hotel now?

Man: All right, let's go.

It's a boutique hotel, yes.

We are offering a premiere experience in a competitive marketplace.

Okay? And the reviews are everything.

So grab a vacuum...

I'm gonna go take my 15.

It's not time for a break. You just started working.

It takes a staff to run...

There's no work ethic there... how do you work...?

(phone ringing)

Look at that.

KC took the bait.

I gotta take my 15.

Uh, hello? What it do, Jacques?

Everybody's taking their 15.

Got no staff.

Kumiko, how are you?

Hey, Kumiko.

Kumiko, you're from Japan, yes?

Well, you know, Nick and I are going to Japan. Any tips?

Yes?

Cleaning.

She's talking about the shower.

Oh!

Schmidt: Yes.

Let me help you with that shower.

Okay, you just... stay there for a second, cowboy.

Please.

We're running a business here.

We're running a hotel.

No sex with the guests.

You gotta focus, here.

Hey, you know this: I'm a businessman first.

Yes.

I'm a sex guy second.

Okay?

Stay focused, man.

No sex, no Todd.

No Todd.

Tokyo!

Tokyo.

♪ ♪

Oh. Thought you were Nick.

Well, uh, KC saw the picture.

Oh, great, you're welcome.

And she instantly broke up with me.

(softly): Oh.

Um...

I'm sorry.

You okay?

Yeah.

(loud continuous sob)

(sob winds down)

(sob resumes)

This is your fault.

I need Jess.

No, you know what, no, you don't need, you don't need Jess.

'Cause I'm here, and I've got this.

So what can I do that's Jess-like?

You want some, you want some tea?

You want, like, cupcakes or a cute song?

I need Jess.

Okay, you know what, I'm gonna do the tea thing.

How about I do the tea thing for you, and then I'll, it'll soothe you, okay?

So, how do I, how do you make tea?

How do you make tea?!

I'll fig... I'll figure it out. I'll just get some water and I'll ta...

Yeah.

You know, it's...

Water and leaves!

Water and leaves!

Water and leaves.

So, this is hot, and this is cold.

Yes. (chuckles)

Wet down there.

Wet down there.

Oh, I don't need to know that, Kumiko.

That is, that is not my business.

Wet down there!

Oh, you mean down there! Yeah...

Yes!

That's really...

(groans)

Yes, that's, yeah, that's actually, yeah. Let me get in the drain.

Sorry about that glass.

(chuckles)

I was in the zone writing, and I just...

It's just a glass, right?

Yeah.

As a reminder, there's some plastic disposable cups, literally, right there, so there's no need to rummage through the cabinets with your travelers' hands.

Okay.

Okay.

But how's the novel coming?

Oh, I mean, I'm stuck on a love scene.

Ain't that always the case?

Couldn't imagine.

Listen to this.

What?

"As his electric car powered down, the first thing he saw was..."

No, look at me.

Look at me.

Do I have to?

Yeah.

"...first thing he saw was her virgin breasts glowing in the Alabama moonlight. She said, 'Which one do you want to see? The left or the right?' And I said, 'Both.' She said, 'No, pick one.' So I said, 'Left.' She finally showed him, and it was as big as a Cadillac. She grabbed him by the potatoes and led him up the stairs. So many stairs. Left, right, left, right, left, right.

He grabbed the bannister and then let go."

Oh, that's erotic stuff.

Oh, thank you.

You're very welcome.

That's very sexy stuff you're writing.

Thanks.

The sexiest, really.

Where the hell have you been?

"The parakeet was still in the room, but it turned out to be a welcome addition to the games at hand."

Lose that one?

I don't even get that one. I didn't get that one.

Let go of it. I have no emotional connection.

You're cracking; take your 15.

I'm not cracking.

Oh!

Nuts.

You weak-handed moron!

Hey!

Who also is our cherished guest here.

It's just the weight of it.

The liquid and the balance of it... I'm so sorry.

I'll help clean it up.

No, please, let me clean it up.

You keep writing.

(clicks tongue)

I think you're cracking.

You need to take your 15.

I don't need a 15; I'm gonna take a 15 more of work.

You need a 15; take a 15.

Pull it together.

I will not take a 15 ever again in my whole life.

I'm so sorry about this. Take a 15.

"She took a 15 on my face."

Focus.

Focus!

Nick: Sorry about the little misunderstanding there, all right?

(chuckles)

This oolong tea?

Yeah.

Yeah, well, Jess never gives me caffeine.

Why wouldn't you tell me that?

You know, this breakup has got me going crazy, Cece.

So you just need to calm down, okay?

I'm gonna need you to nurture me.

I'm gonna need you to nurture me.

Okay, all right, I can do that part. Here we go.

So, um, maybe this breakup isn't such a bad thing.

Mm-hmm.

Now you can stop wasting your life and find someone more realistic.

Yeah, someone who's, like, in your league.

What?

Because you don't want to die alone, so you kind of have to settle and lower your standards and find someone that's just, like, in your lane.

What...?

If you stay in your lane, you'll be happy, 'cause you won't be alone.

Right?

What are you saying?

Someone a little older, dumpier.

(crying): You are so bad at this.

For crying out loud.

Who do we give our laundry to?

The ad said it was included.

I suppose, I suppose me, uh, I guess.

Here you go.

Oh, dear Lord.

Where do the entertainment types tend to hang out?

Crystal is a performer.

We'd love to get her in front of the right set of eyes.

This is all underpants.

Showtime!

Mm... No, oh, no, no.

Crystal!

Schmidt: Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, honey, no acting.

I feel that you're gonna start a monologue of some sort, and I really don't want to hear it. I have no tolerance.

Please, I'm begging you.

(clears throat)

Is that your moment before? Please don't do that.

You don't know what out of order is, What the hell?

Mr. Trask!

If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place!

Pacino, Scent of a Woman.

I got the referen...

Wait a minute.

Is that my cashmere window pane blazer?

I know it was you, Fredo.

You broke my heart.

Do you only do Pacino?

(kisses)

You knock him down.

Why don't you try knockin' me down now?

Rocky V?

No, no, in the ring.

Tommy g*n only fights in the ring.

Of all the Rockys?

Baby, let's do the cop one. Do Heat.

Don't do Heat. I'm... Oh, God.

'Cause she's got a great ass!

Nickolo.

What up, my man?

You got a weird vibe right now, bud.

I called Todd.

W-W... You just say, "Hi, what's up?

No.

Don't come to the bachelor party."

No, I made plans with him.

I'm gonna invite him and ask him to pay.

What?! You...

I'm sorry!

♪ I hear the blues a-callin' ♪
♪ Tossed salad and scrambled eggs ♪

Is she listening to Frasier reruns?

I'm in the middle of a fight with you.

There's this one episode, right?

Where Niles, he's making an origami flower, and Frasier comes in and asks...

Well, I'm sorry, actually, it's Daphne that comes in and asks...

Why'd you invite Todd!

Is that what Daphne asks?

'Cause if I'm Daphne, that's what I'm asking.

He sucks. I could've done it!

Then what does, uh, Frasier say?

You would never be Frasier in this scenario.

Who would I be?

Obviously the dad, the lazy piece of dump that sits on the chair.

And you just broke my heart.

(Kumiko giggles)

Cece: Well, the McQuaids sure left a mess.

Winston: Nick, I would just like to say that you had a vision for this hotel.

I'd also like to say that I may die alone.

It could happen.

Yeah.

Be nice if you surprised us.

I'll try.

Okay, look, Nick, I'm sorry that I called Todd.

You can suck Todd's gas till you're blue in the face, but I won't.

Not now, not ever.

I'll pay my own way to Tokyo, 'cause he hotel's still open, so...

Kumiko seems happy.

You could get some money back from her.

Yeah.

I ca... I'm not gonna charge her; I can't charge her.

What?

Why wouldn't you charge her?

Why can't you charge Kumiko?

To be honest, because we had a sexual encounter.

There we go.

Shame, shame.

Schmidt: I knew it, Nick!

You weren't in the bathroom fixing the shower.

You were showing her the business center.

Okay, in my defense, it wasn't in the shower.

It was in the hallway for a few moments.

Don't refer to it as a hallway. Yuck.

I literally meant the hallway.

And it was vibrant, if that's a word you could use in this situation, 'cause that's what it was; it was like...

Just admit it, Nick, you screwed up.

I did not screw up!

Well, you certainly can't charge her now.

Yes, I can.

Sure I can.

Hey, Kumiko.

Can I have a minute of your time?

(grunts)

(sighs deeply) I had a...

I enjoyed our special time today.

I haven't taken my pants off in front of a woman in quite some time.

I'm sorry that the pretzel fell out.

That was unexpected.

I honestly don't know how long it was in my underpants, and that was disturbing to me.

Thank you for not overreacting to it.

I'm here to talk about money.

American currency.

Our special time was not included, financially, in the room rate.

'Cause I'm running a business.

And I can't be soft here.

I understand.

I give you money.

Thank you for being so cool! That's what... Yes.

You are prost*tute.

Working boy.

No, no.

I want sex.

You want sex.

But need money.

prost*tute.

Hotel owner.

Sorry, Winston, I mean, this is all my fault.

No, no, no, no. No, Cece, you're fine.

You were right. You really were.

I mean, KC and I were, we weren't going anywhere.

Let's be honest.

I just want to find somebody, Cece; I really do.

So bad it hurts.

From my head to my turd pipe.

That's... sweet.

I got so much love to give, Cece.

I really do, so why am I always on the phone, getting dumped, crying my eyes out like an idiot?

Well, there must be something that you can do.

Well, you know, if Jess were here, she would tell me to: (imitating Jess) "Just believe in yourself, Winston, and, like, be positive."

Well, forget what Jess would say and forget what I would say.

What do you think would really break the cycle?

I just want, for once in my life, for someone to cry over me.

Right, okay, explore that.

Somebody to just cry because of...

That's a great idea, Cece!

It is?

Yes!

This is what I'm gonna do.

We're gonna make KC cry over me.

Oh, no, no, that's not, that's not where I thought you were going...

We're gonna make a girl cry today!

Couldn't take the money?

Thought you were a prost*tute?

(wry laugh)

It's time for Todd.

Yeah, okay.

All right.

You ever taken gloves off before?

We could've paid for Tokyo, but a business venture went south and ultimately, it was my fault because the company was my baby.

I can't believe you guys have never been to Tokyo.

I've been there 28 times!

Where do you guys get your sneakers?

28 times?

Yes.

And you idiots couldn't even figure out how to get there once?

Ha! You know what you deserve for that, Nick?

What?

You deserve a one-nut slap, my friend.

You're not slapping one of my nuts, Todd.

Oh, yes, I am.

I'm an adult man.

Tokyo?

Get that leg up, come on.

All right.

Get that nut!

This is for you, best man. We're going to Tokyo.

Yeah, get it up there. Here we go.

Ooh...

Okay, no!

S-Stop it!

What!?

Get your hand out of here!

Oh!

You're not slapping anybody's nuts.

Boo!

Schmidt: We don't need your money, Todd.

I'm gonna love my bachelor party, no matter what.

You're my best man. We're gonna do this.

Yeah, we can do this.

That's right.

It doesn't matter.

I do, however, still owe $9,000.

Wow. You guys are good friends.

Yep.

Yeah.

I don't have any friends.

No one likes me.

Ooh, why would you say that, Todd?

I have a terrible personality.

True.

(sobs quietly)

You're fake crying, aren't you?

No I'm not! I'm...

Yeah, all right, you guys caught me.

(choking)

I see it in your mouth.

Look, there she is.

Hey, Winston, I am not doing this, all right?

It is the worst idea that I have ever heard.

Uh, remember when you said, "I'm Cece. I'm super supportive"?

Now's your time to shine.

Yes, it isn't like a blank check, though.

This idea does not deserve to be supported, because it's insane.

Yeah, that's what I need, Cece!

I need insane!

Look, Cece, it's no big deal, but I need this more than I've needed anything in my entire life.

(groaning): I don't want to...

Cece: KC, um... I really... wish I didn't have to be the one to tell you this, but Winston is d*ad.

Wait, what?

Yeah, uh...

Oh, my God!

Uh, yeah, he...

Oh, my God!

You okay, babe?

No!

Oh, the...?

So you were...?

Well, then, um, KC, you should know that Winston's last words, right before the truck...

Oh. h*t him... were, um, "This is all KC's fault. And I wouldn't be d*ad if it wasn't for her."

(wailing)

Hah! (KC screams)

It's me and I'm alive!

He's alive!

Scared this dude.

I know.

Cece: Hmm...

Winston: Yeah.

What? What is going on?

Thank you for this, Cece. I needed this.

Yeah, you're welcome.

This means a lot.

Okay, but... Winston, I need you, I need you to go.

Hey, guy from the picture...

Mm-hmm if that's your real name... y'all look good together.

We out.

Cece: (chuckles) Bye.

Wait, who...?

I-I-I...

Oh, my God, that was so messed up.

You've changed my life, Cece.

Uh-huh.

The cycle is broken!

It's a whole new day.

From now on, the woman I'm in a relationship with is gonna be crying over me!

That shouldn't be the goal, though.

You know that, right?

I want some ice cream.

Never tell anyone we did this.

Can we get some ice cream?

Schmidt: Well, whose stuff is all this? Is Jess back?

Oh... (laughs)

Jess, what are you doing here?

Huh! Jess!

Hey, Brendan.

Cool vibe, Brendan.

Is this cute?

Mmm? Polka dots?

Or... don't go anywhere.

Yellow?

Mm-mm.

Wear the stripy one.

Hmm...

I think that will look nice with your face and everything.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's a good one.

That's nice.

Nick: You look pretty today.

Brandon: Thank you.





Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.

Please, I need you.

No, Nick.

It's a right and a privilege.

In South Africa, they don't even have juries.

They have a-a judge and two assessors.

God, I would have bullied you as a kid.

Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.

Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?

Yeah, I would.

I've turned in some memorable performances in the past.

But it's just one day... you'll be fine without me.

Now that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.

Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.

Ever since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.

When I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.

Not the same thing.

They're just boobs.

I promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.

She doesn't even live here.

She never signed our loft agreement.

She doesn't even know all the rules.

(laughing): Hi. Look at you.

You look so cute.

(chuckling): Thank you.

Cece: Love this top.

Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?

I know.

I've heard it four times this week.

So I take a hot glass out of the dishwasher, I pour cold water into it, then the customer picks up the glass, and the bottom falls off.

Oh, that's crazy.

For real?

Nick: He looks down, and he goes, like, (Italian accent): "Oh, my pants are wet."

(laughing)

I know, he-he needs to shape that story.

I don't know how you live with him.

He is the most obnoxious...

Winston: Knock it off. (indistinct arguing)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Stop. Stop it. Knock it off.

Jess, are you cool with me hanging this groundbreaking poster of dogs playing poker on the wall?

Jess, please tell him that he cannot hang this horrible painting.

I really have to go.

I think it's hilarious... they're playing poker.

Rather see a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger, mid-coitus.

Okay, now you're getting in your head again.

Both: Messy.

And we say things at the same...

The same...

See, you're getting in your head because you're going quieter.

Just go with your gut.

Don't.

Your ribcage has give.

You know, KC still hasn't texted me back.

I've been on five dates with her... five dates, and I still don't know where I stand.

New relationships are so hard!

They take so much work.

So much work. It's like... it's like making a risotto; a risotto in your heart.

Mm.

Oh.

Aw. What's that for?

Just 'cause.

Aw.

Mmm. How great is that?

So great.

Jess: So comfy, so warm.

Like a port in the storm.

I just want to skip all the first dates, and just get to this.

Mm-hmm.

You're gonna get there, okay?

You just got to... got to keep yourself open.

Wasn't Sadie gonna hook you up with, uh, that guy?

Oh, yeah, Fred. He invited me to watch a movie... at his house.

During the day.

Doesn't that make it sound like he's a boy who's allergic to everything?

You're looking for something wrong.

I got to say, she's right.

Mm-hmm.

And besides, what if he's got a dope-ass home theatre?

Damn!

This is a dope-ass home theatre.

(laughs)

I'm gonna h*t the bathroom real quick.

Okay. Well, hurry back before previews begin.

That was a joke, 'cause I feel like I'm in a real theatre here.

I mean, this is amazing. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me.

Oh, that was fast.

Hi. Didn't mean to startle.

Just wanted to know if you wanted some snacks during the movie.

I've just made a fresh pot of coffee.

We're Flip and Nancy.

Fred's parents.

Mm.

Oh. (laughs)

Fred lives with his parents.

Now I see where he gets his looks.

And his house. (laughs)

Guys, seriously.

I'm not... I'm not hungry.

You can't watch the movie on an empty stomach.

Hey, cool your jets until you have some of our coffee.

Beans are from Portland.

Oh, that's funny. (laughs) I'm from Portland.

Do you know my last book signing was at Powell's Books?

Oh, no way.

You're-you're a writer?

Well, I'm just a fool with a few stories.

Oh, you're just being modest.

And you are being lovely.

Oh!

(giggling)

You guys are so sweet together.

Flip: That's because we're still on our honeymoon.

35 wonderful years of marriage.

Feels like two to me.

Oh.

Nancy: Feels like one.

Flip: Like we just met.

Schmidt: Nick, what are we doing here?

Yeah. (laughter)

(clearing their throats)

Each-each of you know me.

Yeah.

If you don't, my name is Nicholas Miller.

I'm an American from Chicago.

I'm your new boss, so, you'll do what I say.

When the cave people went to the cave bar, and they asked for a drink on the rocks, they actually meant it. (laughs)

Now that we're all laughing...

It says, "Wait for laughs."

I...

Anybody have any questions?

I have a question.

Please. Anything.

Your mother.

(laughter)

Your mother. I love it.

Thank you for breaking the ice.

I know!

(laughter)

I must look so stupid.

"Hey, get over here. I got a meeting."

What an idiot, huh?

It was that bad, huh?

No, Birdman was bad.

This... this was a disaster.

I'm here to help you, okay? Look, I have over nearly ten years of experience in the corporate world.

What's "over nearly ten"?

"Nearly ten" would be eight or nine years.

I have... I have over nine years.

That's different, yeah.

Got you a tie. Corporate 101.

Dress better than your employees.

Reminds them that they're inferior.

I'd wear a tie, but only on my butt, like it were a tail.

A tail tie.

Furguson, you have a knot!

Is that salt water in here?

You been hanging down at the wharf again?

Guess what? I took a chance with that guy Fred, and I'm in love.

That's incredible.

With his parents, but I'm in love!

Furguson, clear my schedule.

I need a word with your sister.

When Nancy was in Zimbabwe building clean water systems, Flip dropped everything to go over there and be with her, and they put Fred in Tribal School.

You seem like you're on cocaine.

Yeah, right. Flip and Nancy and I hate drugs.

Okay, yeah, great. What do you like about Fred?

Well, I didn't really get any time with him, 'cause Flip and Nancy wanted to watch the sunset.

Hey, do not talk to me like I'm some bastard who doesn't enjoy a good sunset.

But if you really want to be in a relationship...

Then I have to get to know Fred. Ha! You know what?

Tomorrow, I'm gonna just cr*ck him open like a cold beer.

You know what's a good date?

Hmm?

Errands and a smoothie.

Okay, everyone, listen up.

Here are your new uniforms.

Oh, you got to be kidding.

Cece: Aah.

Save your groans for Birdman!

From now on, we will measure drinks.

Oh, man.

And we have a new one-napkin policy.

Just one napkin?

Questions at the end, please.

Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure?"

Nine times out of ten, they'll just back off and say "Thanks."

Now please go try on your new polos.

(all groaning)

Can I have a word with you?

Hey, Schmidt, everything you just said makes me want to give you a wedgie in front of the others.

You need to rule with an iron fist. No mercy.

You're not suggesting Cobra Kai rules?

I'm not doing it! They're my friends!

Your friends are gonna lose their jobs if this bar goes under.

Ooh! I never thought I would say this, but, give me the tie.

Now we're talking.

No mercy.

A corporate leader is born.

Don't-don't put it around your head.

Well, hello to you.

Hi. - Hi!

Fred'll be right down. You know, Nan and I are just packing up some books and paints for a park day!

A park day?!

Yes, it's from when we used to live in Paris.

You should come!

Well, look, um, I would love to, uh, but, um, I have to, uh, spend a little one-on-one time with, uh, this one.

When can chill with my parents.

Okay.

Yes!

Great!

Here's some paint.

Coffee?

I feel like I'm a car rental agent.

Yeah, well, you look like a prince.

Now, go. Go be a boss.

Hey, Cece.

Um, we measure our drinks now.

Am I right?

So, uh, do as I say.

(laughs) Of course. Use the thing.

Sorry, but, just, you know, it's important.

You know, with the... consist...

Is this the exact thing that you wanted to have happen?

I wouldn't want to get anything on my new uniform.

That's, like, six sh*ts.

So you have to charge...

That was some sass. You're at a real crossroads, so, you know, this is a big moment for you.

There is no fear in this dojo!

Nick: Hey, Javier?

Where's-where's your shirt?

Oh, it's so crazy, Nick.

Someone broke into my house last night and stole that ugly shirt.

(chuckles) Yeah...

I don't believe that.

Oh, it's boxy on me, dude.

As your boss... Javier, I need you to put your shirt on.

I need you to put it on... your mother.

(chuckles)

Hey, no mother jokes.

Javier, do not slide that right now, okay?

I mean it. Do not...

You're fired.

What?

Wha-What?

You changed, man.

That is some Jeffrey Tambor stuff, dude.

Javier, wait.

I-It's... Look, I wouldn't get...

Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You just fired Javier?

You are out of control, Miller.

I'm not gonna take it anymore, and you guys shouldn't, either.

So let's show management exactly what we think of their policies. Let's walk!

I'm sorry, bae, you're gonna have to keep it separate.

Totally get it. Love you, bae.

All right. Let's go.

That was bad.

But can we just take a moment to appreciate Cece?

I mean, the effect that she has on people... it's really incredible.

I can't believe... she's marrying me.

I mean... like, what?

Oh, boy, Furguson, this knot is getting worse.

(chuckles)

We are in a hairy situation, my friend.

(forced laughter)

Jess (laughing): I know! Really!

Oh, it's just, it's just you!

(laughing)

Jess: Hey, Winston.

This is Nancy and Flip and, um...

Hi! and, uh, we just went to the park, and we had a great park day, and we're gonna have Nice to see you. some, uh, wine before dinner.

Oh.

And it's gonna be awesome.

Oh, you should join us.

Yeah, come on!

Jess: You should join us.

A little sip.

You should.

Jess: Oh, yeah, for sure.

Definitely join us.

Join us.

Jess, a moment?

Jess, what the hell are you doing?

They're just the most amazing people I've ever met.

What happened to the one-on-one with Fred?

He's just so quiet... I can't get a read on him.

Jess... if you want a comfy, old relationship, you got to start somewhere.

All right? Go spend five minutes alone with him, now.

Go get some cheese for the wine.

Chevre is always nice.

But I wouldn't dare tell you how to buy cheese.

You're being so assertive right now... it's almost attractive.

Hey, not now. Not the time.

You know...

I can be shy sometimes, too.

You don't have to be shy.

Seriously, I-I-I'd really like to get to know you.

Really?

Here's something that I learned from our relationship.

When you feel a knot... you take a deep breath and you stare at it and face it without fear or judgment.

I don't think that it's Furgy's knot that's bothering you.

Ooh.

I think that the knot that's bothering you is right there.

(sighs)

Uh, wow, I, um...

I don't know where I stand with my girl, and I can't talk to her, because I am ashamed.

Aw...

Did he just say "ashamed"?

Yeah, that's what I said.

Ashamed... of being beautiful? Of being a man?

Of being passionate?

Hah! Then I'm ashamed, too.

I say to you... let her in.

(quietly): Yes.

All together now.

On the count of three? Oh.

Let her in.

No counting.

Let her in.

Okay, just go.

Fred: What a wonderful cheese store.

They had so many options.

That's good, 'cause I love cheese.

All kinds of cheese. Orange cheese, pizza cheese... I love all parts of pizzas, especially the dough.

Once I asked for a ball of dough, and they gave it to me and I took it to a park and ate it.

I'm so glad you opened up.

But then I realized I needed some sauce...

(laughter)

People always make fun of my eyes, but I guess they're...

Oh-ho! Good!

Winston, can I have a moment?

(quietly): Uh, yeah.

I love Flip and Nan.

I hate Fred.

No!

I know!

So Fred's not shy, he just sucks.

When I asked him what his favorite hobby was, he said, "Towels."

I've got to break up with that human pile of saltine dust.

I love Flip! I mean, Flip taught me how to be vulnerable with KC, you know?

Yeah.

Nancy ear-candled me.

I can hear for miles.

Their relationship's just such an inspiration, and I want to be around it, but what can we do?

We ditch Fred. Forget about that dude.

We establish our own relationships with Flip and Nancy.

Boom! Make future plans with just them.

"Future plans" is redundant, but other than that, I am on board!

Okay.

Now, I'm gonna need some alone time with Flip and Nancy.

Can you stall Fred?

Can I stall Fred?

Of course I can stall Fred.

I would do anything. I love Flip and Nancy.

Me, too! Are we totally crazy?

Maybe! I don't even care!

I don't even care, either.

Hm!

That's a vodka soda, I think. Uh, it's close enough.

I hear you! I'm getting to you! Stop yelling at me!

Shut up!

I don't understand what Cece's doing here.

She led the walk-out. If she's gonna be here, can she at least help us?

I am not gonna scab.

Sorry, bae, I cannot scab, but I'm here for you as your fiancé.

You are my rock right now. Do you need anything?

No, I'm good, babe. Okay, just let me know if you do. We are screwed!

Hey! Shut up! I'm trying my hardest!

I shouldn't have fired Javier.

I got to apologize. This is all my fault.

Obviously, this is your fault... everybody knows that... but a boss never apologizes; it shows weakness.

I feel like if Javier came back, the rest of the staff would come back.

That's a great idea.

I just said that.

Such a great idea.

Well, then give me one, because I said it first.

If you're giving it for that idea, if it's about that idea, then I deserve one.

But I don't want one.

And I felt left out.

(customers yelling angrily)

Shut up!

Well, I wonder what's taking them.

Probably just the traff. You know, the old 'ic.

(laughing)

"The old 'ic."

Anyway, I was thinking, um, is there anything you guys like to do that Fred doesn't like to do?

'Cause, like, I kind of just want to hang out with you guys and not Fred.

Hm.

Thank you for doing this, by the way. This is great.

Slow night. Just been... driving around, mouthing along to hip-hop songs.

You can go when I tell you to go.

Now, for your next test...

I want you to pretend you're about to break-dance, but do not actually break-dance.

Look, Javier, we've-we've come to give you an incredible opportunity: for you to apologize and get your job back.

So, what do you say?

(chuckles) Okay, uh, well, Javier, let me tell you something. Uh, I've been in the business world for just shy of half of two decades, and I can tell you that an opportunity like this does not come along often. So...

Your boss is extending his hand.

Schmidt, stop. Look, Javier, I'm sorry. I messed up.

Nick, don't apologize.

I've never been a boss before, and it's weird, man.

You're my friend, Javier.

Remember when your cousin was in town and-and my cousin was in town and we kissed each other's cousins and... then we peed on the ice maker?

Yes. I remember that fondly.

So rough.

Look, we both chose the bar over other stuff.

I-I could've been a lawyer, and-and you were a dentist.

Were you, really? You were gonna be a dentist?

Endodontist.

Look, it's my job to keep the bar open, but I still want it to be a great place to work.

If you come back, that'll be my top priority.

Imagine us as grandparents.

You think I haven't already?

You'll learn to love Fred.

And even better, you'll never have to go on a first date again.

Yeah. That sounds really good.

There's no rush. I mean, why don't we go up to the Vermont house in the next few weeks and all be together?

Vermont house?

Oh, yeah.

It's an 18th century farmhouse that we kind of refurbished.

Gah. Oh.

We send romantic notes on the clothesline.

Oh, my geez.

And a loom in the barn.

Nancy: You know, Fred, uh, Jess was just saying how much she likes model trains, right, Jess?

Fred: I didn't know you were a railie. That's so great.

Probably not a tabletop girl, right?

Do you do it costumed? Or do you just do it leisurely?

I deal mostly with the, uh, transitional era, post-Industrial Revolution.

We use horn hook couplers, so I'm kind of one of the best at scenery building. Uh, just finished this beautiful sanitation depot, made completely out of balsa.

I also was the first to implement wire-framed humans so that the people are poseable.

Station agent is now... Now he can bend his arm to say hello as the train passes.

It's a place for people.

Mm.

Maybe you should f*re me. What do you think?

You save enough money, buy me out one day, you run this place on your own.

You really think I could?

Yeah, definitely.

I mean, your dumb bitch of a mother sure could.

It's amazing, yeah. I own it myself.

Man (over P.A.): White zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.

(groaning)

What is going on?

Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.

Jess, I haven't told my mom that I'm getting married.

Okay.

Okay.

It's gonna be fine, 'cause...

I'm your maid of honor, and I will be there with you tonight every step of the way.

♪ 'Cause this is the Year of, of... ♪

Oh!

Oh, my God!

(screaming, grunting) Oh, Jess! Oh! Oh!

(gasps)

(grunting continues)

I'm fine.

Don't worry about me. The doctor said I'll be good as new in no time.

I know I don't look like somebody who should be questioning somebody else's judgment, but... maybe you should have told your mom you were getting married.

I know. I'm just so worried that she is not gonna like Schmidt.

And then she won't give us her blessing... which would k*ll me.

Oh, she'll love him when she meets him.

Schmidt is not exactly what my mom had imagined for me.

You know, she wanted someone maybe not so... white?

(laughs): Oh, he is so white.

Remember when the power went out, and we put him in the window to keep the planes away?

What is Schmidt gonna think when he finds out?

We are gonna get her blessing, or I'm not your maid of H.

Those stairs may have broken my body, but they did not break my spirit.

And with that, I rise.

Honey, you're not... You just need to... Yeah, relax. Okay.

You definitely can't go to this party.

(sighs) I got to go and tell him.

I got to go tell him before she gets there.

I'll call Nick, and I'll have him stall her.

Okay.

I don't think I can. You have no idea how anxious this woman is to get to the party.

No, no, no, I told you, we're not there yet.

You got to stay plugged in.

You're such a pill.

Well, just take her to the mall, get her some soft serve.

Be sure to save your receipts. I'll reimburse you from the party fund.

Got to go.

Mrs. Parikh, can you keep a secret?

I'm going to k*ll this soft serve nonsense.

(whimpers) You know what we're gonna do?

We're gonna play laser tag! (screaming)

(shouting in Hindi) What are you doing?!

We're gonna play laser tag!

It's a fun American game! It's a fun game!

Both: Groomsmen! Yeah. (whoops)


Mmm.

Ah. Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.

Now, who are you? I'm Groomsman Number Two.

(chuckles) Big Schmidt, Schmidt's cousin.

I'm Robby, Groomsman Number Four.

I am the ex-boyfriend of the bride, and a weirdly close friend of the groom.

I'm Number Five, J. Cronkite Valley-Forge.

CFO of Associated Strategies, LLC.

I'm 62 years of age, was recently widowed, and I believe earnestly that if we can all work together this wedding season, we will get more boom-boom than a TNT factory.

Yeah! (men laughing)

Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time.

I have a brief statement from G3, who could not make it here tonight.

It says, "Dear Jess, I can't fly in for every damn party.

"I will see you at... (imitates Coach): the wedding."

If you know Coach, that's exactly how he...

"Wedding."

Yeah, yeah.

And then he always goes, "Coach."

(laughs)

Now, me, myself, I am Winston Bishop.

Officer Winston Bishop?

The Winston Bishop? The Carport Hero?

I knew it was you. I saw you on TV, man.

Officer, you make me want to be a better man.

I'm gonna stop, uh, peeing in my ex-wife's mailbox.

Winston: No, seriously, everybody, calm down.

Act normal around me.

I'm a fun guy. I do pranks.

Uh, Cece's last wedding? The badger that fell down and almost k*lled a bunch of people... that was me!

(chuckles)

I'm Prank Sinatra, baby!

Old Brown Eyes.

Ain't no prank like a badger prank, because a badger prank got badgers, and it's dangerous as hell!

Ms. Parikh.

Who are you?

Oh. My goodness. Of course.

I must be completely unrecognizable to you from the countless photos you must have seen.

In honor of your visit, I stood the humble recipient of a professional shampoo.

So you're the man who's marrying my daughter?

Sure am.

No wonder she didn't tell me that she was engaged.

Oh.

Oh, no, then.

I'm assuming she was afraid I would disapprove.

But now that you've met me...

I disapprove.

Strong disapprove.

Let's take a moment to applaud your daughter's instincts.

No, no, no. Look, Schmidt. Mom.

I'm sorry. I can explain everything.

Presenting...

Cece's mom! (Schmidt groans)

Except for that.

I'm her mom.

You're her mom?

That's my mom.

Then who are you?!

Not her mom.

That's her mom!

A dumb little boy you are!

(phone ringing)

Yeah. Hello.

So, does Cece's mom love Schmidt, or what?

Which Cece's mom? The real one or the one I may have kidnapped?

Th-The real one?

(elevator bell dings)

Glen: Anything for Officer Bishop!

The Carport Hero!

Thanks, Glen. Sorry to army crawl into your home like that.

We come from a country of 400 million men.

Let's say half of them are no good.

Another half, very ugly.

That's still 100 million eligible men.

Sure, ten percent are gay.

Puts us at 90 million men.

Ms. Parikh, I love Cece.

Cut it in half again just for fun.

45 million men.

Cece, when were you gonna tell her?

I'm sorry.

On our wedding day when we were standing beneath our custom hybrid mandap-chuppah?

(crying): I'm so sorry. I just... I wanted the moment to be right.

I'm sorry.

(tires screech)

We meet again.

(shouting): Hello! Is anyone here?!

(horn honks fanfare)

Jess?

Winston! Oh, thank God!

I need your help.

Hey, Jess, let me ask you something.

Uh, I'm a fun guy, right? I mean, I have a way about me.

Winston, look at me, look around.

Does your thing seem important now?

You're the Carport Hero. Now I need your help.

No more Carport Hero!

Tonight, I'm Prank Sinatra.

No. No! You didn't play a prank...

You are the worst prankster in the world!

Every prank you do turns out either too big...

What is it?

Did you register me as a sex offender? (snickers) or too small.

How'd this blueberry get in here?

(mumbles): I don't...

(laughs)

(whoops)

You should have saw your face!

He did not see that coming.

Just like no one's gonna see what's coming tonight.

Nothing should be coming tonight.

I'm sorry, Jess.

The fuse has already been lit.

The lion has spotted the gazelle.

The doo-doo is already mid-flight to the fan.

The silly hounds have been released.

I repeat: the silly hounds have been released.

What did you d... You know what, never mind.

Just take me to Cece and Schmidt, please.

I did a prank. I did a... Oh.

(Winston grunting)

(grunting continues)

I hope the scooter fits in the elevator.

There's an elevator?

(speaking Hindi)

I'm trying to find out where to return you.

(speaking Hindi)

You have pepper spray?

Why didn't you use that on me?

(speaking Hindi angrily)

All right, I'll talk to you later.

Well, Cece's mom hates me.

Like Jay Z, I have 99 problems.

But unlike Jay Z, I have zero caveats.

I know, and I'm sorry.

Okay? I'm sorry I screwed up my easy job.

(speaking Hindi angrily)

And stop being so mean to me, or I swear to God I'm gonna fall in love with you!

(speaking Hindi angrily)

Where you going? Come back.

(sighs)

Let me make it up to you.

I know that I said I wanted the easy job.

But screw that.

I'm the best man, Schmidty.

I want the hard jobs.

I can handle it.

So what do we got? What do we need?

We're past hard at this point.

We're well into impossible.

It's an unfixable situa...

(horn honks fanfare)

Schmidt, I did not just drive 15 miles on a gout throne to watch you give up.

Especially not...

♪ In the Year... of Us. ♪

Look at yourself.

Look around us.

Maybe this isn't our year.

I have a plan.

And whatever it is, I'm in. I got this guy's back.

Don't think we actually need...

I know, but I'm in, is what I'm saying.

That... I mean...

♪ Whatever it is, I want in. ♪

Okay, whatever.

I want in.

Schmidt, how important is this to you?

Have I made that clear?

That I want to be, like, a third.

You can be in. You're in.

You're in.

Thanks.

That's all I wanted her to say.

Are you willing to do whatever it takes?

Of course.

I also didn't love the tone that, like, "I'm in, but who cares that I'm in?"

Jess (over speakers): Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention please?

Hello.

I'm Jessica Day.

I'm the maid of honor, but when I fell down the stairs, I wished I was made of rubber.

(laughs)

(man coughing quietly)

Uh...

This one goes out to the secret romantic in the audience.

Just a little reminder that love...

(chuckles) conquers all.

And without further ado, MaHotMoves Gandhi.

Follow me, follow me.

Follow me!

(upbeat Indian music playing)

(upbeat Indian music continues)

Think they're all really friends?

You know, I mean, when the dancing day is done?

(crowd cheering)

(upbeat Indian music continues)

(crowd laughing, cheering)

(upbeat Indian music continues)

(music ends, crowd cheering)

(whoops)

(Jess laughs)

Hey.

That was great.

Fantastic.

Wonderful.

Jess: Where'd she go?

Jess: Mrs. Parikh? Please, wait.

Stop. Look. (sighs)

It was my idea.

I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.

You really think a dance is all it takes?

Cece: Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.

Or what I imagined.

I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.

None of us did.

Quiet, Chair.

But I love him.

He makes me so happy, and I'm gonna marry him.

I will not give my blessing.

Cece, Schmidt...

(groaning): Oh, God.

Crunch. Ah...

sh**t me.

(sighs)

You have my blessing.

You have my blessing, too.

Mine, too.

Oh, come on, Not-Cece's mom.

That would've been awesome.

It was a natural three.

You got to finish.

We'll get her on board.

I promise.

Oh, she's gonna get hers.

No, no, Winston, no.

What did you do? No pranks.

Such bad timing.

Hey, Mrs. Parikh.

Check your shoe.

(Winston snickers)

Tickle foot! (laughs)

I put a feather in your shoe!

(laughing)

Too small, dude.

Way too small.

I've revised my vision.

Honey, without my mom's help, I don't think we can afford to parachute the rabbi in.

Well, that's why I've pared it down to only the things that matter.

That's great.

We can throw a wedding on a budget.

This is our year.

We can do anything.

Now, who's gonna take me to the john?

Not it!

Really?

You're the only girl here.

I can't. It hurts my back.

Who keeps giving her juice?

You're in a senility scooter; use a diaper!

♪ And it took a long time ♪

♪ To find you ♪

♪ But I finally found you. ♪

(laughs quietly)

That's a good tickle.

(laughs): Oh.

Easy, Winnie.





There he is.

Mr. New York. Mr. Broadway.

Happy last day.

I made you this.

Aw.

It's a bunch of pictures of you.

Well, I had to take the necessary precautions, because the last time you left, you forgot who I was.

You called me Jebecca.

Well, thank you so much, Jess. I really like it.

Cool.

Yeah.

Well, that's a kick in the shins.

Look, nothing personal, but, you know, I've moved a lot, so I have this system that I use.

Duffel bag full of essentials only.

And... one Jess cube.

You can't get rid of me.

Look, Jess, when I move, I make a clean break, okay?

I'm not going to get all sentimental.

And you promised you wouldn't make a big deal.

No, you're right, you're right. I promised you I wouldn't.

You did.

But... what about everyone else?

Showtime!

h*t it, Schmidt!

Huh?

Oh. ("New York, New York" plays)

Nick, where's your Donald Trump wig?

It's here.

Jess: Ugh.

This was not my vision.

I specifically said "dazzle."

You said "razzle-dazzle," and we said, "We don't want to do that."

Yeah, we told you this is not what he would want.

This isn't how men say good-bye.

(imitating Don Pardo): Live from New York, it's Coach's good-bye!

♪ Start spreading the news... ♪

Yeah, show's over.

We ain't doing this?

♪ I'm leaving today ♪
♪ I want to... ♪

Coach: The system works.

Remember, essentials only.

It's not just for packing; it's a way of life.

You want to move forward, you got to get rid of the past.

That means throw out all your junk...

Right...

Emotional junk, actual junk.

Got to make a clean break.

Clean break. That's right.

You're bl*wing my mind right now, Coach.

Doesn't even mean anything.

Or does it mean everything?

Jess: I cannot believe you're all buying into Coach's crazy system.

You guys have fun with your clean break.

I'm gonna go to my room, and I guess I'll have to cancel the horse and carriage that I hired to take you to the airport.

May and I are driving.

Jess: You are now.

You guys sure you're up for this?

I am ready for this. I'm single again.

I'm a new man. I'm leaving the past behind.

Nick: I want to get rid of my stuff, but all my stuff is really, really good, and I just can't get rid of it.

It's not, and you have to.

Everything you own is trash.

You're basically a hoarder.

Not true.

Everything has meaning.

Everything is connected to something else.

You need to be hard on yourself, okay?

Now, take this box and fill it up.

Okay...

Think I can do it?

Absolutely.

Okay. I'm gonna get hard and fix myself.

What?

That's not... No.

That's... I didn't... No.

Oh, here we go.

The Regis Philbin crepe pan.

Come on, Coach. You can't give this away.

Remember February 2014?

Or, as we like to call it, Crepe History Month.

Crepe History Month.

Winston: It was a hot winter's night.

We were drunk, but our judgment was on point.

Regis philbin (over tv): You hear that sizzle?

Let that sizzle speak!

Those pancakes are paper-thin.

There's only three left, so act fast.

This crepe pan... is a knockout!

Coach, we got to act fast.

We got to act fast.

We got to act fast!

They're so thin!

(both yelling)

You got to take the Rege, at least for the memories.

The Rege, man.

The Rege!

You know, I can't get rid of the Rege.

Can't get rid of the...

Psych!

I'm getting rid of the Rege.

Memories are nonessential, all right?

That's what makes the system work.

I found an ant farm full of candy wrappers.

Is this essential?

Like, really, what do you think?

Hmm? I need you to get harder, Nick.

Can you get harder for me?

What?

Do you need me to get hard with you?

I feel like you're not... meaning to say what you're saying.

Talking about cleaning up.

Schmidt, I think you forgot about this box.

Oh, oh, that's cool. Thanks, man.

I appreciate it.

Oh... you got a Cece box.

So what? It's not like everybody hasn't seen your Phylicia Rashad box.

No, you hav... You have?

Birthday card...

Don't... please don't go in the Cece box. Don't do... a crude drawing of... you and Cece and your mixed-race child.

Yes, I painted that.

Ooh, five dollars! Come to daddy.

This five dollars belongs in the box.

It's from the night that I first met Cece.

Looks like it's finally just the two of us, huh?

Oh, God, you're about to say something stupid, aren't you?

Yeah.

Girl...

And then I said something stupid, and Cece made me put money in the douche bag jar.

What'd you say? You say you can flex your butt cheeks like pecs?

I bet you were all like, "You're making my dong go crazy!"

Winston: I bet he said something chauvinistic...

(laughs) ...that comes from insecurity but ultimately leads to something endearing.

You know, it doesn't matter what I said.

Nonessential, right?

Exactly.

So, good-bye, Cece.

May some poor street urchin with a perfect 34-D enjoy the sports bra that you left in my car.

Winston: We got to tell Schmidt that Cece is in love with him.

Right now, he is out there throwing away all of his Cece mementos, acting like he's just going to move on.

Jess, I cannot watch this when I know what I know.

I know.

We got to tell him.

I promised her I wouldn't get involved.

I always meddle. I've learned my lesson.

She's trying to get Schmidt out of her system, and we have to support her, even if it means letting her climb a mountain with no prior knowledge or experience.

Yeah, but does she know that Schmidt and Fawn broke up?

Is she getting our voice mails?

I don't know. She hasn't called me back.

Maybe there's no reception on the top of Mount Shasta.

(snaps fingers) We try again.

Hey, Cece, it's Je...

Hey, yo, Ceec, what up, fam?

It's your girl Winston, aka Winnie the Bish, aka-ak-aka Brown Lightning.

Schmidt dropped Fawn like a bad habit, okay, so ain't nobody riding g*n.

So you better get on while the getting is good.

You got it?

I hate that you're so good at this.

I was so nervous.

Look at all this crap.

Look at this.

"Associated Strategies."

"Ass Strat." What a joke.

More like "Butt Strat." This place is total butt.

Hey, Jess, it's our sex mug.

What?

What?

Oh... nothing.

It's just a mug that Nick and I used for sex.

Oh, gross. Like, in it?

Ew! What?

No. No, we used it when we were dating.

It was hard to find times to be intimate with everyone around, so we needed to come up with a code.

Just a way to let each other know we were aroused without arousing suspicion.

That's wordplay.

It's also a free writing lesson.

Jess: When one of us left the mug on the entryway table...

"Ass" out meant it was time to...

Make love...

Bone.

Yeah, make love.

We're getting rid of this thing... especially since you guys aren't using it anymore, right?

Nick and jess: Right.

Wrong.

I, Winston L'Andre Bishop, saw that very mug on this very hallway table just last week...

"Ass" very out.

Ooh...!

Jess: Winston, that mug hasn't seen any action in over a year.

You're off your rocker.

If I were off my rocker, would I take a weekly selfie with my cat?

Oh, Winston.

You see, just last week, I took this selfie with...

(chuckling): Wait, not that one.

(Winston laughing)

That's crazy. Not that one. I forgot I had this one.

This selfie, in front of that table.

Sex mug. Question is, who put the mug out?

All right, let's not play the "who put the mug out" game.

We should be focusing on Coach.

I saw you checking out Jess's butt last week.

No.

Yes, she was wearing the "look at me" skirt.

All right, well, let's not try to...

My money's on Jess.

Wait.

She hasn't had sex since Ryan, and desperate times call for Nick Miller.

Is the "look at me" skirt the green one?

Hey. Do not change the subject.

You are implicating yourself by changing the subject like that.

Hey!

I put the mug out.

Okay? And, actually, nothing happened, and I regret nothing.

Now, I'm going to my room, and I'm considering throwing out my sunglasses.

So long, old friend.

(sighs)

Just doesn't feel right.

(chuckles): Welcome back, old friend.

(knocks) Hey.

Got a second?

Jess, we don't have to talk about it.

Obviously, I was the one who put the mug out, so I wanted to thank you for covering for me.

No problem.

Obviously, we're broken up, and it was... a moment of weakness.

I didn't even know you put it out; I didn't see it.

Oh!

No harm, no foul.

Well...

We didn't bone.

No bone, no phone home.

Great. So we're cool.

I'm cool if you're cool.

Fanterstic.

I'm going to knit a scarf for Coach.

I'm sure he'll love it.

Okay, bye.

Thanks for the chat.

Sayonara.

Hey, Nick, uh, do you want to know why I put the mug out?

We're cool!

We're cool.

Go knit that scarf.

Right.

(door closes)

(whispers): Okay.

No, no, no! Cece!

I want it back! I want it back!

Pop, pop, little bubble!

Let that sizzle speak.

It's time to flip. Care to do the honors?

Ah, sure, man. That'd be cool.

Rude.

Winston, you're not gonna trick me into taking the stupid pan.

It stays behind... that's the system!

Clean break.

You know what, fine, Coach, don't take it with you.

Leave everything behind.

Try not to remember anyone.

We are nonessential.

Message received.

Nah, Coach, I don't think so.

Because this crepe belongs in the belly of someone with a heart.

(sighs)

Damn it!

Ouch!

(groans)

Why are you so secure?

You're filled with things that nobody wants!

Oh. Thank God.


Hey, how are you?

I dropped something in the bin, and I need it back.

You Jewish?

I just need a bo... I just need a box.

I just can't part with you.

Okay, I'll tell you what happened.

You knit fast.

Winston had fallen asleep polishing his candelabra.

I had just opened a bottle of pink wine, and then you showed up.

Nick: Oh, hey.

Just working out.

Got to sweep the temple.

♪ ♪

(groaning, growling)

Damn...

So, see, it wasn't my fault.

In your defense, I've been working on my body, doing my burpees, and it shows.

(knees crackling)

(knees crackle)

(winded): I'm not gonna do that again.

Nick...

Warrior pose!

Nick, is there anything that I do that makes you think about putting the mug out?

No, I-I can't think of anything.

Right.

It's just not the way that this old brain works.

Clean break.

Great. Clean break. I agree.

Jess, hold on. Hey, hey... H-How is that...?

Jess, wait!

Yeah, I'm stuck.

Well, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.

How do I know this is your box?

Do you have any identification, "Cece"?

Cece's my ex-girlfriend; it's a box of her things.

But I can tell you everything that's in there.

There's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.

Why would you have her brassiere?

Well, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.

She never asked for it back?

Okay, um, Wally, look, it's a box of memories.

Memories that I'm not ready to let go of yet.

Maybe if I could talk to Cece...

Can't talk to Cece; Cece's on top of a mountain.

Look, I know this is unusual, but I need that box back, Wally.

I need it back more than anything else I've ever needed in my life.

Please.

Does she know she's on the mountain, or is she being held there against her will?

Damn it, Wally, give me the box!

No! No!

No! No!

(whistle bl*wing)

Wally!

Stop bl*wing the whistle!

You're sexually safe!

Coach, is that a bigger bag?

My old bag broke, so I got a wheelie.

Same system.

Still only essentials.

(pan clangs)

Is there a pan in there?

Nah. Nah, that's not a pan.

That was just, uh, the sound of two track pants hitting together.

You know, the buttons be like... ting... ti...

But, um... (clears throat)

Yeah, since I got this new suitcase, I might as well take a few more things.

Just to fill up space. Know what I mean?

Just to fill up space.

Like, uh... take these glass grapes.

Just to fill up space.

Not that I want them.

Of course not.

And this blanket.

For cushioning.

(moans)

That smells nice, huh?

For cushioning, dude.

These mystery novels.

Take these.

Not 'cause they're Jess's, just because...

I'm an avid reader now.

Stop smiling at me, man.

I'm taking Nick's workout jams.

'Cause, uh... that one time I trained him, (voice breaking): saw a lot of results.

(voice breaking): I remember. He was so fat.

And I'm taking this remote.

Because you always h*t the info button by mistake.

No, no, it's not by mistake, Coach.

(sobbing softly)

I like to know more about the cast and crew.

Remote's gonna miss this TV so much.

Our TV is gonna miss that remote.

(sobs)

(sniffs)

Smells like all our fingers.

(both sobbing)

(wailing)

Hey, Jess.

Hey.

Do you really think I haven't thought about putting this mug out?

Oh, I don't know, Nick. You said it.

What's past is past. Clean break.

Think about my living conditions for the past year.

I live across the hall from my beautiful ex-girlfriend.

And your living conditions... you live across the hall from your beautiful ex-boyfriend.

Two true beauties.

So you have thought about it.

I'm a man.

I am a human man.

Interesting.

You're the one who's always getting out of that shower in that little towel, Jess.

Or you're wearing your glitter or your pantyhose.

They're driving me crazy! Okay?

I know how hard it is to get those pantyhose up, and I just... I just sometimes want to rip 'em down.

Just admit it, Miller!

You're thinking about putting the mug down right now!

No.

Admit that you want me to be thinking about it.

I don't want you to think about it, so stop thinking about it.

Well stop talking about it and then I'll stop thinking about it.

So, you are thinking about it?

Look, Jess!

I'm not not... thinking about it.

(door opens)

Hey, guys. Want to know what happened to me today?

Jess and nick: We're kind of in the middle of something...

Fine, I'll tell you.

I spent $500 to get back a five dollar bill.

Go ahead, call me a fool.

You won't be the first person to call me that today.

You're a fool!

I need to move on.

I'm never gonna get Cece back.

And I know it's my fault that I lost her.

Nick: You lost her twice.

You had her...

I know I lost her twice.

Why would you have to...?

Then you got her, then you blew it.

Then you got her...

Who are you clarifying this for?

Are you sure you know how Cece feels about you?

Yeah, I mean, she said a thousand times that she only wants to be friends with me.

Schmidt...

Jess, Cece doesn't love me and she never will.

So I think it's time to let go.

Nick, I want you to have this five dollars.

What?

Go buy yourself something special, like a burrito.

I love burritos.

Oh, I have to tell you something, Schmidt!

I... (groans)

But I can't tell you.

(groans) So, I'll...

I'll tell you. Loophole!

Nick...

Cece's in love with Schmidt.

What?

(sighs) Yeah.

For real?

Well...

Also, Winston promised...

Why are we talking about Winston?!

Winston...

Cece loves me! Nick, we did it!

I got to go!

Can't wait for Cece to get back from her trip.

I'm going after her. Coach... (sighs)

I used to wish that you were uglier.

I don't wish that anymore.

I only wish you the best.

Hey, you're the handsome one in the loft now.

Big responsibility, but I think you're ready.

All right, you guys, I'm off.

Off to climb a mountain.

I'll see you in autumn.

Winter at the latest.

Good luck, Schmidt.

Yeah.

You go get her!

Okay.

Coach: Find that girl.

Winston: See you, Schmidt!

Jess: Bye!

Cece!

Cece.

Hey, um... so, I was, I was on the top of this mountain, and I finally got cell reception and there were, like, 20 voice mails from...

Are you in love with me?

Because I'm in love with you.

Deeply.

But I assumed that you would never because I've...

I've messed this up so many times.

And you've made it very clear that you just want to be friends with me and I value that friendship so much.

So if I'm ruining it by doing any of this, please, please stop me!

Schmidt.

I'm in...

I'm in love with you.

(quietly cheering)

Really?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's kind of stupid how much I'm in love with you.

You should've seen how fast I came down that mountain.

I mean, a lot of it was falling.

Luckily, the ground just stopped me, but...

You remember this?

Looks like it's finally just the two of us, huh?

Oh, God, you're about to say something stupid, aren't you?

Yeah.

Girl, I'm-a marry you.

Jar.

I know this might seem crazy, uh, and... probably a little bit impulsive, but it's not.

Not for me.

I've known since the minute that I met you.

(gasps) Oh, my God.

Cecelia Parikh...

Oh, God, you're gonna say something stupid, aren't you?

Girl, will you marry me?

(all gasping, screaming, laughing)

Would you please shut up?! I can't hear the answer!

Oh. Shh. Yeah.

Yes!

(all cheering)

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

We're getting married!

(all cheering)

(chattering happily) We did it!

Go say bye.

Uh...

I love you guys and, uh...

I'm gonna miss you.

Especially you, Jebecca.

Aw.

(all laugh)

All right, man.

All right! Aw.

We're gonna miss you.

Bye, buddy.

Good-bye, Coach.

See you, man.

See you, Coach!

Save the date! Bye!

Bye!

Bye!

Don't ever change, Coach.

See you at the wedding!

He's gonna change.

Nick: Later!

Jess: Bye!

Winston: See you, buddy!

Schmidt: See you!

Adios.

Clean break?

Clean... break.

Actually, do you mind talking with me for, like, ten minutes?

Cece and Schmidt are in my room.

Oh, sure. (crying nearby)

Oh, Cece's crying.

Aw.

Aw.

(high-pitched crying)

I can't believe this is happening.

It's everything that I've ever wanted.

Okay, I know. Me, too.

But... we can't have sex if you keep crying.

I'm gonna stop.

Great.

I'm gonna stop.

Great!

(speaking indistinctly)

(whispering): Coach and May are fighting. We don't want to disturb them.

They're not fighting.

I know how to read body language. Look.

Her arms are crossed in a position of dominance, and he's playing his forehead like a piano.

Winston: Will you clowns focus?

My waffle is in the toaster, and if I wait too long after it pops, it'll get hard.

Look, I know about relationships.

Winston can vouch for me.

That girl, KC, just texted him,

"What's up?"

That riddler.

So I had him text back an empty bubble.

Is he thinking about her? Or is a baby playing with the phone?

She don't know, but she want to know.

There she is. There she is.

Oh.

Jess: Hey.

Morning.

Hello. - How do?

Hey. Oh, someone left a waffle in the toaster.

Bye, guys.

Man, this waffle had better be hot or I am going Durst on y'all.

Hey...

Coach.

Why...

Jess, are you talking like that?

She thinks you and May are fighting.

No, we're not fighting.

(chuckles)

We did break up, though.

(gasps) Oh, my God, I knew it.

I mean, I'm so sorry. What happened?

May accepted a job in New York as a section musician for the Met.

Oh, has Alan taken a liking to her? Oh, bravo.

Good for... You know, I've always been a fan of his.

When he conducted, uh, Das Rheingold with the Royal Stockholm Orchestra, it was magnificent.

Jar or slap?

I don't have any cash on me.

Good slap.

Jess: Are you okay?

Do you want to talk about it?

No, I'm good. Yeah. I'll miss her, but... we're still friends. We're cool.

I'm cool.

Cool.

Nick: All right.

He is not good.

Winston, get back here! We need to powwow about May and Coach!

Winnie's gonna need a minute.

What are you reading? What is...

One Woman's Journey Up Inside Herself?

It's really inspiring. I actually want to be the woman in this book.

"Finding inner strength in a time of crises."

Cece, are you in crises?

I'm fine. Cece's fine.

How are you? How's Fawn holding up?

If you must know, my paramour Councilwoman Fawn Moscato has been so strong since the incident.

(indistinct chatter)

You know, reporters are calling it Panty-Gate.

There's pictures of her naked lady-bottom all over the Internet. Sid, put the phone away.

You picked it up right when I said "naked lady-bottom."

Please. You guys are good, then?

You know, 'cause the last time we spoke, you said you were feeling a little, you know, used.

Well, not anymore. We're a team now.

Fawn and Schmidt.

Fawmidt.

Vomit?

No, Fawmidt.

You're saying the word "vomit."

No, I don't hear that, but okay.

Fawn's holding a press conference later today, and I don't mean to toot my own shofar, but I'll be standing there right by her side.

So this scandal is actually bringing you two closer together.

Team Fawmidt has never been stronger.

I heard it there.

Wow, that sounds exactly like "vomit."

That's a problem.

Mm-hmm.

"Roughly the same length as The Pearl."

How is that a pull quote?

And that... is how babies get made.

It's gross, right?

How does the sperm find the egg?

Propelled by its tail, the sperm travels up the canal until it reaches the egg.

Now, for us, it's only a couple of inches, but for Mr. Sperm there it's miles away.

Miles and miles and miles away.

(sighs) It's almost like... why would the egg want to be so far away from the sperm?

You know? Like, didn't the egg and the sperm have a great time together?

And then you're just gonna pack your bags and leave and go to New York?

To play music with some other sperm.

You're just-just gonna leave? You're gonna leave your sperm and go play music with other sperms?

And I'm cool with that! I'm cool with that!

You know, I got eggs. I have eggs on deck!

This sperm got swag. All those other sperms ain't got swag like me. Can any other sperm sport this much green and still look dope? No!

That ain't tight! This is tight!

This is tight!

(crying): I just want you to come back, and I... (sniffles)

I guess I chose the wrong day to observe Health.

Coach (crying): I miss her!

May.

Listen, thanks for standing next to me up there, Ponyboy.

I hope this show of remorse will keep these reporters off my back.

Oh, I know it will. And then, you know what, once this is over, maybe we get out of here for a little bit. Lay low, - Oh.

Rent a cabin in the woods, Yeah.

Read some poetry, have horizontal sex.

Okay, two of those three things sound like fun. Now, here's your statement in case you're asked any questions.

Oh, a st...

I'm not gonna need a statement. I'm a seasoned improviser.

Hey, guys. We're the Belly Laughs.

So, I need a location.

Boy: How 'bout fat camp?

(laughter)

That's adorable. But just, please, read what I wrote.

I will. But I'm not gonna do it until I get out there.

You're gonna want me in the moment for this.

Okay.

(reporters clamoring)

Good afternoon.

Um, before I answer any of your questions, my partner would like to read a statement.

Honey.

I am a sick man.

On Saturday last, Councilwoman Moscato was caught not wearing underpants because I...

I asked her not to wear them.

Why?

Because it turns me on.

What I did was wrong. I'm so sorry, Fawn.

I'm sorry, Los Angeles.

And I'm sorry to the man upstairs, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Dress shirts on a Monday?

You know how it is.

Coach breaks up with a lady, we take him out, and he gets loaded.

Yeah, I know how it usually goes when Coach breaks up with a girl, but May is different.

Sometimes she comes over and they don't even have sex.

I don't get that.

Trust me, I am right about this, just like I was right about them fighting.

I'm on, like, a streak here. I might just be... an expert in love. Like a... you know, like a love doctor, if you will.

I will not. You are the least qualified person to call themselves a doctor of love.

Exhibit "A": you dated me.

I rest my case. (chuckles)

Court is adjourned.

Guilty as charged.

(laughs)

Put... I would stop that.

Case... rested. Listen, I got to say I agree with Nick on this one, Jess.

I mean, it's been a whole day, and KC still hasn't texted me.

Well, that's just proof that the bubble is working.

Look, you guys, Coach needs to talk to May.

Trust me. He is in pain.

I'm happy and I'm healthy and I'm ready to party!

(laughs) Let's get drunk! (laughing)

(whoops) You're wrong.

Coach. (chuckles) (Coach grunts)

Do you want to talk about what happened today or...

Talk about what?

No. (chuckles)

(Nick and Winston laugh) Hey, um, actually, can you do me a favor?

May's gonna be recording later.

She's gonna stop by and pick up her rubber circle.

May has a diaphragm?

No, it's the thing that you put on the floor to s*ab the cello.

Condom.

No.

No, it's the thing you put on the floor to make sure the cello stays put.

Cello s*ab.

Oh, yeah. Cello s*ab.

Oh. Well, wouldn't you like to be here when she comes by?

No, that's gonna be hella weird. I want to party!

(laughs) Yeah!

(indistinct cheering)

I'm gonna do this and gonna do this, this, this, this, this.

(sighs)

What was that speech?

I'm sorry, okay? I told you to read the statement beforehand and then you told me that terrifying story about doing improv at a fat person's camp.

I didn't know that the statement was gonna blame me for Panty-Gate.

And by the way, for your information, the Belly Laughs did not "do" improv. We reinvented it.

I know you must be embarrassed, but... you saved me.

Yeah, well, people think I'm a sicko now.

One of your aides spit at me.

Was it Shallon? Yeah, that's a lisp, but still, he's fired. Look, if you want to leave, I completely understand.

But the truth is...

I can't do this without you.

Well, now Ponyboy is feeling very conflicted.

Just one last photo op.

You and I having a lovely evening.

Show the press everything's back to normal.

And then I promise it'll just all be about us.

Could we do horizontal sex?

Yes.

With foreplay?

It's a deal-b... It's a deal-breaker. It's a - Uh... Yeah.

Deal-breaker. Okay.

Fine, yes, fine, yes.

Oh, God.

No, please. Oh...

Oh, God.

(knocking) May.

Cece!

So Coach a May broke up?

Long story short, they shouldn't have broken up and I am the only person that sees this. I realize I'm kind of an expert in love.

A love doctor if you will.

Where are your crackers?

A-Above the fridge.

Cece, did they raise your tuition again?

Why are you so hungry?

I've decided I'm going to climb Mount Shasta.

By yourself?

I'm leaving for three weeks. I want to like the woman in the book, I want to go on a climbing trip and find myself.

Okay, um... Ceec, are you sure you're ready for a climbing trip?

Jess, I just... I can't sit here and watch Schmidt with Fawn.

And I don't think they're breaking up any time soon, so...

Cece, they're never gonna last. He doesn't really love her.

Did he tell you that?

No, but... as a doctor of love, I sense these things.

(knocking)

The Love Doctor just knows.

May.

Hi.

Uh, I'm here for my endpin anchor.

Yeah.

Ah, thank you.

Very sorry to hear about the breakup. Are you okay?

Um, yeah. Yeah.

I'm here to talk if you ever need to. In hard times, it's nice to have a friend, May.

Thanks... Jess.

Right?

Yes.

Well, uh...

I'm in the middle of a recording session.

I got to get back to the studio, so... see ya.

Bye.

Yeah, Jess, she looks real broken up about it.


(knocking)

I... I'm a mess.

I know!

(crying)

(whispers): The doctor is in.

Wait, what?

Nothing. Cry it out.

Mmm! Ah.

Wow.

I have never seen Coach go this hard after a breakup, man.

You sure he's okay?

It's good, it's good, it's good.

You treat an outside wound with rubbing alcohol, you treat an inside wound with drinking alcohol.

That's science.

I feel that, man.

It is time to turn things up.

Sidney...

Do what you do! (chuckles)

("Black Velvet" by Alannah Myles begins playing)

Aw... (short chuckle)

This is my jam.

Y: We've only been dating for a few months. I just thought that... that breaking up was, like, the smart thing to do, you know?

I know you're upset, sweetie, but I... I can't understand anything you're saying with the crackers.

Do you love him?

I think I do.

Well, then, maybe moving to New York doesn't mean you have to break up.

(muffled): So you think that I should... that I should ask Coach to move with me?

Okay, how about we put down the crackers?

I think she wants Coach to move to New York with her.

Oh! Yes, yes!

I mean...

Yeah? You-You... You think that he would say yeah?

Yeah. Definitely. He's crazy about you. He had a meltdown today in health class.

Now, the kids did learn that sex is emotionally complicated, so it was a good class, but trust me...

What Jess is trying to say here is that if you... if you really know how you feel about someone, you need to act now.

Wow. (laughs) Am I really doing this?

Yeah, but not before we clean your face,

'cause it's caked in snot.

Winston: Ooh, yeah, Coach!

Who you think he's gonna hook up with?

It's a tough Monday crowd. It...

It's nearly impossible to say, but I'm gonna go with the white bodysuit and, uh, the leopard print leggings.

She looks smart to me.

Winston: No way. No way. money's on the one with the wedding ring whose husband is clearly over there in the corner spying on her.

Yeah, he's not happy about that.

Oh, oh, ooh! Dora the Explorer just entered the scene (laughs)

You're tiny. I like it.

Nick: There she g... Oh! For the kiss!

Oh!

The winner, the winner.

Oh. May's here. Coach.

(grunting, growling)

(both whistling, grunting)

May here, she here.

Wh-Wha... Uh, May, wh-what are... what are you doing here?

No, come on.

No, no... ♪ In a flash ♪
♪ He is gone ♪
♪ It happened so soon... ♪

In case you were wondering, she, uh, she did get her little rubber holder thing.

Coach, um, I wanted to apologize.

Not now, honey.

He needs some time, honey.

I brought over a beer.

We'll take that beer.

Give us that beer, honey.

Sorry.

I'm not a freaking love doctor.

I'm Dr. E.D. Ote.

(chuckles) Dr. Idiot.

Yeah, I get it. I just never understood the whole love doctor thing, anyway.

I guess I was just hoping that with all the mistakes I've made, at least I could help you guys find love.

That I didn't go through all that for no reason.

Yeah, but no one has the answers, you know?

It's love, it makes no sense. It's messy.

There's no such thing as a love doctor.

You know what, Cece?

Go on your trip. Go get over Schmidt.

Don't listen to me.

I'm gonna climb that mountain.

Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

But I'm not gonna do it for Schmidt, I'm gonna do it for me.

Good. Go.

I love you, girl.

Love you, too.

Hey, don't smile. Don't smile. Look sadder that you're buying underpants. Underpants make you very, very sad.

Oh, I hate being here so much.

These underpants make me so uncomfortable.

That's perfect. There's that fat boy improv training.

Now, next, I'm going to ask for something with a little more coverage. You're gonna flip out, say you can't take it anymore, and leave the store. Then tomorrow we enter you into some kind of rehab facility.

When you get out we'll announce that we're getting married.

Married? What? I don't...

Shh. Yes. Shh. Yes, yes. Okay, so what I say is we build on this momentum, okay?

And we get married. I know it's not the most romantic idea in the world, but we'd be happy.

And then, we play our cards right, you and I are living in the mayor's mansion by 2020.

Fawn. Fawn.

No.

No? Oh, n-no to some of it?

No to all of it. We can't get married. I barely even know you.

You... You know me.

The real you, Fawn.

This is the real me.

I'm a politician, not in The vag*na Monologues.

I mean, what do you want?

I can get you anything you want.

You'll be rich, I'll be powerful.

I'm realizing... just now that it's not what I want.

I don't want any of that.

I want to be in love.

I want to be... I want to be crazy in love.

Okay, well, certainly don't quote Beyoncé and then pretend like you just thought of it.

Uh, uh, I want to be drunk in love.

But that's also a Beyoncé lyric.

Come on, Fawn.

You're not really in love with me.

I'm not really in love with-with you.

We just look great together buying underpants.

Are you breaking up with me?

I guess I kind of am.

Well, um...

I don't want this to come out the wrong way, but... does this mean I lose your vote?

(chuckles)

Never.

(camera shutters clicking)

(shouting): I just can't stand to be in here any longer!

Surrounded... by these underpants!

Red ones and yellow ones and blue ones and pink ones!

And this woman with her brassiere/teddy.

Underpants everywhere! They're driving me nuts!

I feel like I got underpants all over my body!

Schmidt out. This is ridiculous.

Enough is enough. Get out of here, paparazzi.

No, leave me... Get-get out of my way, sir.

I just want to say something.

No.

And then I'll leave.

Look, I'll never get involved in your personal life ever again.

Okay? Because I have no idea what I'm talking about.

And I know that now.

You could just... you could just troll for basic bitches at the juice bar, and I will say, mm, nothing.

Okay? So, look, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

I do love her.

I'm crazy about her.

Yes! I was right!

(laughs) Love Doctor! I'm back.

Really? I thought it was just a regular break-up.

But in all fairness, I hadn't thought about it that hard.

I mean, what do I do, man?

You know, it's like she's going to New York.

Yup.

I can't go to New York with her. That's crazy.

You know? I like my sun on the right and my ocean on the left.

It's a rule of mine.

Plus, I'd have to leave you guys.

Can't leave you guys, I mean, I finally have a home.

All right, flash forward to the future.

40, 50 years.

You're married. Kids, grandkids.

Mm-hmm.

I'm long d*ad.

Naturally.

Of course.

And you look over to the woman sitting next to you.

And she's gray.

She's old.

She has that, like, grandma smell.

You have a grandpa smell, but you got...

Grandmas always smell like... like right when you open a cupboard.

Yeah, she has that smell, but...

Mm-hmm.

You love her.

Be honest with yourself.

Is that fat old lady sitting beside you...

Mm...

Honestly, right now, in my head, I'm just picturing, like, a beanbag chair with a wig on it.

Okay. We have gone too much into the description.

Okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Is that May?

I think so.

Well, that's big.

Let's go get her.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Whoo-hoo!

Let's go get May. - Yeah.

Hey, Jess, she texted me back! The blank bubble worked!

Guys?

Have you seen my white friends?

In 40 years, when we're old and Do it.

A mess of fat, loose skin hanging, I have boobs, and you've got hair on your face...

Holding my rock sack while I'm sitting on the toilet so it doesn't fall in the water.

What are you saying?

I'm saying, as you get older, your testicles lengthen.

(scoffs) No, what I'm saying is I love you.

Oh.

And that I would be a fool if I let you leave to New York without even fighting for us.

Ernie...

I love you, too, but I... I can't stay here.

I don't want you to stay here.

Um... look, I know we haven't been dating that long, and, um, this might seem crazy, but I was won...

Will you move to New York with me?

Yes! That! That's what I...

Yes?!

Yeah, that's what I wanted to do, yeah.

(screeches) Right. So, we're moving to New York?

We're moving to New York.

We're moving to New York.

Jersey City.

What?

Jersey City!

Jersey... I don't...

Nick: Well, this is all you, Jess.

Come on. This is all you.

I mean it. If Coach were hanging out with me, we'd be b*ating up a priest right now. (laughs)

You had a lot to do with this, too.

No, really. All that stuff about "Who do you see yourself next to?"

That's-that's really good.

Do you do that?

Who-who do you see yourself next to?

Winston mostly.

Ah. Yeah, me, too, actually.

(both laugh)

I just see a really old Winston.

(laughter)

Eating handfuls of birdseed out of the bag.

(both chuckle) He gets really into birds.

Hey!

Play some music! Play some music!

(playing upbeat, romantic classical music)

I'm sorry about Fawn.

Yeah. Sorry buddy.

Yeah, you guys were good together.

She was fine.

Okay, that's enough. I know you guys didn't like her.

Hated her guts.

So much...

Wait. What are we watching right now?

That girl just *** her boobs out Nick, why are you watching smut?

It was right there in the DVD player. I don't wanna get up and get it.

***

Who leaves p*rn on the DVD player.

I don't think we'll use it ***. Might as well just leave it in.

I'm sleeping on the couch. Fergusson and I are fighting.

***

It's a good story. Let's just watch and sees what happen.

What are you smiling at?

Nothing.

For crying out loud.

***

Jess. I have to see how the story ends.

There isn't any plot.

***





Okay, Schmidt, you ready for your feedback for the week?

Yes. Uh, let me just pull up my performance grid.

First off, thanks for keeping sex quick.

You were like a dog with an ice cream cone, and I loved it, but screaming "that's how Schmidty do" was not ideal.

Even though that's how Sch-Schmidty did?

Well, Schmidty did, and he did it good, but mommy doesn't want to hear how Schmidty's doing.

Note... note taken.

Okay. Great. Good.

Note taken.

I feel like I'm watching a p*rn set in an HR department.

You know, Fawn is teaching me how to be the most effective and successful man and lover I possibly can be.

Really? I thought you were fine before.

When you two were together? Which time?

The... the first time or the third time?

Because... 'cause you two were very off-and-on.

In a... in a very confusing way.

(laughs) I've had sex with him so many times.

We have a fun thing together, don't we?

Super fun, yeah. I really enjoy it.

What is her... what is it, Cecil?

What is your name?

You'll learn it. Don't worry.

Fawn's helping me see that I haven't reached my full potential yet.

Well, obviously, none of you have.

No, I have. I'm a cop.

And, as of yesterday, my mom no longer buys my plane tickets, so... (clicks tongue)

You need a ten-year plan.

Are you in a relationship that's headed towards marriage?

I am not currently, but I did go on a date with somebody named Charles last month.

She was a woman, but she was named after her uncle.

Well, Winston has no game.

Dude took a girl to a cement plant.

To see how rocks were made.

That's not where rocks are made.

And she loved it, then she abruptly moved away.

(groans)

Work sucked, my friends.

(nasally voice): Hear ye, hear ye.

Milady.

I dub you Sir Winston of the Roll of Egg.

(nasally): Ah, yes. Yes.

Who are you in this story?

I'm the jester.

I'm not gonna eat here anymore.

You'd think that the school board would want to give kids computers, but no, they just want to get reelected so they can keep dressing like Realtors from the 1980s.

Solid municipal burn, Jessica.

Fawn... Councilwoman.

Councilwoman... do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?

Oh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.

I'll put a word in with Yowtz.

Martha Yowtz?

Yeah.

The lioness of Los Angeles education?

Yes.

The straw that stirs the school board's drink?

That's right.

That is a woman I'd like to get to know.

Is there any way I could come with you to this event?

Ah, you know, it's really a networking thing.

Well, that's perfect, 'cause I'd love to network her.

With her. It's "with..."

You network with her.

Yeah, it's "network with her," and you don't really strike me as the "networking" type.

You're more of a "follow a butterfly around for a day" kind of gal.

Oh, sister, I'm a middle-school vice principal.

You think I got this job without knowing how to network?

Most likely. Yes.

I got an office with a door, bub.

Pencil me in. I'll yak with Yowtz.

The press will be there, and I could use a photo with an educator, so... okay.

Oh, great.

Oh. Hey.

Do you still need me for the photo op?

I will need you there, actually.

I'm trying to become more accessible on social media.

Speaking of which, is there some way you can make your skin look less white in photos?

People are saying that you're haunting me.

I can do that. Absolutely. 100%.

Let me just make a note.

Wonderful.

And, Jess, the event tomorrow is at a golf course.

Do you golf?

Does a bear eat with his hands? (chuckles)

I don't know.

I'll be there.

Great.

So I say to her, "Water? I barely even know you."

Stop talking to me like we're in the middle of a conversation.

We just sat down.

All right.

I hate when you do that.

Okay.

Winston.

That is a beautiful girl right there. Wow.

Just say something to her.

Yeah, just say something to her.

Shawty, what that thang do?

No.

What was that?

Winston: Dude, I think it's a nervous tic that stems from my lack of self-confidence.

We got to help. I can't watch this.

Excuse me, miss? Hi.

Coach, stop.

Um, this is my buddy, Winston.

Um... I don't know what he's doing with his mouth.

That's not his normal smile at all.

I'm gonna fix that. If I could just...

Both sides... even it out.

Better.

I think he likes you.

Oh, yeah?

Just go talk to her. You got it.

I don't...

Okay, okay, I'm going.

You got it. You got it. - He's coming.

He's excited to talk to you. Hey... My friends.

(laughter)

Hello.

I'm Winston Bishop.

Winston Bishop. KC.

KC! Just be like, "Yo, KC, where JoJo at?"

In rehab, probably.

He's... he was on drugs.

Yeah.

Winston: Sorry. Um...

I don't know what to say right now.

Uh, kind of bl*wing this, huh?

Uh...

Um, I think you're very beautiful, KC, and I would like to see you again soon... like, later today for lunch?

I'd love to.

Really?

Here.

Oh.

I'm gonna put in my number... or come with me to this thing in the park I'm going to now and we can grab something after.

You know, I saw Nick Nolte in the park once.

And I was like, "Yo, Nick Nolte, what you doing in the park?"

And he was just like, "I'm just hanging out."

Yeah, so I thought that was notable.

I'm going to a rally to protest the police.

Do you want to come?

Or we could just do lunch.

Let's do lunch.

Okay.

Yeah. Nice to... nice to meet you, KC.

Cece: Fawn is none of my business, and Schmidt seems to really like her, so whatever happens, I'm just not getting involved.

Then why are you on your way to hang out with him?

What are you doing?

He said to come over.

He said it was an emergency.

What if he does something sexy?

That's like Gollum hanging out with the One Ring.

It'll be fine.

Ooh. Hey, Cece, I'm glad you're here.

I need you to put bronzer all over my body.

None of the guys are here, and they also refused to do it.

Um, all over. I know you're giving me a look, but, really, like, all over.

All the cracks, the crevices.

The engine, the caboose, everything.

Oh, okay.

Gripped it and ripped it.

You da man.

No, say, "Fawn is the man."

Fawn's the man. Fawn's the man.

Oh, hey, there's Yowtz.

Woman's got more connections than a flight from Burbank to Sri Lanka.

Well, then, it's a good thing I bought the airport neck pillow in the gift shop, because... (chuckles)

You know what that means.

I got this.

Okay.

How the hell are you?

Jessica Day.

I need 20 computers for my school.

Just met you, but noted.

You're up.

Thanks.

What? Oh.

You walk towards the...

Whoops.

Oh, dear Lord.

Why are we putting this on your body?

Aren't you going to be wearing a shirt?

Well, you know, Fawn wants me to be prepared for all scenarios.

What if somebody gives birth out there and I have to swaddle the baby in my polo?

(wry chuckle) Yeah...

I've never been under this kind of scrutiny before.

I'm having my teeth shaved by a 25th of an inch.

Fawn thinks that I have the teeth of an immigrant.

She says every time she looks at me, all she can see is Fievel Mouskewitz singing "There Are No Cats in America."

Those little... those little mice Jews.

I mean, what do you think, Cece?

You... you like Fawn, right?

Yeah, I mean, as-as long as you're happy.

There you go.

What the hell?

What?

Why am I sparkly?

Sparkly?!

You bought the bronzer with glitter in it.

Cece, please, you gotta help me, Ce...

Fawn's gonna k*ll me!

Okay, just don't get too pressive. You'll crease!

So stupid! I feel like I'm trying to get into an 18-and-under club in Tucson!

So, yeah, at the rally, the was this kid I know from the youth center who was arrested last week because he "fit a description."

I mean, he's 14... he doesn't even fit into his jeans.

(uncomfortable laughter)

Yeah.

Anyways... enough about me. Let's, uh, talk about you.

What do you do?

What do I do?

Um... okay.

Well... what do I do?

Um...

Okay, the truth is...

Hey, man.

You know them?

Oh, not personally, no.

Hey, what's up, Bishop?

Oh, yeah, I do know them.

We went to school together.

See you at work, bud.

More importantly... we work together.

You're a cop?

Me? (laughs)

A cop? No!

No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't...

No, no, no. Get that out of your head.

Uh, what I do is I'm a... male stripper.

A stripper?

That's why they were wearing the uniforms.

Yeah, I see where you... why you would think that. No.

A surprising amount of day work for a stripper.

You know, we just go in there, we do our routine while they eat their lunch salads.

Wow. (laughs)

You just pray nobody orders soup.

Lost a lot of good men to soup.

(short laugh) It's hard to gauge temperature when you're just... dipping and running.

You'd be surprised what you could replace a ladle with.

Nice day.

Beautiful.

What happened to the top of my hat?

You take it?

(laughs) A little, uh... little visor humor.

Give me back my hat!

I'm kidding. (chuckles)

I wasn't gonna h*t you.

I'm just joshing.

Just Joshua, Joshua, joshing...

Do you ladies want to join my network?

Uh, you ladies can just go ahead and play through.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'll catch up with you later.

Uh, so, how-how do you feel that the networking is going?

Pretty good.

I would call it, like, a solid B.

It's a cruise ship disaster.

Look, Jess, if you want those computers, we have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it.

Shake my hand.

Gross.

What is your name?

Jess?

You have the confidence of a child that was raised in a basement.

Say it with pride, and include your job title like it's the second half of your name.

Like this... Fawn Moscato, City Council.

Jessica Day, Vice Principal!

How the heck are you?

Dawn: Lighten it up with a quick joke whenever possible.

Nice shoes.

Look like you chopped off Big Bird's feet, you m*rder. (laughs)

Fawn: And try not to make jokes about m*rder

Sesame Street puppets if you can.

Jess: Good note.

Fawn:  Now, tell me...

Are you wearing underwear?

Oh, yeah. Big-time.

Lose them. I never wear underwear in networking scenarios.

Gives you a secret; an edge.

Besides, I firmly believe that power emanates from the vag*na.

So, why block it?

It's not the only thing that emanates.

What does that mean?

(quietly): Other stuff.


So I said, "Tammy, are we playing golf, or are we making sand castles?"

(laughter)

Tammy is the worst.

She told my kid to shut up once. I nearly punched her.

I don't want to start talking business while we still have a whole tournament to play, but...

I'd love to connect about your ideas in the clubhouse.

Let's meet up there when we're all done.

Great. I'll see you in there, Marty.

May I call you Marty?

Oh, I'd prefer it.

(laughs)

The clubhouse?

That is where you close the deal.

You are in, my friend.

Now, let's finish up this game.

No problem.

Write a six and let's go. They should start putting GPS in golf b*lls, am I right?

We already got lapped by Sue Kim from the Korean Women's League, and she's 100.

Jess, she is literally 100 years old.

And I'm... I'll tell you what...

Not a young 100.

Martha doesn't strike me as the type of person who gives computers to cheaters.

You really don't understand how networking works.

The computers are just the thing you talk about when you're really talking about how to help each other become more powerful.

Just like the money for this golf thing... it doesn't go to charity. It just pays for the event where we network.

Isn't that cool?

Yay, America.

Were the computers ever really on the table?

You're still talking about the computers?

Okay. Uh, no. No. No money for computers.

I should've never listened to you. I also should have never removed my underwear, because now it's drafty and I feel vulnerable to wildlife.

Are your underwear sticking out of your pocket?

Are those boys' underwear?

They're unisex. None of your business.

Look, will you forget the ball? Or none of these women are ever going to invite you to play golf again.

Well, I don't want to play golf with these women again.

I don't want any part of this.

If I can't have the computers, I will... I will stay here and I will play a clean game of golf.

Now, if you'll excuse me, Fawn, I need to go find my ball.

Like an honest person.

Okay.

Oh, look... it's a baby bird.

No, it's a d*ad baby bird.

I need to move on before I get emotional.

Can't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.

With everything that's been going on, I just...

I feel like she wouldn't respect me.

You want to know what I think?

No, Nick, I don't.

This is something you can't understand.

Because I'm not black?

Uh...

What, because I don't work for NASA, I can't fix a rocket ship?

If you don't work at NASA, they're not gonna just let you walk off the street and fix a rocket ship.

You're missing my point.

Besides, you lost your right to talk to me about race during the O.J. trial.

Is in the white Bronco...

Why does it have to be a "white" Bronco?

Why not just a Bronco?

I can talk to you about this.

I mean, we grew up together.

We went to the same schools, we watched the same shows, we listened to the same records.

Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and bitch chew like this. (grunts, laughs)

Hercules.

Was that your Eddie Murphy?

That's Eddie Murphy.

That was so bad, it wasn't even offensive.

I said "Hercules," and everyone associates that with Eddie Murphy.

Whenever you do your impressions, it makes me super uncomfortable.

Fine. You know what? You want to do this?

You and me are gonna get weird about race?

Do your Seinfeld.

Come... Nick, that's not...

Do your Seinfeld.

What's the deal with bananas?

I mean, they got orange juice, you got apple juice, where's the banana juice?

(laughs): I never thought of that.

Ah, boy.

'Cause you got orange juice, you...

I love you, but you're white, I'm black.

I understand where she's coming from.

When I was a kid, we used to run from the police.

Even if we did nothing wrong, it was just out of habit.

Why haven't you ever told me?

Coach: 'Cause you'll never get it.

How long have you been standing there?

Uh, right around, "Your mama got a mouth on the back of her neck, and the bitch chew like this."

Now, that's Eddie!

I don't see the difference.

(laughs): Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

He's doing the laugh!

That's what I was doing.

(imitating Eddie Murphy's laugh)

Stop, Nick.

I honestly don't see the difference.

As the only other black man in this loft, I feel like I should weigh in.

This issue really hits home with me, and I feel like I have a lot of thoughts and ideas that I need to get off my chest.

Thank you, Coach.

But I'm hungry.

Man.

I skipped breakfast, and lunch is gonna be dumb as hell.

♪ Race talk snacks ♪
♪ Race talk snacks, gotta get me ♪
♪ Some race talk snacks ♪
♪ Gonna be super uncomfortable! ♪

So, KC...

Shh...

I just feel like...

Can't-can't weigh in.

I know, but I...

Can't weigh in.

I do have something I want to say that's not a race...

Shh, don't.

I know what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna tell her the truth.

I'm a good guy; that's all that matters.

That's what I was gonna say.

I want to make this... No, no, no.

Shut it down, Nick.

Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and she chews like this.

Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.

So the good news is you can't see the glitter anymore. Great.

Well, what's the bad news?

You look like, um... can't exactly put my finger on it.

I look like the d*ad body the police pull out of a lake.

That's how you describe it; you look d*ad.

I don't want to look like a d*ad boy.

I want to look like a living boy.

Why are you calling yourself a boy?

Because I'm freaking out!

(phone vibrating) Freaking...

Freaking out. Oh, no.

It's-it's Fawn.

(sighs)

Hey, Faw... hey, Fawn.

What the Jewish God did you do?

In an attempt to look less ghost-like, I put on some bronzer, but the bronzer had glitter in it, and now...

You look like a wood carving of yourself.

The press is here.

And single women have proven to be less appealing to voters.

Fix it and get here now.

I am Fawn Moscato, and I will not miss a photo opportunity!

Faw... Oh.

Fawn?

How about a fake beard?

Get some double-sided tape, we can shave Winston's cat...

Okay, you know what, enough.

I cannot just stand here and watch Fawn treat you like she's your pageant mom.

She needs to accept you exactly how you are, or you need to find somebody that will.

'Cause I think you are fine as is.

Damn it.

You know what, you're right. I'm gonna go talk to her.

Can you drive though? I want to fix my makeup in the car.

For me, not for her.

I don't want to scare anybody. Ugh.

I think I'm drunk from my face fumes.

I've never seen so many strokes taken on a single hole in all of my life.

This has got to be some kind of record.

Do you care to comment?

Hey!

Not bad! Look at her go!

The hole's behind you.

Thanks, Marty.

172!

Par was five.

I know, Marty.

You're the worst golfer I've ever seen.

Look, I don't care if I look stupid.

I didn't come here to climb the ladder.

The only reason why I came here was to get computers for my students.

And that's the only reason why I came: for the school.

I respect that.

I'll get you those computers.

Really?!

Yes, I will.

In 2018, when the district is fiscally solvent.

I'll... take that as a victory.

I support Vice Principal Day.

It is education that will bring water back to this city and will rebuild the middle class...

Don't let me back down.

Don't worry, I will not.

You look... so crazy right now.

You look like a doll boy.

A doll man.

I'm a d... I'm a doll man.

A doll man who's about to get his dignity back.

Let's b*at China!

I'm Fawn Moscato! (chuckles)

Oh!

(crowd cheers) Oh.

(laughs): I can't believe it.

Now, this ball is a symbol...

(crowd gasps)

(laughter) of the unity...

Man: Wow!

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn.

What? What's going on?

You're not wearing any, uh...

Each one's like a snowflake.

What do you mean there's a meme?

It speaks?

Well, what does it say?

Oh, well, that is just crass.

Yes, I know I wanted a more accessible Web pr...

Will you stop laughing, Lou?

You're a father!

You're my father!

(gasps)

Oh, no, no, it's... it's carpet cleaner.

You know, I thought I'd take it right down to the base.

I'll probably have to regrow some skin, but it's all right.

It's okay, Schmidt.

Look, I understand if you want to break up with me.

I'm a laughingstock, and you shouldn't be associated with my brand.

Which is tainted.

An unfortunate choice of words.

So, what was it you wanted to say to me?

Fawn, I don't want to break up with you.

I like you just the way that you are.

No offense, but you're terrifying to look at, and you smell like a chemical f*re.

Taint that the truth?

Yeah.

Did you see what I did there?

I just...'Cause you did it, then I...

It was too... too soon. It's too soon.

I wanted you to feel good about when you said it though.

Okay.

KC?

So... um... this is the real me.

I'm proud of what I do, I really am.

I work with a lot of great people, and I want to be one of them.

Plus, if there are ever Ghostbusters, I know they're gonna recruit from law enforcement first.

I know you're mad at me.

I just came to say that.

I'm not mad that you're a cop.

I'm mad that you lied.

Well, tell you what, uh, is there any way I could take you out again and, you know, uh, be so honest with you that it scares the hell out of you?

I don't know.

That uniform is kind of distracting, isn't it?

Maybe you should... take it off.

(laughs)

You lied and said you were a stripper; it seems like the fair thing to do.

(dance music playing)

Just in front of all these people?

In front of your colleagues? (man whoops)

Oh, okay. I hear some "whoos!"

(whoops)

You ain't got no Ginuwine or nothing?

Seriously though, I'm...

I'm... I really am a police officer.

I can't really be here stripping for you...

It's a clip-on ladies.

And it's on the ground.

Here we go. Uh-huh, I want y'all to get y'all ones ready.

I wear my underwear two sizes too big.

This is a... This is a thing. This is a thing I gotta do in order to get my belt off.





Ugh! Can you believe this guy?

Pete is over an hour late for our brunch date.

Pete? Who's Pete?

Oh, it's this dude who goes to my gym.

Thought Jess could use a man with a little muscle for a change, so I set 'em up.

Not gonna marry him, but I'm having fun.

(chuckles) Knock, knock. Who's there?

Orange. Hang on a second, Orange.

I'm gonna send a sext to Pete, which I did.

My first one ever. Want to see? It's super hot.

I don't want to, uh...

Okay, that's just a picture of you in a bra over a T-shirt Holding a sign that says "Property of Pete."

Not a sext.

I'm wearing a bra!

No, that's like a glorified selfie.

You can see the bra.

Nope.

(scoffs) I bet he saw this, and he was like, (in low voice): "Oh, delicious."

You want him to say that?

I have to agree, (phone blipping) because the true nature of eroticism is what is not shown.

Coach: I never get sexts.

What are you taking?

Just some, uh... motion sickness pill.

It's a mild sedative.

My mom just landed.

That's unrelated.

Oh, my God, your mom's here?!

I'm so excited to meet her.

You probably won't; she's busy.

But maybe, hopefully, I doubt it.

I can't believe I've never met her.

You know, we get together and we laugh and...

(sighs) she tells me all the ways that I could be better at things, and then I do them, but not right.

Oh, it's fun.

We have, we have fun.

You know, I wish I had fun with my partner.

Wow, every time I ask Aly to hang out, she's always like, "Nah."

Nick: Hey, Schmidty, vamos.

I want to show you a surprise investment opportunity.

Surprise, Nick? I'm telling you right now, if it is a boat, I'm gonna be so psyched!

I literally jut got new boat shoes.

Jess: (sputters) Standing here like a damn jabroni.

He hasn't even answered any of my texts.

He hasn't?

You don't think he's...

(gasping) He is bl*wing you off!

He best not be!

Hell no!

You guys are getting riled up, huh?

We are gonna march right over there, and we all right gonna find out what's happening!

Let's go.

(door closes) (groans)

Turns out that Pete had a very good excuse for not showing up.

He d*ed.

What?

Winston: ♪ Just got out of the shower ♪
♪ Guess who cleaned everything? ♪
♪ Guess who got in deep? ♪

What?

A motorcycle accident? I didn't even know Pete rode one.

He didn't. Apparently, he was thinking about getting one, and he slipped and fell on the showroom floor.

Buffed floors... beautiful, but at what cost?

The first guy I sext dies.

I should go to the memorial, right?

Jess, don't make this about yourself, all right?

You went on two dates with the guy.

I was one of the last people to text him.

On Earth.

Cece: Look, you didn't even have sex with him, okay? You're fine.

So if I'd slept with him, I'd go.

Or if you'd gone skiing together.

Mm-hmm, yeah.

What are these rules?

Coach: Just don't go.

'Cause if you go, then I'm gonna feel weird about not going, and I ain't going.

Yeah, just come and have a mani-pedi with me.

I'm going; it's the right thing to do.

Oh, so if I don't go, I'm a bad person now?

Cece.

Mm-hmm.

I'm surprised. I thought you, of all people, would want to accompany your best friend to the funeral of a guy she texted, but...

I guess... not.

♪ Ta-da! ♪

What do you mean?

What is ta-da? We drove here together and parked before you covered my eyes.

What is the surprise investment, Nick?

The bar.

Mike's selling us ten percent.

I really need the cash.

I got swindled by a young gay roller skater.

A rink twink.

I know what a rink twink is, Mike.

Hey, 20 thou and we are part owners, okay?

I've done my research.

There's a consistent revenue and no startup costs.

You're really serious about this, huh?

I really want this, man.

Good. I want this, too.

Good.

Where are we gonna get 20 grand from?

Well, we got the ten grand we made on the Swuit.

Maybe do we have any rich friends we can borrow money from?

Well, let's think about it. There's the middle school vice principal, there's the cop, the gym teacher.

Let's not forget about the community college student.

Whew, lot of options.

Yeah.

It's tough, it's frustrating.

Yeah, huh... damn it.

Schimdty just had an idea. I know that face.

Give it to me, give it to me.

What are you thinking, big cat?

What are you thinking, big cat?

I just...

(grunts) Think, now, if we own it, don't be kicking it.

Just... Yeah, oh.

Aah!

Ouch.

Okay.

Hey, pal, uh, what's happening?

My mom still owes me my bar miztvah money.

I mean, we can ask her, but, you know, she's...

Pushy, overbearing, controlling.

So, what?

Oh, she's a typical Jewish mom?

It's anti-Semitic when you say it like that.

So-so what, she likes to get involved?

That's great, you know.

I don't feel very comfortable when I'm around her.

Well, boo-hoo, she thinks you want to have sex with her.

Try learning about the birds and the bees from her using a doughnut and a banana. By the way, neither one of which are used for what you think they are.

How could that be?

Hey, want to grab a bite later?

You know it, partner. (laughs)

Hey, Aly, uh, want to grab a beer after work?

Ooh...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

(groaning)

Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba.

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

Ooh.

(humming)

(grunting)

(clicking tongue)

Uh, ooh.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

No.

Oh, come on.

Not work related, not interested, Bishop.

We're professionals, not friends.

Oh God, here we go. Showtime.

Mama!

No!

I was meeting my little boy, not this handsome movie star.

What are you doing with these?

Why would you hide your hazels?

(laughs) Hi, sweetheart.

Oh!

Hey, Louise, it's really good to see you.

I bet it is; tape it down, Miller.

Tape it?

Here, look at your baby brother.

How handsome is Reggie?

(kisses) Give him a kiss.

Kiss your brother. Give him a kiss.

Give him a kiss; he loves it. Kiss him, kiss him.

Okay, give him a scratch. He loves a scratch.

He loves a scratch.

Can I get an alcohol?

So, how's Susan?

Susan's my-my mom's work friend who she lives with.

Susan cuts her own firewood.

Susan's my girlfriend.

That's what I said, your work friend.

She's good. We just got a new mattress.

So work's been more comfortable.

(chuckling)

What?

What-what now?

Is it my sweater? Is it too dark?

It might be. Here.

You got, you got me a sweater?

Mm-hmm. Now that's nice.

That's nice. Try it on.

I'm trying, I'm put-putting it on right now.

It goes over your head.

He's putting a sweater on a sweater?

Get over it. Get over it.

That's nice, very nice.

Thank you so much. I love this so much.

Schmidt, isn't there something you want to ask your mother about?

Schmidt: Well, I did... I did want to ask you about...

Your voice is wavering.

Here, have some chocolate.

No, Mom, I'm okay. Thank you.

Have it.

Here, have it, have it, have it.

I'll just have one.

Have it, have it.

Have it, have it.

There you go. I do love it. Hmm!

So, I... What I was thinking about was... uh... my bar mitzvah money.

Can I have it?

Oh, my God! Of course you can! Yes.

Oh, that was... yeah, so easy.

As soon as you write your thank-you notes.

You didn't forget, did you?

He never did his thank-you cards.

Schmidt: Mom, I just thought that you know, that was so long ago...

Well, you know.

If I just gave you the money, what kind of lesson would that be?

You finish your cards, you get the money.

That's fair, isn't it?

You didn't finish your thank-you cards?

There's a hat in the bag, too. Try it on.

Put it on.

That's very nice.

Take it off, you're in a restaurant.

Sure about this? It's not too late to bail.

We're going.

It's the right thing to do.

Look, we'll be in and out of there in five minutes.

It'll be so packed, no one will notice.

(whispering): The right thing to do.

Is it?

And uh... Pete said...

"If you gotta puke, Duffy, just puke."

Almost time to tell the story about your close friend Pete.

I'm just gonna tell the truth.

We went on a few dates. That's it.

I'm Val, Pete's girlfriend.

(sobs) I'm sorry.

Would you mind going?

How did you know Pete?

(clears throat quietly)

Um, from work.

We worked together.

You're a sports agent, too?

Wow...

Yep.

Okay, we got a lot of thank-you cards to write and not a lot of time.

Let's get into it. I'll start, okay?

Let's go, here we go.

"To whom it may concern..."

To... to whom it may concern?

I'm on a vibe.

Nick, these need to have personal details.

My mom is gonna check them.

All right, then get me the guest list.

Where have you imagined that I've been holding onto the guest list for all these years?

Just carrying it around in my wallet? This is impossible.

This is gonna take some serious detective work.

(chuckles)

It's a good thing I can call backup.

Hey.

You said this was a work thing.

It is a work thing.

It's a... work-style thing.

You see, we need your skills to solve a cold case.

Aly: Hey, you want your bar mitzvah money? Tell me her name.

I don't remember.

I don't believe you!

Just relax. Relax. Here, Schmidt.

Sip that.

Want to hear the music again?

(hip-hop music playing)

All right, there we go.

Uh-huh.

Yeah, you're 13 years old, everybody's feeling it...

♪ Motown Philly's back again... ♪ - Enough.

What was her name?!

Sharon Rosenberg!

Okay. 257 Sea Cove Drive, 11021.

Okay. "Dear Mrs. Rosenberg...

Thank you for the check."

I need a personal detail!

Personal detail!

She had a pool.

"Cannonball!

Love, Schmidt." 

Winston: Cannonball!

Okay, Schmidt. All right, Schmidt.

Who's this guy?

Schmidt: I don't know, Winston.

It's too far away, I can't tell.

Uh... enhance, enhance, enhance...

Okay, too far, too far.

Dehance, dehance.

Scott Rubenstein!

Scott Rubenstein.

My mom's CPA.

Scott Rubenstein... deceased.

Yes!

Yes!

Love the d*ad ones.

You know, Pete wasn't just a sports agent.

He understood sports.

Like, he knew the rules, all of them: offsides, unnecessary bumping, what happens if you h*t a bird with the ball you throw...

Excuse-excuse me.

Can I, uh, borrow her for a second?

Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

What's up?

Uh... what the hell are you doing?

I'm trying to save that poor girl's feelings.

If she knew the truth, it would shatter her.

I am going to the nail salon, okay?

Bye.

Cece... - I'm out.

Hey, wait! Guys, wait.

No, stop... guys.

The only sport I know is Ricky Ball, and I'm pretty sure my friend Ricky made that up.

No. Lying about who you are is not the right thing to do.

I am going.

Coach...

(whimpering) Is this, uh... is this Pete's thing? He was my agent.

Of course he was.

Who else would represent NFL star J.J. Watt?

Uh, Pete was my best friend and, uh...

God, it's good to see you.

Louise: Wouldn't the couch be better over there? All that light?

Or do you like to live like a radish, underground?

So we worked really hard on the... on the cards.

Let's see what we got.

Okay.

But you know what would be better?

Connie's into gardening.

You should mention that.

And if you really want your card to pop, you can use a nice fountain pen on silver stationery.

And you should sign your full name, not just Schmidt.

I mean, you have a lovely first name.

Great! I'll just make all those changes, Mom!


(door slams) Okay.

You're not getting me into your pants, you little jackhammer.

Oh, I don't want you in my pants, Louise.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

So then Pete says to...

Allen Iverson.

"...you want to keep sportsing on the... "

Grizzlies.

Jess: "...but if you want me to show you the money, then... You gotta finish your career off with the '76ers!"

(chuckles) And it was classic Pete.

It's so nice to remember work as more than just a thing that kept Pete on the phone all the time.

You're very welcome.

Oh, Val, you should have Pete's phone.

All those memories and photos...

It's in the garage with all his stuff.

I'll give it to you before you go.

Val: Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, we gotta find that phone before Val sees the sext.

Yes, it is the right thing to do.

Like I've said all along. I got a good thing going with J.J. and I'm not gonna let you ruin it.

That's the funeral spirit.

What are you guys doing in here?

What are you doing here?

I'm looking for Pete's phone.

So are we! Did you sext him, too?

No. I fired Pete over text, so I didn't want to crush his family.

That's why I'm at the memorial.

Not because it was the right thing to do?

No. No. I mean, we never even went skiing.

Who makes up these rules?

Now...

What are you guys doing out here?

Um...

Singing.

S... What?

We like to sing.

Together. About...

Sports.

Food.

Sports foods.

Val: That's fun.

It's...

Would you guys...

Would it be putting you on the spot if I asked you to do one?

I think that wouldn't be appropriate.

Coach: Actually, yes.

That work-style thing was pretty fun.

Let's parlay that into a beer.

My buddy has a bar he works at, down the street.

It's carpeted, so...

Bishop, what don't you get?

No.

(SUV door opens, shuts)

(engine starts)

Are you okay?

Oh, hey, man. Thanks.

Yeah, I don't know, man. It's just...

I'm talking to a ladybug.

Squeeze my hand!

Just one more push! You're almost there!

The first child is always the hardest!

Hey, bud.

Hard candy?

Is it butterscotch?

No, 'cause we're friggin' strangers.

(laughs): "Is it butterscotch?"

So, you freaked out a little back there, didn't you?

Not to use some Popsicle psychology...

"Popsicle psychology"?

Yeah, it's pop psychology for short.

'Cause, you know, you eat the Popsicle and you love it so much and then you're stuck holding the-the stick?

You get it. you get it.

Not really, but...

I think you have some pent-up resentment towards your mom.

She's trying to control you!

She treats you like a little baby who can't do anything for himself.

That's why I never wrote the cards in the first place.

Go tell that to your mom!

She'll understand.

I don't understand.

The couch looks good here though, doesn't it?

It opens up the whole room.

Louise, I think what your boy is trying to say is...

Shut it, Nick.

Honey, why do you hang out with him?

You know Nancy Borkow? Her son just moved to L.A.

He wrote a movie script for the movies.

I can connect you. You need better friends!

Enough, Mom!

You don't get to choose my friends!

You don't get to choose anything!

Because this is my life!

It's my dream and nothing's gonna stop me now!

It feels like that's from something.

It feels like, it feels like it's from a movie or something.

Yeah, I think it's a song. It's a song.

It's the Perfect Stranger theme.

Well, you know, it doesn't matter!

You know, we did a good job with those cards, Mom.

And we don't need any of your money.

Whoa, we're all being very emotional.

Let's just slow everything...

I'm moving the couch back!

Gosh!

Did you nail that thing down?

That's... You move that all by yourself?

I'm an adult man, Mom.

And Nick is my best friend in the whole wide world.

And we're gonna buy a small portion of that bar without any of your help.

(sighs) (door slams)

And also, there's some leftover chili in the fridge if you get hungry, and, please, make sure to put a plate over it before you put it in the microwave.

(screams) Aah!

Shucks!

Sorry!

I thought I saw Pete's ghost!

It was a paint can. (laughs)

(all chuckle) Are you sure about...?

Ugh! We gotta find this phone.

And get the hell out of here.

Okay, it's ringing.

Can anybody hear it?

(cell phone ringing) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

There's another box.

What the hell...? "Property of Pete"?

He made my sext his called I.D.?

This is a sext?

JJ fired him over text!

After the day I had, I needed this.

Me, too.

What happened?

I know you were talking to yourself.

Now you're talking to a stranger.

Get over it.

Is that a crime in California? What happened?

I got dragged to a random dude's funeral.

Who dragged you? My friend. She always thinks she knows what's best.

Who's your friend... me? (both laugh)

No.

I got accused of that today by my son.

He's tired of me babying him.

But he's my baby, so what am I supposed to do?

Maybe you have to let go a little.

This is why strangers talk.

You're a genius.

Want to see a picture of my son? He's handsome.

Nah. I'm kind of in love with my ex, so...

All right, you can't date him anyway.

You're not Jewish, so over my d*ad body and all that.

(laughs)

(laughs)

Today was not a win for me.

It's the right thing to do.

I don't even know what that means.

Well, you made today about yourself.

Mm.

Not to use popcorn psychology, but it's human nature.

You know? Soon as I saw JJ walk in, I was, like, "JJ Watt, be my best friend."

(both chuckle)

(sighs)

I got to do something.

Should I tell Aly off? Uh... put in for a new partner?

What's the right thing to do here?

I can say with 100% certainty I have no idea.

Look at you. I'm proud of you.

I learned from the best.

That's awesome.

What a wonderful moment we're having today!

You know what? I'll figure it out myself.

Thank you.

This is from that sixth grader over there.

(quietly): Hmm?

Aly, what are you doing here?

I just wanted to explain. Look...

I hung out a lot with my last partner.

And we got close and...

You sh*t him?

What?

He d*ed?

No.

Oh, my goodness... is he...?

Did he survive?

What are you talking about?

How did you partner die?

He didn't die!

So, what's your point?

He just fell in love with me!

Oh... oh! Oh!

Yeah.

Ooh...

And it messed everything up.

And I just don't want that to happen again.

Damn, you're conceited!

Don't nobody want your babies.

I know that now!

I mean, you brought me to your loft and showed me a bar mitzvah video.

Friends?

Cool, cool.

Just, uh... don't go falling in love with me.

'Cause I'm lovable as hell.

Okay.

I think I'll be okay.

All right.

Another!

(whoops)

Oh, my.

Michael... we'd like to buy your share of the bar.

And although we don't have the full $20,000 at the present...

You don't have the money? No.

But we're the right guys.

No, the right guys would have the money.

Or Kieran Culkin's mouth.

How about Owen Wilson's nose?

(groans)

Mom?

Oh, my God!

Schmidt, is this your mom?

Hi. I've heard so much about you.

How's Long Island?

Any cute Schmidt stories?

I need less from you.

Okay.

I met a Mexican woman at the nail salon... who made me realize...

I need to let go.

You're a man.

And you deserve your bar mitzvah money.

Thanks, Mom.

Mike, we want to buy your ten percent of the bar.

This bar?!

There's a dying catfish laying on the sidewalk out front!

This would be a hilarious time for me to back out... but okay.

Yes! We're part owners!

Both (chanting): We're part owners!

How great this moment?

I just think you'd be more of a success socially if you let people come to you.

You know what's fun?

I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we're best friends.

(groans)

Jess: Nick, can you believe it?

You're a bar owner.

I'm so proud of you.

None of this would've happened without Schmidt standing up to his mom.

It was so scary.

I can't believe I missed her.

We still can use the other 90% of the bar, right?

Yeah You know, that's not how it works.

It's just this is my favorite section. I wanted to...

It's a financial share.

To Schmidt's mom. I do want to have sex with her.

(Shouting) Nick.





Nick: Your hair looks so different.

Well, get used to it, boys.

'Cause we're single, we're sophisticated.

And we just went to a place to get blow-outs.

What's a blow-out?

You know how it's possible to make your own hair look amazing?

Uh, I do not.

Yeah, you know whose hair I admire?

Jesus. Man, dude's hair get overlooked because of all the miracles and stuff.

So, there's a place that just bl*ws out your hair?

Well, they wash it first.

So, essentially they create a problem, and then charge you to fix it.

Here's a, a business idea I just thought of.

Why don't I break the heels off your shoe, and then charge you to glue them back on?

Or, uh, take your sore back and adjust it.

Which would, uh, just make me a chiropractor.

You ladies need to be very careful.

Blow-out can give a woman too much confidence.

Make them take on things that they can't handle.

Hillary Clinton.

Oh, hey, Ken. You can just put the beer behind the bar.

Oh, actually I was coming over here to talk to the pretty ladies.

(both laugh)

Nice hair.

(both laugh)

(laughs) Hey, Jess.

Hey, Cece.

Bear Claw, hello.

I'd offer you my hand, but it's quite wet.

Still standing close to people.

My building has cable Internet now.

Did you get even prettier?

(laughs): What?

No.

What? No.

What... no.

You and Cece should come to a party at our place tonight.

I live with Ken.

Ken played football in college.

Do a football thing, Ken!

I'm kidding, Ken.

Nobody wants to see that garbage.

Anyway, gonna be some cool people there.

We know twin architects.

Yeah, they're... brothers.

Ken, what did we talk about?!

Huh?

Some people understand things that don't come quite naturally to your brain!

Stupid dum-dum.

Stay out of this. You guys want to come?

Um, could you excuse us for a second?

Yeah.

You played that all wrong, you stupid idiot.

Cece, I know these guys are weird, but parties have cute guys who aren't Schmidt.

What did Charisma say while he was washing our hair?

He said he was worried about Taylor Swift living in New York all alone.

Well, yeah, we all are, but he also said that we need to embrace our freedom.

We're single. We can do whatever we want!

The only thing stopping us is us.

And Charisma made us promise not to waste these blow-outs.

Our hair does look so good right now.

Let's do this! Let's go to this party!

Let's see where this journey takes us!

(birds chirping)

Good morning.

Hi.

Do you want to hear a funny story?

This green pillow over here, I always use it in between my legs like a... like a second person.

But it found its proper home underneath your head today.

(both laugh)

Man: Hey, hey... mamma Mia!

He slipped in the sauce. Bookmark this one.

Coach, get in here! We're watching videos of Italians falling down.

Oh, he's on a jog with May. You know, I think he might've met his match with that one.

Rumor has it they haven't even kissed yet.

What was all that noise in their room if they haven't kissed yet?

That's weird.

Stop listening by everybody's rooms for sex sounds, Winston. (laughs)

Listen, if I'm not getting it, Hey! Hey!

I want to make sure everybody else is getting it.

Winston, I mean it, man.

Good morning!

I, uh, I believe you all know May.

Hi.

If you'd like to exchange pleasantries, please do so now, as she as on her way out.

Why are you talking like you're high and I'm your dad?

Sorry I can't stay. I'm performing at a benefit today.

Oh. I'm playing Bach's "Cello Suite No. 1," and all I have left to learn is the cadenza movement, so it's...

Well, at least it's not the saraband.

Oh! Oh, my God! (laughing)

Right? I get this.

That's crazy.

Hey, you guys should come.

Yeah, it's at an art gallery.

Yeah, yeah. I-I think I speak for everyone when I say absolutmont.

(laughter)

Something about Italians on their asses, man.

Both (gasp): Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

You have stickers on your neck. (groans)

Ow!

"The man, the legend"?

Wouldn't that mean he has no penis at all?

Look, I had no choice, okay?

He's sleeping on my shirt.

We need to go! Walk of shame!

Let's make a move...

Wait, a minute. Why do women have to have a label for going home in the morning when for men it's just... going home.

Why don't we just call ourselves what we are?

Two respectable women... rushing to their car.

Great.

Aah!

Aah!

Oh!

The sun! Hellfire!

Where's the car? Where's my car?

No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

No! No! No, no, no, no!

No, no, no, no, no!

No, no, no!

What are we gonna do?

My phone's d*ad.

My phone is d*ad, too.

I have no cash. Now, what are we gonna do?

Are we gonna walk?

My feet are wrecked, okay?

And carrying shoes?

That's legit walk of shame.

Please stop saying "walk of shame."

Also "legit."

Not crazy about that word, either.

If that South African runner who k*lled his girlfriend can run with no legs, we can walk in heels.

Cece: Excuse you!

Those little bitches throwing us shade? Hey!

Keep it moving! (both laugh)

This is a middle school vice principal and can give both of you detention.

Jess: Hey, would one of you let us use your phone in exchange for...

Cece?

What? Mm-hmm.

Cheese and a condom?

It's for emergencies.

Do you think Nick and Winston should come to May's thing?

No.

I mean, I'm so freaked out that they're gonna embarrass me.

I'm barely holding my own with May's friends as it is.

It's always Neo-romanticism with that guy... like Rihm, Rochberg, Zwilich.

You know what song I find Neo-romantic?

(humming Johnny Pearson's "Heavy Action")

It's Monday Night Football?

Uh...

Why is it, like, weird right now?

It's a good thing that I'm coming with you.

I know a ton about classical music.

I played the ghost of Rachmaninoff in a loosely based high school production of Shine.

Now, do you think I'm crazy for, like, thinking like that?

Like, what do you think about Nick and Winston coming?

You know, I brought Nick to a work dinner once.

(whoops) That was fun!

Now, that place was fancy.

(groans)

(grunts)

Vest without a shirt?

I mean, it's a clean look.

It's just not for that occasion. You-you don't think we should tell them not to come, though, right?

I think we can tell them whatever we want.

Oh, hey, hey. And then... so, that's, it's his side.

Hey, Nick!

(sputters)

What's up, man?

Nick, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up!

Male voice: The voice mailbox for...

Nick: Penis Wilson.

Male voice: is full. Good-bye.

And there it is.

All the numbers I know by heart.

That's more than me.

Learn from us.

Also, never open a line of credit for your boyfriend no matter how talented of an artist he is.

Uh, we are walking.

We're walking.

Cece: All right.

This is a legit walk of shame.

Oh, yeah. (car horn honks)

Rough start, ladies!

It was the blow-out.

It was the blow-out.

It's gonna be okay. Come on, let's go.

Oh, my God, they look so comfy.

Okay, you got it, okay? You got it.

Just give it a good... (grunts)

Oh, God, I need those sneakers.

Ooh!

So close, so close.

You got it on this one, you got it, you got it.

Yeah.

(screams)

No! No!

Let's follow that train.

Jess: Look at it, just sitting there, so full and so watery.

If we steal that water, are we criminals?

If we cross this fence, are we crossing a line that we can never...?

Shut up, we are going in.

Winston: Makes sense.

Ugh, I can't believe we have to go to that stupid music thing.

I just found these two-for-one coupons to the water park.

Wow.

They reopened the wave pool because it's been two years to the day since that guy d*ed.

R.I.P. Mike Beakman.

Schmidt: All right, you know what?

I'll... I'll take one for the team.

You guys go to the water park, and I'll go with Coach.

Coach: Really?

My eyes react poorly to children's urine anyway.

Don't ask me how I know that.

Sweet.

You guys are gonna have so much fun without us.

Yeah, come on, Coach.

Man...

Let's go put on our most scrotum-crushing trousers.

Thanks a lot, guys.

(chuckles)

Those lousy serpents.

They don't want us to come.

Damn lousy serpents.

(hissing)

They must think we're stupid.

I don't want to go...

Mm-hmm.

But I don't like the idea of not going because they don't want us to go, rather than not going because we don't want to go.

That's right, 'cause if we don't go, then who gonna go when we don't want to, 'cause we go.

Right? Rewind.

Come on, I'm being very clear here.

Where are we going and why?

We're going everywhere for both reasons.

(hissing)

How do you do it so smooth?

(hisses) Just... (hisses) ...exhale.

(stuttering hiss)

(smooth hiss)

(stuttering hiss)

I just can't do it. I don't even care about it.

Just gonna...

Oh, that's heavy.

Yeah.

Okay.

Let's just knock it over. Push it ov... push it.

Push, push...

Go.

Oh! Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back.

We're trapped.

Now what? Wait until the kid's party's over?

Kids unwrap presents so slowly.

I know. Kids are so slow.

I think this is rock bottom.

Cece...

I have to tell you something embarrassing.

What?

I didn't sleep with Bear Claw last night.

I did something even worse.

We made up a musical about woodland creatures.

♪ Owls and squirrels and deer ♪
♪ Raccoon and caribou ♪
♪ And otters ♪
♪ Get out of here, you're not welcome ♪
♪ Get out of here ♪
♪ Get out of here ♪
♪ Caribou, caribou... ♪

(laughing) It's true.

Heh.

Why did you make it seem like...

Because I didn't have a one-night stand like a normal woman.

I stayed up all night pretending to be a singing tree.

♪ I'm just a dumb old tree ♪
♪ You're not, take it back ♪
♪ Nobody ever pets me-e-e-e ♪
♪ 'Cause you're just a tree ♪
♪ They just eat my nuts ♪
♪ Eat my nuts, eat my nuts. ♪

You're right. That is way more shameful.

(giggles weakly) All right.

Confession.

I did not sleep with Ken, either.

Yeah, we started hooking up and then I called him... Schmidt.

That's okay. It happens.

Twice.

Whatever.

Four times.

Okay, that's bad.

I know, I felt so bad afterwards, I straightened up his room.

I am a grown woman that is in love with her ex-boyfriend that has a girlfriend.

And I've been stealing my neighbor's Wi-Fi.

I mean, what have I become?

This day is about to turn around.


Wait.

Coach.

What?

Just-just put it in your pocket.

No, dude. It had pork belly on it.

Just put it in your pocket. Do it.

I used to play the violin.

Then I became a real musician.

(laughs)

Because your instrument's bigger, right?

(chuckles)

Cello knowledge.

Yeah.

(whispering): The cello is bigger.

Nice.

(Nick and Winston laughing)

The hell are they doing here?

I don't know.

They're drinking at a normal pace.

There's nothing stuck to them.

Exactly.

The hell are they up to?

You are a genius.

Sweet, sweet city water.

Okay. You know how today's been kind of like a-a crappy day?

Mm-hmm.

Well, how would you feel if that hose belonged to your ex-boyfriend?

Jess?

Genzlinger!

Hey! Uh...

Blast from the past!

How's that ass?

That ass is good.

I don't know if that's an expression, but...

How the heck are you?

Good. How... Oop.

Heh. Don't know why I did that.

Did it again. I don't know why.

Why you guys dressed up all nice? Huh?

Talking all polite and stuff. What-What's going on?

Oh, we're just here for the culture and, uh, the spectacle of it all.

Really?

And to make you look like a stupid piece of crap for thinking we'd be an embarrassment to you.

I'm patting you down.

Hey.

I'm an American citizen.

I request a female if you're gonna do that.

Stop it. Stop.

Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

Ah, ah.

Get your paws off of me.

I feel something!

I feel something!

Show some class, Coach.

Nick: Get your paws off of me!

Ow!

Toothpick in my leg! (descending notes)

Oh, dip.

Ernie!

Please apologize to Frondi.

The flautist.

Uh...

The flute player.

Oh.

Sorry, Frondi.

I should go.

We'll take care of the charges and the damages.

We'll spare no expense.

No, we will not. No, we will not.

We will spare no expense.

No, we will not.

So, yeah, I got promoted to Vice Principal.

VP.

Great.

I have a bottle of soy sauce on my desk, so no more packets for me.

Hey, you got a little roly poly bug on you, hmm?

Oh...

I get it.

What?

I wasn't born yesterday!

You think we're on a walk of shame.

Didn't, but...

Congratulations.

You spend your Sundays having cupcake parties at your beautiful house with your cute little half-Asian kid and your daddy diaper bag...

I think someone might need a visit from the "rest police."

Just because I don't have a husband or a baby or a house doesn't mean I'm not living right.

We're still growing and changing.

Yeah.

And that's a good thing.

Look at this hair.

This is single-girl hair.

This is adventure hair.

This isn't boring, married, settled hair.

This is... this is fun.

We're fun.

You know what I did last night?

I got totally obliterated, and I made up a musical fable with a guy named Bear Claw, and it was better than sex.

♪ I'm a little fox, but I'm not that sly ♪
♪ What can I say? ♪
♪ I'm an honest little guy. ♪

Well, I'm glad things are good...

You know what, Genzlinger?

I don't care what you think of me.

'Cause this is my journey.

Welcome to my freaking journey.

Great, I wish you luck...

You ready?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

That's not Jenn.

(sighs)

Nope.

This is not my house, okay?

This is not a daddy diaper bag, This is a bag of sadness.

Because I am a party clown. (squeaks)

I'm actually a musical party clown, okay?

So no one's had a more shameful walk this morning than me.

(squeaks)

What happened to Jenn?

Thanks for bringing that up.

Salt in the wound.

She left me.

You know what I did last night?

I'm gonna tell you.

I masturbated to p*rn that I had to draw on the back of an envelope.

(chuckles) Mmm.

He's great with kids.

Who are you?

I'm a Liza Minnelli impersonator.

♪ Ah... ♪

So...

Ah, guys, look, I don't see much of the toothpick coming out.

So, best move...

Push it all the way in, and get it from the other side.

Am I right? You guys agree?

How could you guys do this to me?

Nick: We didn't do anything.

You embarrassed yourself.

Actually, you embarrassed us.

And you do it all the time, Coach.

Like how you sit on the hood of your car when you pump gas into it.

I mean, what, are you in Dukes of Hazzard, you idiot?

I saw Isaiah Thomas do it on a poster once, and it was cool.

And what are you laughing at, all right?

What?

You put ChapStick on like a little girl putting on lipstick for the first time.

(chuckling): It's way too much puckering.

Winston, you know what, you shut up.

Cold busted.

You're the most embarrassing one of our friends by far.

With your singing.

Outfits. - And the crystals.

Your mural.

The mustache. - Your fauxhawk.

Your bell.

Puzzles. - Cat.

FYI... you guys live with the cat, too.

But at least I get to reap the benefits.

(chuckles)

That... (door opens)

Ah.

(chuckling): Oh, oh.

Look, it's not what it looks like, my man.

Um, we're just trying to squeeze something out of my buddy.

We'll be done when it comes out.

(clicks tongue)

Coach: Well, maybe it's not gonna work with May.

She's too good for me.

I should just go back to having soulless sex with beautiful women I share no emotional connection...

(shouts) Oh!

All my hard work.

May didn't start liking you because you play some dumb instrument.

She started liking you because you're cocky.

And you're funny.

What, you're afraid of her because she plays the standing-up guitar?

He's right, Coach, I don't know why we're trying so hard to make you fit in here.

You're Coach, sex in a sweat suit.

Yeah.

If I've tought you one thing, it's lead out with confidence.

Follow up with comedy.

And number trey, your home run, your triple...

Have great looks.

I got 'em, and I passed them on to you.

So get out there, you beautiful peacock.

Shake your tail feathers.

I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.

Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.

You don't have to clown for these people.

Yes, you do.

She said...

Open yourself up to the journey.

Look, if Taylor Swift can live alone in New York, just think what you can do.

The only thing stopping you is you.

Yeah.

Ma'am, I will not clown for you today.

Or any day thereafter.

What are you doing?

I am going on a journey.

This is my freaking journey.

(squeaking)

We're taking back the morning. (whoops)

Jess: Happy birthday to your little one.

May, we run in different circles.

My circle's not even really a circle.

It's more of a swirling mass of idiots.

But, uh, that's me.

Yeah, you didn't have to come back in here to tell me you were an idiot.

No.

What I need to tell you is I like you.

And that, um... and that I hate classical music.

I'm sorry, I do... I hate it.

I mean, there's so many better kinds of music now, it's...

Okay.

Yeah.

But if you're playing it, I want to listen.

'Cause you mean a lot to me.

All right.

I'm gonna play you a song, and if you can name it...

(sighs) then we can give this another sh*t.

If you don't want to do this, just... it's... I'm fine.

(plays Johnny Pearson's "Heavy Action")

That's Monday Night Football!

Yeah, I learned it for you.

All right.

Oh.

Oh, sorry.

That poked me.

Okay.

No, just don't touch it, don't touch it.

Okay, okay, okay.

But okay.

Okay.

Los Angeles! (shoes squeaking)

We are sluts and we are clowns!

But we are not losers!

We are not losers!

Yes!

No, we're adventurers!

Shame, shame, I know your name.

Ah... yo, Nicholas!

Hey, Genzlinger!

I miss you, man!

Great shoes!

Guess what, guys, I'm still here.

Take that, Lyme's disease!

Cecilia, what is that shirt?

"The man, the legend"?

Oh, I think you've met the legend.

Hey, you guys want a ride?!

Yeah!

Nah!

No.

No, we've made it this far.

We're just gonna carry on through.

Yeah, that's right, that's right.

Yeah.

Take that, City of Angels!

For the true angels are we!

Yes!

Charisma, we didn't waste your blow-out!

I know we are having a moment here.

Just take it down a notch.

(elevator dings)

Oh, thank God we made it.

Bear Claw: Uh, Jess.

You forgot your purse.

I didn't look inside.

(whispering): But I did feel around.

Thanks, Bear Claw.

All right, clockwise, honey.

Don't fight it.

Let me make you.

What... is that?

This is the only thing us Miller men know how to make.

And we call it The Sauce.

It stinks.

It doesn't stink.

Fawn is coming over for a midnight fondue supper.

There's no chocolate or cheese on this earth that makes a cube of bread pop like The Sauce.

Your girlfriend's coming over for the first time, and you asked Nick to cook?

True, normally food à la Nick would be less appealing to me than licking the floor of a beach bathroom.

But I want Fawn to have the best, and The Sauce is the best.

Good for you... when you said "Fawn" and then "fondue," I definitely thought you were headed in the direction of...

Step one: fondue.

Step two: do Fawn.

That's not bad.

Yeah, I was, like, "Fondue is Fawn done."

Th-These are all good.

Hey, has anybody heard for Cece?

'Cause she hasn't answered any of my texts, and I'm starting to get worried.

Jess is starting to find your behavior...

"suspicious."

That's a police word.

It's not a police word, Winston.

It's a very common word.

And you know why I'm keeping my distance.

I like Schmidt.

For the second time!

I know how many times.

Ah. Ah.

If you could see my face right now, I'm smiling, and I'm saying, "Ah."

And if Jess finds out, she's gonna want to get involved, and I don't want her involved because there's nothing that she can do.

Look, if you act suspicious, then she's gonna be suspicious, all right?

Look, don't slink your head in the dumps.

You got to raise your hand with the sunshine wh-where people walk, you know?

Because that's what the whole point of the... when the... if you can lead 'em to water, but you can't make a sound, right?

Look, just call her.

Fine, okay, I'll call her.

But... and listen to me, she cannot find out.

Under no circumstance.

Okay, baby.

Look, your secret is safe with me.

That being said, I am not a smooth man.

Yeah, I get that.

Did I do something to piss Cece off?

Oh, Schmidt, you have something on your pants.

Ah! It's a spider!

Jess, why did you do that?

You know how he gets... He turns into a cartoon elephant of yesteryear who just saw a mouse.

Which is offensive in present day 'cause it seems like a gay stereotype they tried to sneak by us.

"Where's my balance ball?

There's a mouse loose in the house."

Where is it? We've got to hunt it down.

We got to have a spiderhunt.

We're not having one of those.

No, dude, no more spiderhunts.

Guys, they're all over me!

This is childish, and you need to get over it.

Jess, would you please? You know this fear comes from a very real place... 1999.

American Pie was sweeping the nation.

And everybody was doing it with pies.

I just happened to accidentally fall asleep right afterwards.

And when I awoke, the dried apple filling was... it just had attracted so many spiders, and they were all over it, and I...

Okay, everyone was doing it with pies?

Well, Y2K was an uncertain time.

I don't know "everyone," Jess.

I might have dabbled.

Fawn can't see me like this.

Fawn won't care.

Jess, I'm embarrassed... for her to see me in this state.

You're fine...

It's embarrassing... just a little spider!

You're fine.

And there it is! I just saw it!

Get off the table.

We'll do the spiderhunt.

Fawn can't see you like this.

There it is!

It's right there... It's licking it's lips.

So I'm finally e-mailing that girl, May.

Nice.

Here's what I got so far.

Mm-hmm.

"Dear May.

Lay down on me."

Well, th-then what?

You met this woman weeks ago... I can't believe you haven't e-mailed her. Just text her.

If I had her number, I would text her.

She gave me her e-mail.

And now I have to write how I feel.

Which is weird, it's like...

I-I like her. Much.

You like her much?

All right.

"Girl, it's warm today.

"Yesterday was warm, too.

Yeah."

Yeah, I'm gonna write, "Yeah."

You're happy about this?

Damn it, no, it doesn't feel right.

Yeah, just hold it down, hold it down.

Okay, you guys know the drill.

We split up into teams, and we hunt this spider.

Why can't we just call an exterminator?

Yes.

They've all blocked Schmidt's calls since the dandelion incident.

It moved like a spider, Nick!

I don't know a Cece.

Yeah, I do. How the hell are you?

Jess, please, hurry up, we're on a hunt!

It could be right above our heads right now.

Hanging from its butt-rope.

Come over.

I can't.

Why not?

Did I do something?

Are we in another purse thing that I don't know about?

No, no, Jess, of course it's not you.

It would just be... an honor.

I'll be right there.

Great, wear shoes that you don't mind getting spider guts on.

Bye.

So... what's going on with Cece?

Well, I had to beg her like a nerd, but she's finally coming over.

Oh, she's coming over.

Yeah.

Good, man.

Took a lot of cajoling.

That's cool.

Normally, it's, like, she'll come over all the time.

But now it's diff... I don't know why that would be the case at all, but that's cool... I respect the decision for her to come over.

Why are you acting weird?

I'm acting weird?

Mm.

Do you know something?

Do...?

You... I'm not a smooth man.

Is she mad at someone?

Ah... no.

No.

No, she's not mad at anyone.

It's the opposite.

Mm.

It's the opposite?

That's not what I said.

You said, "No, no, she's not mad at anyone.

It's the opposite."

I said, "Whoa, whoa.

"Cheese is bad e'ryone.

Let's stop and spit."

The opposite of mad is...

Does she like someone?

What would make you assume that would be...?

I can hear it.

I can hear it building its house.

Building its sticky, deadly house that you can never leave.

Building it.

With its ass.

We're breaking up into two-person teams.

Cece.

Each team has one Smusher and one Jar-Man.

Nick, I'm gonna make you a Smusher since you have to stir.

Hey, am I stirring right now?

Or is my arm still, and the world is stirring?

Coach, you're a Jar-Man.

Mm.

You're with Schmidt.

Cece, with your delicate little hands, you're a born Jar-Man.

Okay.

Which means I need to pair you up with a Smusher.

I smush.

That'd be me.

Smusher for life.

You're such a Jar-Man.

You don't even know you're a Jar-Man, Jar-Man.

Yeah, you are.

You're a born J-man. Come on, Winston.

Uh, Cece.

Yeah.

Before we get started, you want to have a quick Jar-Man strategy session?

A little Jar-Jar strat sesh?

Are you winking or farting?

The only strategy is... find the spider, k*ll the spider, mount the spider's head on top of the roof so all the other spiders know.

All right. And spiderhunt!

Spiderhunt!

Spiderhunt!

You find that thing... you-you make sure that it's done.

That's the plan, that's...

Okay.

Hey, what do you think Jess and Cece are talking about?

Oh, probably that stupid movie theater popcorn machine that Cece wants me to get for the bar.

She keeps haranguing me about it.

"Popcorn machine, popcorn machine."

Look, I don't know what void Cece's trying to fill in her life...

I don't know, either. Why would I know?

You know, I don't know what void she's trying to fill.

It's all she wants to talk about.

Oh.

Stupid movie theater popcorn machine.

I'm like, "Shut up, dude."

You put bologna in your Bolognese?

Where else would it get its name?

Trick question... it gets it from the mayonnaise.

Yeah, yeah.

You got it.

Do you think a good subject line is, "The Inside of You"?

Hey, you know, I bet I could spot this spider a lot better if I was on your shoulders.

Do not ask me again to get on my shoulders.

That's a once-a-year thing, and you already used it on Halloween, when we were ten-foot-tall Ralph Macchio.

Ow! Damn it!

That was cool.

I didn't like that. I could feel your genitals on the back of my neck like an airplane pillow.

Okay, you know what? How about this?

I'm not sure why he did it but I sure am glad that God rearranged the letters in yam to... create something even sweeter.

What?

May.

Oh, May, yeah. Yeah, all right.

Keep going, keep going.

Oh, dear God.

It's left the web to feed.

All right, I'll put that.

Seems like a weird thing to say.

Lots of bars have popcorn machines.

I really think that people would dig it.

They're not that expensive.

And everybody loves fresh popcorn.

Do you like somebody in the loft?

Winston.

Okay, what did he tell you?

He told me you like someone but he won't name names.

Is it Schmidt? Do you like Schmidt again?

No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Absolutely not. No.

Who is it then? Who?

I want to tell you. I want to tell you so, like, so badly... You know me...

I want to tell you so bad, I just, um, I'm very sorry, but I can't.

Right, right, right, right, you can't tell anybody... except freaking Winston!

That slow puzzler!

I know. I'm lower down on the food chain No!

Than Officer Cat Fancy?!

No. No, no, no, no. It's just I know that you would do anything to help me, and in this situation, you know, there's just nothing to be done.

And we both know that you would just want to get involved.

Well, I can stay uninvolved.

I want to tell you, but I can't.

I just can't.

Okay. That's fine. Okay.

That's cool, that's cool. New teams!

You have to tell me who she likes.

There are no secrets between Jar-Man and Smusher.

Please!

She's my best friend. You have to tell me.

Okay.

Look, Jess... she likes me.

It's me she wants.

Not even for a second.

I thought I was convincing.

Yeah.

I need you to close your eyes and taste it.

Okay.

Oh... Oh, Nick... It's legit terrible.

Well, you taste for texture not taste you big old...

Not really what I was looking for at this stage.

Definitely affects my confidence.

Wait. Wait!

The only person that Cece could like that she wouldn't want to tell me about... is Nick!

Uh...

Does Cece like Nick?

Does Cece like...?

Oh, my...

No... you guessed it.

How you did that?

Oh, my God. My ex-boyfriend and my best friend?

I feel like... Brenda when Kelly dated Dylan!

Or the other way around.

Now I know those are the characters from the original 90210.

But that's about my ceiling. Dylan... was his nickname the Peach Pit? 'Cause I remember...

I remember that being a whole thing.

I'm sorry, I'm a little wound up.

You should be wound up because the Peach Pit used to be yours, but now Brenda want a slice.

Everybody trying to get a slice of that Peach Pit.

You have every right to be mad, Jess, but just do it quietly.

You know, just do it on the low, do it in here.

30 seconds, and you haven't brought up the popcorn machine.

Yeah, well, I guess I'm just gonna have to drop it.

You know, even Jess didn't want to hear about it, and she'll listen to Schmidt discussing Andy Cohen discussing Bethenny discussing NeNe.

Well, great, I'm glad that's behind us.

Yeah.

Now let's never speak of popcorn machines again.


Cece and Nick?

Cece likes Nick?

Cece likes Nick?!

I mean, I guess I understand it 'cause they're at the bar together and once you start sharing tips, where does the sharing end?

Look... Jess, it's not that big of a deal.

Because we all just cats and dogs at the end of the day.

What about Schmidt? Schmidt's Nick's best friend, and Schmidt and Cece have a history.

Look at the memory on you.

I'm gonna have to help Schmidt through this.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Look, Jess, you can't talk to Schmidt about Cece liking Nick.

Come on.

No, you're right. I have to talk to Cece first.

Right, you got to talk to Ce... No, wait, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jess, you can't talk to Cece because Cece, you know, and Nick, they just won't work. 'Cause I was talking to Nick.

He said, "Winston." I was like, "What's up, Nick?" He said...

What?

He said she ugly.

He said what?!

Yeah, he said she look like a dang ol' meatball with hair.

New teams!

You know who's great?

Cece. One of our finest.

Lovely woman.

And she has so much to offer.

Is that what this is about?

She sends you to sell me on it?

No, Nick. She doesn't know I'm talking to you at all. Wait.

You guys have talked about it?

All the time.

But I thought she and I had come to a decision.

Which is?

It's not happening.

Well, why not? 'Cause I'm not interested.

And I know it's not cool to say, but...

I don't like the way it would look.

People are gonna say what they're gonna say. They're not reasons not to go through with it.

Fine. You want to know my biggest concern?

My biggest concern is the smell.

The smell?

The smell of it.

Yeah, and it's not Cece's fault.

I mean, they all smell. I've told her that.

You told Cece you think all women...

Don't make this a feminist thing...

It... I'm not making it a feminist thing.

How? They smell terrible. It's common knowledge.

I thought your biggest concern would be how it affected the people around you.

I mean, sure, a bunch of old drunks will grab at it...

But if your biggest concern is the smell, I'm sure that's highly manageable.

Yeah, I guess there's, like, special solvents and soaps.

I-I haven't read up on it that much.

You know, but you got to really get in there and scrub it out.

It's disgusting.

You know, 'cause of the daily wear and tear and... oil and grease just cooking in there.

It's enough to make a man barf thinking about it.

I mean, they get really hot.

I know what temperature it gets.

Hot.. But if I'm being honest, you know... And I haven't talked to her about this... but... I do have good memories associated with the smell.

Ball games, the circus, hanging with my dad.

Listen here, you idiot. I've known Cece a very long time, and I can promise you the smell will not be a problem.

That's really easy for you to say 'cause you're not the one who's gonna have to remind her to clean it all the time.

I promise you, if it becomes a problem...

I will remind her.

Well, if you remind her and she doesn't do it, I don't want you sneaking around and cleaning it yourself.

Nick.

I'm a good friend, but I am not that good of a friend.

"...that a dream house is a house, but a dreamboat is a person."

I mean, it does speak to the soul.

Hey, what are these? I've always wondered.

Those are grapes.

Uh, they're our glass grapes, bro.

Grapes?

Brings the whole, like, room together.

What the hell they doing in the loft?

Cece, um, do ladies have loins?

You know, it's like I've never looked around this house before.

Skimboards, a boxing glove.

Who in this loft has been to a single Coachella, let alone six of them?

Don't tell Cece that we talked.

She doesn't want me getting involved.

Of course she does, she just didn't think you were into the idea, okay?

She really values your opinion.

What if you guys had a r... a r-real talk?

You know, outside of the bar.

All right.

We'll talk, just the two of us, outside the bar.

I'm proud of you, Nick.

Just make sure she makes her case about facts and figures.

And no more of this, "Come on, Nick, it tastes so yummy" crap.

New teams!

♪ I want to do something freaky to you... ♪

No one can resist my "Get Frisky" playlist, guys.

Just give in.

Give in.

I support it.

"To whom it may concern."

That's good.

I like that.

Wait a minute, is your e-mail address owwMeSoErnie@coolidge?

Still?

Yeah, man. Picked it in college.

It's just gonna follow me from job to job, ISP to ISP.

We've been everywhere together, brotha.

Never done .org or a .gov.

Oh.

I would never do that.

Right.

But every other damn domain.

You can't e-mail a girl like May from an e-mail address like owwMeSoErnie.

Although, you did got a job at a school, so, what do I know?

I must really like this girl, huh?

Okay, it says here, we need "a m*rder of peppercorn," and a... and "some of that flat Jew bread"?

Miller family!

m*rder is over there. it could be something really beautiful, and you-you won't know unless you try.

Okay! Jess!

You don't have to trap me in your room.

We will, on a trial basis, rent a popcorn machine.

Okay?

Something's wrong with my Sauce.

My Sauce!

Hey.

Hey.

You...?

I...

With him?

Winston.

Wh-Where'd it go?

How long has this been unstirred?!

40 seconds. 45 tops.

Is it 40 or 45?

Spider!

Schmidt! Schmidt!

Whoa!

Come on, man!

No! Aah!

Hey! Hey!

Hey, it's gone.

Get him!

It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. It can't hurt you.

It can't hurt you.

Where is... where is the body?!

He was headed straight for The Sauce!

Can you imagine how powerful that spider would've become had he entered my Sauce?

Did I break it?

You sent all 15 drafts of my e-mail to May.

She's gonna think I'm crazy.

Way I see it, we got two options.

All right, well, what are the two options, man?

I mean, you know, just, you got to just dive in, you know?

No, you don't have any options. I don't have any options.

Sometimes you don't have to talk.

I'm really sorry, Coach.

I-I'll make it up to you.

But the good news is, is we got that spider, huh?

Don't have to worry about that thing anymore.

What? What are you guys trying to tell me?

So, it is Schmidt?

Yeah.

I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but...

No, it's okay. It's okay.

Look, I promise I won't tell him.

Nobody's gonna tell him.

Okay.

Hey, somebody tell him.

You tell him, but easy.

Tell him. I don't want to tell him, dude. You tell him.

We're all his best friends. Tell him.

I think I'm pretty good with it now.

Hey, Schmidt, I...

I mean, spiders and all.

Tell him!

I don't want to tell him.

Somebody just tell him!

Guys, just tell me.

You're being so dramatic right now.

You have a spider on your face.

What are you talking about?

I touched it!

Get it off!

Okay. - Oh!

Don't touch me!

Don't touch me! Get it off! Get it off of me!

Get it away from me! Get it off!

Get it off!

Hey, hey, the spider.

Get it off! Don't touch!

Hello.

Don't touch! Get it off of me!

Get it...!

Schmidt.

Hold still.

Aah!

Oh! Oh!

Oh...

Ah!

What's up now, spider?

Vote Moscato!

Well, it can't hear you.

But, seriously, vote Moscato.

So, that guy, huh?

Yeah. Can you blame me?

He's perfect.

And when is dinner?

Is it, um...?

The Sauce! Sauce.

The Sauce.

Yeah. 'Cause Fawn's hungry. My e-mails.

I'm about to pick you up with a tissue like you wouldn't believe!

So, what's the plan?

Jess. I'm gonna pick you up with a tissue so hard!

He's happy. He has a girlfriend.

Yeah, spi-spider!

I know, but it's you, and Fawn kind of scares me.

Let this be a warning to all your other little, uh, spider friends hiding out, too.

I know that would do anything for anybody, but right now, I just need you to... be there for me and hold my hand, okay?

That's all.

Little half-insects, half-lobsters.

Ah...

I really want to do something.

Don't go up the spout if you can't handle the rain, s-spider!

Okay, well, you've done it.

The perfect burn of the d*ad bug.

Yeah, that's right.

Now stop. : Okay.

The Sauce is shockingly great.

This tastes like the inside of a bear, and that is a compliment, my friend.

All right.

I... Oh.

Oh. May responded to my e-mails.

"I appreciate how much effort you put into these.

I'd love to go out."

Hey.

Great.

All right.

There you go.

Yeah!

Uh, you're welcome.

This is great guys, right?

To Fawn.

Oh.

A woman who likes me not in spite, but because of my flaws.

I do like you.

But I hate your flaws.

And to all my friends.

In the spiderhunt of life...

I sure am glad that we're a team of six.

Cheers!

Hey! Hey!

To those who...

Okay. No, that's good.

And thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.

All right, here we go.

Ow.

Oh.

Yeah, sweep the leg, Johnny.





The guys and I are about to leave for the airport, and I'm so excited to see you.

Is that Ryan?

I can't wait for you to see my hometown.

It's going to be just like An Affair to Remember, only instead of the Empire State Building on New Year's Eve, it's going to be a winery near the Portland airport at my dad's wedding.

Anyway, I love you, I miss you.

(Schmidt groans)

Hello? Hello?

Sounds like I lost you for a minute!

(chuckles)

Are you there?!

Where's my widdle Eng-wish man?

And with that, Ryan walked into the River Thames and accepted death.

The joke's on you, 'cause I wasn't even talking to him.

I was leaving a voice mail.

Haven't talked to him for a week.

Are you guys making a group face?

No, we're not...

No.

Nah.

Guys, look, Ryan and I are great.

Really? 'Cause he doesn't call enough.

And when he does, it's in the middle of the night.

Ryan didn't want to move to England, he had to move to England.

For the last couple of weeks, you've been keeping Nick hours, and... and it's ugly.

Hey. Sorry.

I was talking to Ryan before he went to work and I must have fallen asleep.

Friend to friend, am I wearing pants?

The situation isn't ideal, however, long distance is super romantic.

Plus I don't have to shave my legs every day which is a real plus.

You know, Fawn shaves herself from toe to chin.

Every single day.

God, I love my girlfriend.

Hey. Oh, Cece.

Cece: Yeah, what? Huge news.

Jake Apex is coming to the wedding.

Jake Apex?

Who is Jake Apex?

Jake Apex is Cece's high school crush.

Never did anything for me, but turned Cece to soup.

Thanks.

Mm. Yeah.

Is he one of them Portland hippies?

'Cause I hate them Portland hippies.

Cece: He is a legend.

Every time I spoke to him, I'd have a full-bl*wn tiny kid stroke.

Hey, k*ller.

I... d... uh... mm...

(sputters)

Yeah, well, I got a bad feeling about this guy.

Why, because he's b*mb and Cece wants some?

No. Other reasons.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go water my succulents.

How do you know Apex is so cute?

I just assumed.

Winston, stop with the look, okay?

Otherwise I will m*rder you and clean up your blood with your cat.

All right? For the 50th time, I do not like Schmidt.

Good luck finding my cat.

You know, I haven't seen him in weeks.

My best man suit.

Oh.

I'm my dad's best man.

He wanted a boy. My middle name's Christopher.

Yeah.

♪ You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage ♪
♪ I can't stand it, I know you planned it ♪
♪ I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate... ♪

The Co-Pays are awesome.

I can't believe they're also pharmacists.

♪ What could it be? It's a mirage ♪
♪ You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage. ♪

Man: That's really good.

(applauding, whooping)

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

This is a nice place.

I mean, it's not the best vineyard in Portland.

Here we go.

That's Bartleby Cellars, of course.

How would you even know that?

Whenever Coach goes to a new city, he learns all about it, like a real weirdo.

I was an army brat, all right?

I moved a lot. Assimilating was key.

Oh, and by the way, calling somebody weird in Portland is actually a compliment, so thank you, Nick.

Hey, oh.

It's just... Oh.

Sorry, I thought I heard my phone ringing.

Ryan's supposed to call me before he gets on the plane.

Oh! Sorry.

Jess, just take your phone out.

No, Nick, I want to be here with you guys.

I want to... Sorry.

I just want to...

Sorry.

Does anybody else hear buzzing?

No.

No, 'cause it's not buzzing.

No, honey, but, you know, he's going to be here soon, okay?

Yeah.

Are you guys still touring the city?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I made about 12 drafts of this map.

Couldn't figure out where to go.

Had to fit 18 years into one morning.

So, here it is.

Aw. I'm so excited to show him Portland, and my mom is so excited to meet him.

And I'm going to show him...

Jess, it's not buzzing.

It's not buzzing.

I promise you it's not.

It's not buzzing.

Oh, there's my dad.

Hey, guys.

Sounded great. You sounded great.

You look terrific, too.

Hey!

Oh, there's my daughter.

Oh...

I thought we talked about you not calling me that.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, how's the food?

I haven't eaten in three weeks.

Trying to fit into my wedding dress.

(laughs)

Had a dream about a crouton last night.

And, um...

And that was the whole dream.

Ooh, before I forget, best man.

(chuckles) Aw.

The wedding rings.

Hey, I want you to meet a bunch of relatives that are all going to be d*ad in a couple of years.

Oh, good idea.

Oh.

Hey, what happened to the British guy?

He's coming tomorrow.

Man: Hey, Jake.

Jake Apex. That's him. That's him right there.

Winston: I will say one thing about that man that I've only said about Ryan Gosling... hot damn!

What's up, Winston?

I'm gonna just go...

I'm gonna go talk to him, yeah.

Winston: You're good.

Yup.

You're okay.

Gonna...

I didn't know that was a thing. You...

Okay.

(inaudible)

Schmidt: Oh, this is very hard to watch.

It's like when Bob Costas had that eye infection at the O-Lympics.

You mean the Olympics.

(Cece laughing hard)

(whoops)

Okay. Oh, God.

Okay, what happened?

Did I look cool?

Uh...

Define "cool."

What happened? I don't know what hap... I blacked out.

Okay, look, Cece...

I'm gonna help you.

I'm Usher, you're Bieber.

And Jake Apex is all the hot tracks that we're going to make together.

Hey.

Hey.

So, um... Ryan's not coming.

Oh, boy.

He has to work on Monday and he thought, ultimately, it didn't make sense, which makes sense.

It's not a big deal.

But the tour's canceled.

(in Southern accent): Hey, Randy, the tour's canceled.

(in normal voice): I don't know why I did that.

Anyway, go ahead, Nick. Go ahead.

Talk about how much this sucks.

Tell me that Ryan's not coming 'cause he's a blank who's a blank.

I do have one thing to say.

While you were away, we were all talking about how much we wanted to go on the tour.

So don't cancel it. We'll do it with you!

Really?

Yeah!

Yeah!

Yes!

Really?

Yes!

Fired up.

We haven't stopped talking about...

Yeah, man.

Couldn't be more excited.

All 18 places!

There's 18?

Wow.

I'm going to add a few more stops, then.

I definitely know you'd enjoy the Shakespeare Garden.

Ha-ha, great.

Guys, Jess says she's fine, but I know she's not.

Okay? She needs cheering up.

We're in her hometown.

I can't believe Ryan bailed.

I'm not happy with what Ryan's doing.

It's, it's not cool.

But today, it's all sunshine and smiles.

Hey, hey, hey, hey... Let me, let me get sunshine.

Let me get sunshine.

Okay, yeah, you can be sunshine.

Yes! (laughs)

Here she is... Sunshine and smiles!

(all cheering)

Jess!

Winston: Sending the sun in!

Hi.

So... I'm sorry this is so small.

It was just meant for Ryan and me.

No worries.

No problem. - It's great.

Your shoes look super-cute.

You look great.

You look great.

Let's see if... Ryan...

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Give me that purse! No more checking in with Ryan.

The tour starts now.

(all cheering)

Jess: And there's the Italian soda shop where I first learning what a "not" joke was.

Not!

I... I learned it, actually, in the candle shop, next-door.

People don't really do "not" jokes anymore.

Not! They'll be in forever!

Right, guys?

Not!

(laughs)

Jess: And there's the dance studio where I had my first kiss with the cutest/only boy in my jazz troupe.

Then he came out of the closet... super gay.

Then we kissed some more.

Then he went to Oberlin.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Stop in that store!

I'm going full Portland, people.

I'm so Portland right now, they all staring at me like, "Is that the president of Portland?"

(laughing)

I'm like, "No."

This is the very pizza place where we'd dab our pizzas with our napkins, to get the grease off, and then we'd make this kid named Joey eat the napkins.

(laughing)

I'm not gonna lie... (forced laugh)

I'm Joey.

Hmm.

(gasping): Oh, my God.

Cece: Oh, no, he's here.

He's here. He just walked in.

Oh, is he a firefighter?

Seems pretty easy in Portland, huh?

(chuckles) Rain just does the work for you.

Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

No! Do... do not go and talk to him.

Do not go and talk to him.

Cece, not everything's about you, you narcissist.

All right, just... go to the bathroom, like you said you'd...

And... he's talking to him.

Just don't look. Just don't look. Oh, well, he's looking at you.

What? What? Really?

No, like, right now, he's staring at you.

Don't, don't, don't, don't look, don't look.

Don't look. The cutest one's looking right at me.

I don't see a "cute" or "not cute" one, Coach.

If you had to choose, which one's the cutest?

Way to the left.

(whispering): I'm super nervous.

Now my hands are sweating.

Then wipe 'em off.

If he comes over and shakes your hand, you don't want sweaty hands.

Oh, my God!

Schmidt: He said he thinks you're cute.

Cece: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Jess: Hey, Nick, can I have my phone?

You know what? Never mind. I don't care.

So this is my childhood home, the place of my birth.

Thank you guys so much for doing this, and coming on this tour with me.

I forgot all about...

(with British accent): Hello, hello, hello, darling!

("God Save the Queen" playing)


Where's the famous Mr. Geauxinue?

Jess: Um... well... actually, um, Ryan... had to cancel last-minute, so he's not coming.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, honey... that's just awful.

Aw...

Damn men.

Oh, I feel so bad for you.

Hey, Mom... Mom... Oh, honey...

Um... don't get emotional, okay?

'Cause if you get emotional, I'll get emotional.

Let's talk about happy stuff.

Did you guys see the video of the panda farting and falling of a branch?

(everyone laughing)

Pretty crazy, man.

It was funny. It was funny.

Winston: It made me laugh.

Who wants scramblies?

You know I do, Mom.

(voice breaking): Good.

(crying)

Look, this might not be the right time to say this, you guys, but, uh, should we take a straw poll on this whole Cosby thing?

Jess: I just want to clarify to everyone here that I am fine.

Which is why I'm fine.

Great!

Yeah.

Finer than fine.

Mm-hmm.

Coach: Which is why I'm fine.

Schmidt: Fantastic!

Cece: I'm fine, too. Everybody's great.

Schmidt: Perfect.

(stifled crying)

I'm not fine!

Nick: I can't do this anymore.

It's not all smiles and sunshine.

It's not!

Look, Ryan bailed and that's a dick move.

And that's the truth.

(crying): I'm fine, I'm just gonna go to my room.

(crying): I made scones.

(door slams)

Was that sunshine or smiles? Hmm?

(rock music blaring)

Oh...

Joanie... (chuckles)

I don't want to lie to you, so I'm not...

There's shells all in these eggs.

So, Joan, how do you, uh, feel about Bob getting remarried?

Mm! Oh, I'm fine.

I just feel bad for Ashley.

I mean, let's just say he's a man with a healthy appetite, except one thing.

(coughing)

Well, that's a visual.

I don't really have a burning desire to stick around for the wedding, so I'm going on a trip with some friends.

Hmm!

A trip I've never taken before.

Hmm!

(rock music blaring)

Hey! You mind if I turn this down?

(volume decreases)

"AP Stat Jams."

Advanced Placement.

Very smart.

How many Lilith Fairs did you go to?

Oh, Method Man performed at that one?

It's Liliths Fair.

Like "passersby..." or "attorneys general."

Well, look, I came to, uh... give you this.

Text Ryan as much as you want, it's none of my business.

I just think long-distance relationships suck.

I once broke up with a woman who lived in Irvine, and that's only 30 minutes away.

Mind you, I had hornets living in my car at the time, which was a factor, but the commute was also a big part of it.

Well, look, Nick, we're different, and just because it's difficult with Ryan, doesn't mean we're doomed.

We're star-crossed lovers.

We're like Kate and Leo... or... Claire and Leo, or... whatever blonde Leo is taking on boats.

They're all doomed.

Leo ain't gonna settle down... He ain't ready.

I'm a hopeless romantic, and I always have been.

Which is why...

I mean, it's a nice notion, it's just... from 1994 to 2001, I believed that Jordan Catalano was gonna show up in my driveway after a dirt bike accident, all scruffy and... beautiful... and he would need a bath and some... medical attention.

You think that little boy is driving a dirt bike?

He looks a lot like you.

That's me, that's Jordan Catalano.

I honestly couldn't tell the difference.

I swear to God. I'm not trying to be mean.

You know what the problem with Jordan Catalano is?

Yeah... an undiagnosed learning disability.

Oh, I didn't know the boy had mental problems...

I wouldn't be teasing him, but...

No, it's that he's fake.

The only thing that matters is if the guy is there for you when you need him.

Otherwise, you're dating a wall.

I have to get to my dad's wedding. I didn't...

I didn't come in here trying to be harsh, I'm ju...

I was trying to be helpful and it's not working and I apologize.

I was coming in as a friend, Je...

I'm sure that's just her.

Well, the dream's d*ad.

Apparently, Jake Apex has to work, so he's not gonna come to the wedding.

I'm wearing the craziest underwear for nothing.

Okay, look, Cece, you know what we do? We regroup.

No, it's fine, Schmidt. I'm over it.

It is not fine.

Look, Cece, you're the most amazing woman I ever met.

If you want Jake Apex, I'm gonna help you get Jake Apex.

I'm never gonna stop trying to make you happy, Cece.

I promise you, for the rest of my...

(phone ringing)

Oh, look at that, it's Fawn.

Hello, Councilwoman Moscato.

(quietly): Oh, yeah.

(panting): Guys!

I forgot the rings at the house.

They're in my purse in my room.

And now I have to go get my dad ready.

Apparently, he's wearing some kind of a male corset.

All right, Coach and I will get the rings...

You don't have a car.

All right. Okay.

Wait!

All right.

Let's do this.

(chuckles): Yeah.

Okay. Okay.

Okay, ready?

Yep, yep.

Go easy. I'm not on!

You're not?!

I'm not on! I'm not on!

You don't have the rings?!

Well, Dad, hold on...

You don't have the rings?!

Oh! Damn it, no! That's...

No, this is bad.

We're doomed!

You look beautiful, but we are doomed.

(groans)

Oh, yeah.

(sighs)

I wish these were filled with ground beef.

(ringtone playing)

Oh, wait, this is Nick! Nick's calling!

He's probably walking in the door. Here.

Hey.

I found the purse, but your mom has the rings.

What? (chuckles)

Can you ask her for them?

Yeah, it's a little hard right now.

Remember she said she was going on a trip?

(women laughing, howling)

It's gonna be a hair longer.

It's acid, isn't it?

What is taking them so long?

(laughs): Hi!

Um... so the wedding will begin shortly.

(crowd sighs) But first, I'm gonna start you off with a crowd-pleasing, nondenominational...

Something in it for everyone... (chuckles)

"Ave Maria."

♪ Ah... ♪

(continues holding note)

♪ Ve... ♪

(continues holding note)

Joan, I need you to focus.

I need you to help me find those rings. (grunts)

We have the rings.

They all... all of you... We all have the rings.

Everyone's got the ring. Come into the womb.

Come into the womb.

I don't want to come in the womb.

Come into the womb.

I'm not a womb guy! I'm not a womb guy!

♪ Mari... ♪

(continues holding note)

Show me the rings!

The womb.

Can I just see that?

Reverse. Birth.

That's not it.

WOMEN (chanting): Reverse. Birth.

Here we go!

This is a real Portland experience!

Ah, hippie hair in my mouth!

Hippie hair in my mouth!

(squeaking chatter)

And with that message from Beaker, all of the Muppets have wished Bob and Ashley a very happy wedding.

(growling voice): Except for me.

(normal voice): Cookie Monster, is that you?

Now, I understand, Cookie Monster, you've got a very special song to sing for us.

(growling voice): Yes, I do!

(f*re alarm wailing)

There are a lot of ways to stall a wedding, okay?

And you just happened to...

Go talk to him.

Yeah. Talk to the guy you like.

Hey, k*ller.

Hey, so, uh...

I'd love to see you again before you leave.

To be honest with you, Cece, I've always had a crush on you.

Oh, God.

Okay, so I've never said this out loud before, but...

I'm... in love with someone else.

It's kind of complicated because he has a girlfriend, so I can't tell anybody.

I mean, Winston knows, but you, you don't know Winston.

I got to get back to the truck soon.

Power steering's out again.

I'm the only one strong enough to drive it.

Of course.

But, uh, I guess I'll see you around.

Yeah, I guess.

(bicycle bell dings)

Okay, okay.

Got it.

Oh, my God! Thank God you guys are here!

Is my mom okay? (both panting)

It's actually really hard riding one of these bikes; it's super tiring.

I don't have a watch on.

I don't know why I'm doing that.

Dad, I...

(Bob humming music)

(continues humming)

Aren't they cute?

Cute as a mute.

That's a thing.

People-people say that.

(sighs)

Love is never what you think it's gonna be, is it?

No, it isn't.

Hey, Nick... you were right.

He should've been here.

I need a guy who shows up.

'Cause anything else just isn't real.

Jess, you should, uh, know something, too.

I touched both your mother's breasts in a communal womb earlier today.

I didn't do it on purpose, but there it is.

Thanks for telling me. I appreciate it.

It's a relief to get it off my shoulders.

Thanks for being cool about it.

I'll leave you alone.

(continues humming)

Wait, what?

I didn't read about this place.

That's because it's not in any guidebook, Tagliaboo.

It is called Crush Pond.

At least that's what Jess and I used to call it.

We used to come down here when she liked somebody.

We'd throw a rock in the pond, and we'd wish that they liked her back.

Huh.

I'd sit over there and smoke cloves while she did that.

I broke up with Ryan.

Wow.

Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

How'd he take it?

Actually, pretty good.

So you got his voice mail.

Yeah.

Sounds about right.

Last stop on the tour.

Um... it's Crush Pond.

So... say a name in your head and throw the rock in the pond, and they'll love you forever.

Um, and for the record, that's actually never worked.

(laughs)

So we're gonna do it anyways?

Jess: Yeah.

We're really gonna do this?

I got a big one.

(singsongy): I know who your rock is for.

Winston, you better shut up before I knock that fade right off your head.

(chuckles): You don't know me like that, Cece. I swear...

Oh, I know you like that, trust me.

Swear to God...

Uh, I'm gonna say Detroit Pistons.

You're not getting it, man.

What-what is it?

You got to say, like, a lady's name.

Oh.

Gladys.

A lady you know.

Oh.

To whoever you are, can't wait to meet you.

And I hope you live close by.

Three, two, one.





(British accent): Hello!

Hey.

Hi.

Happy St. Valentine's Day, mates.

I just spent the week at Ryan's, and it was absolutely lovely.

Coach: Fake accent, smug attitude... This is exactly why the teachers have turned on Jyan.

Jyan?! Come on!

You chose the worst parts of both our names.

That's why we chose it. Haters gonna "H."

That's why Ryan has to find a new job.

You know, I hear Elijah Wood's looking for a stunt double.

(laughter)

He's so small!

Get back in that tree and make me some cookies, Ryan! Cookies!

Yeah!

I know, so hot, right?

Anyway, what's going on in your little lives?

Well, I'm just enjoying the fruits of dating a semi-powerful local politician.

Tonight, it's a Valentine's Day cardiologists' soiree.

Check that out.

Oh!

Oh, my goodness. Is that the invitation?

Wait, that's a real heart? Looks like meat.

It's not shaped like this?

Yeah, well, you know, the cardiologists feel that the traditional cartoon heart, uh... promotes ignorance.

That's gross.

Where's Nick? How is he handling the breakup with Kai?

I don't know... I haven't seen Fat Fat Fatty in a long time.

Yeah, me, either.

Yeah, I haven't seen him since the breakup.

You live in the same room as him.

I've been crashing in your room while you're away.

Is Nick missing?

No, he is not.

Oh, boy.

(chuckling): Hey.

Schmidt: Oh, wow. COACH: You look terrible.

Hey, Nick. Are you covered in gravy?

Nope. I've been in my room for the last week sleeping and thinking and really getting into the comic strip Cathy.

Oh, I'm really excited that we can finally talk about Cathy.

When she's mad, she says, "Ack."

Ack.

Ack.

Ack!

Nick, why would you come out here?

Sounds like you were doing pretty good in there.

Doug's Ale House.

The new bar on Sixth and Spring?

No.

The exact coordinates to complete my bar crawl that I've been working on for almost a decade.

Mmm.

What?! - Ooh.

Schmidt: Big day.

Thanks.

And guess what? Good news.

(imitates drumroll)

It's tonight! Who's in?

Oh...

Winston: You know, I'm on call at the station tonight, so I can't really drink, so...

Fawn's speaking at a cardiologist event.

Ryan and I have a reservation at a really fancy restaurant, so...

You're probably thinking,

"Oh, a bar crawl on Valentine's Day...

Is this about Nick's breakup with Kai?" No.

Yeah.

Now you might be asking yourself,

"Is attendance really mandatory?"

You bet it is.

Bar crawl!

Hmm...

He's about to cr*ck. We have to go tonight.

So I have news about a bar Cr...

Was I just out here talking to you guys about the bar crawl?

Did I already pitch it all to you?

Well, it's happening tonight!

Okay, so we h*t six bars in five hours.

Wait, wouldn't six hours make more sense?

Yeah, that'd make sense 'cause it all divides...

No, no, it doesn't, because it's... it's five hours.

Now, the amazing thing is, if you connect all the coordinates, the six bars form a perfect smiley face on the map... look.

You didn't actually connect all the coordinates.

Oh, my...

Winston: Hey, I think it is a really cool smiley face.

Thank you.

I got your back, man. I got your back.

Actually, I have all your backs, all right?

Uh, since I can't drink tonight, I am your designated buddy.

Here in my backpack, I have a list of items that we may need.

I got water, so...

I got towels for everybody.

Perfect.

I got... small stick.

Speaks for itself.

Oh.

Oh. Also... one female condom.

It's gonna go quick, so I'll let you two fight it out.

Cece: Uh-uh. Also, I got tissues for you, Nick, 'cause...

What for?

It's-it's Valentine's Day, and your girlfriend broke up.

You guys can be sad...

Move it right along, man.

Cool it. And the bar crawl starts... now!

Now!

(all cheering and whooping)

Actually, where's Schmidt?

Well, it's with a heavy heart...

(laughing): Oh! that we really must leave you.

We really must. He's too much. It was a pleasure.

Pleasure.

Easy on the puns, okay?

And you've got broccoli in your teeth.

Remember what I told you about eating at public functions?

Only use your back teeth.

Only use your back teeth.

Hey, Fawn, I'm sorry. We should probably get to Nick's bar crawl now, yeah?

You remember? I confirmed it like ten times with your intern.

Yes, yes, yes, no.

First, I need to, uh, schmooze some vascular surgeons.

Gotta get a discount on my spider vein removal. Okay?

Okay, ten minutes tops.

We're still going to dinner, 'cause it took a lot to get this reservation.

Also, we can't get wasted 'cause it's a very nice restaurant.

Which means we have to pretend to drink in front of Nick.

Is that really necessary?

Oh, yakkety-yakkety-yak.

Don't ruin my bar crawl.

Let's go. Drink.

Mmm.

Mmm.

Mmm, mmm.

Boom!

I'm gonna outdrink you tonight, Miller.

Cece, your mouth is writing a check that your body can't find. (Winston laughs)

That's not an expression.

Regionally specific to Northern Illinois.

We say it all the time.

Thank you, Winston.

You're welcome.

Don't write a check your body can't find.

(laughs) Every day, man.

For real.

Got to. Got to.

A gimlet for May.

Thank you.

Watch and learn, player.

If you're a girl and you're in a bar on Valentine's Day, you're basically saying, "Hello. Good February.

I'm interested in casual sex."

(chuckles) Hmm.

May, huh?

That's your name?

Yeah.

Ah, that's crazy 'cause, uh... (coughing loudly)

(clears throat, groans)

I know I just met you, but your name's already written... on my heart.

It's fate, baby.

It's fate... seriously?

Nick: All right, come on! Five-minute warning, let's go.

Dude, I'm kind of in the middle of something.

Oh, no, nope, you're in the middle of nothing, because that's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.

(chuckles) She hates you, Ernie.

But I don't like her for you, anyway. Let's go.

Wait, what do you mean?

Ryan: I just don't know what to do. No schools are hiring.

I've contacted everyone I know.

I even checked through all my contacts in England, including my old headmaster at Wellington Prep, to see if he knew of anything in the States.

♪ Where there's a will, there's a ♪
♪ Wellington way. ♪ (giggles)

How do you know the Wellington fight song?

You sing it in your sleep.

Oh, God.

Look, don't worry, you're gonna find a job.

I'm just worried about not seeing you as much if I switch schools.

Well...

I'll just have to sleep over more.

Or you could move in with me.

Did the music just get louder?

(Nick whoops) The crawl rolls on and Winston's got the rear!

Let's go!

Cece: Let's go.

(whooping)

Winston: Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Let's go with the backpack in the back of the pack.

Hey, so listen, can't make the crawl. Bummed.

What?

But remember... tomorrow we have that photo sh**t, and I'm gonna need you to look as Mexican as possible, okay?

It's not okay. We should be together.

It's Valentine's Day.

Come on, you don't really care about Valentine's Day, do you?

I don't know, maybe I do.

Plus, you owe me.

I ran the teleprompter at your last debate... I made "Fawn is Fine" bumper stickers on my own dime.

Yeah.

Even krumped at that anti-g*ng initiative.

(hip-hop song playing)

Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that.

Me, too. The point is, Yeah.

I'm tired of always doing your things.

What do you want? You want a... You want a photo op?

Or do you want a boyfriend?

Call me when you know what you want.

Yeah, okay.

♪ ♪

This bar completes the eyes on my smiley face.

Miller, man, it's just an honor to be on this bar crawl with you.

Just serving your vision.

Are you guys going on a bar crawl?

I just got dumped, so this holiday is really kicking me in the penis.

Me, too, man. Me, too.

It's been a real kick in the gooch.

Not anymore, it's not.

'Cause you're joining us.

Valentine's Day might be for couples, but the crawl is for all.

Yes. We just got our motto, folks.

All: The bar crawl is for all!

Good evening, happy Valentine's Day.

May I offer you a piece of my hear...?

Hey.

You again.

I'm curious, d-do you actually think that's gonna work?

I mean, you tell me.

(imitates heart pumping)

Are you trolling bars on Valentine's Day trying to find sad single girls to hook up with you?

I'm not gonna say yes, and I'm not gonna say no.

Because I know it would be a lie.

So yes.

I'm gonna...

I'm gonna take these.

Don't!

Yep.

Paid $3.50 for those.

You owe me $3.50.

I don't know, it's just such a huge step and so early in the relationship, and I thought that I could skip the question and come back to it later, which is the strategy I taught my S.A.T. prep course.

All right, let's do pros and cons.

Okay, pros... I love him.

I love his house, I love his accent.

When he says "raccoon" he says it like "rac-co*n."

Adorable.

Cons...

His toaster is super-old.

Woman: Ugh! I tried to stay out of this, but move in with him!

Yeah, well, I-I want to move in with him, but...

No "but," there's no damn "but."

No "but."

But... what if I blew it by pretending I didn't hear him?

Or maybe it wasn't that obvious.

Nah, she heard me, it was very obvious.

I really hate to see you upset.

You know, if I had something to g...

You know what, I do have something.

I have a bag of nuts in my bag.

Do you want a bag of nuts?

Nick: Maybe she didn't hear you.

You know, she's got a lot of hair.

Mm.

And hair blocks sound.

It happened when we were dating all the time.

Hey, did you get a chance to read my Walking d*ad fan fiction, yet?

What'd you think?

Well, here's the good news, lad.

We have a solution.

It's God's gift to man.

It's alcohol.

I can't.

We agreed to pretend-drink so we could go out to dinner.

Are you saying that 'cause you want me to go to jail for m*rder?

No.

No, 'cause I'm gonna m*rder you if you're pretend-drinking on my bar crawl!

And you're breaking my heart!

You can't fight the crawl.

It's like fighting a hurricane.

You know what a hurricane is?

Do you guys have those over the pond?

We don't, but I know what it is.

You guys don't have them?

No.

They're awful.

Mm-hmm.

It's like fighting one of those.

And a hurricane doesn't have fists, so just, bang, you lose!

Let's drink.

Yeah, man.

Yeah!

USA!

USA!

Yeah! - USA!

USA! (whoops)

And also where you're from!

Mmm.

To show respect.

Well, happy V-Day to me.

Fawn and I are on the rocks.

By the way, a pun that would have k*lled at last week's geologist ball.

(whispering): Let's m*rder her.

What?!

I want chicken wings.

I know.

How many drinks you had tonight?

Nine plus three minus one.

Oh, no. That's...

Because I'm gonna out-drink Miller.

You are gonna out-drink Miller? No one out-drinks Miller.

I do.

I guarantee you, you don't.

You don't know me.

Cece, Nick just got dumped, okay?

He has a depth of anger and sadness that rests between his eyes, and he can drink forever and ever and ever.

You'll lose every time.

Hey, it's my business partner that I was telling you about... Schmidt!

All: Schmidt!

Nick, who are all these people?

These are the crawlers.

The single, the lonely, the close-talkers, the shockingly pale, the t*nk-mouths, fat boys in the back... (whoops twice)

(crawlers whoop twice, in response) The chubby-fronts, the delusionally-okay with themselves... but no one is alone tonight because...

All (chanting): The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all!

I just want chicken wings.

Oh, you're hammered, Cece.


Hey.

Hey, Jess, I'm drinking f*re.

That seems dangerous.

Mm...

Um, I wanted to talk to you about what you said before.

What did I say? I can't remember.

You don't, you don't remember what you said?

No, I embraced the crawl.

Oh.

Winston and Nick: ♪ When it's cold outside ♪

That sounded, that's where we're at.

Come on, now, don't be shy! I see you!

(boos, chuckles)

Oh, no.

Nick: And mic drop. Who's next?

No. What?!

No.

Damn it!

Are you following me?

No, I'm not following you, dude.

Do you have any nicer, sluttier friends?

Yeah, I do, and I'm never introducing them to you.

That's messed up.

And they're real dirty.

Aw!

Can I have a gimlet, please?

I.D.?

Seriously? Why?

'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.

(goofy laughing)

(snickering)

Oh...

(woman sighs) COACH: Ah.

Thank you.

You got a Kansas license.

That's where I learned to drive, and I have an emotional attachment to it, and I don't need to explain that to you.

No, you don't, but...

You're from Kansas?

Yup.

Well, I'm from all over. Army brat.

Me, too.

You are?

Yes.

Uh, you ever lived in North Carolina?

From 1989 to 1992.

I lived there in '93.

No.

You ever live in Germany?

Dusseldorf in '96!

Lived there in '97!

That's so weird.

So, we've, like, just missed each other for our entire lives.

And then we meet, like, three times in a row in one night.

(laughs) Seems a little weird.

It's kind of like, uh...

Fate?

No.

I know! I can't believe I said that!

Why did you say that?

That's so cheesy.

Oh, I hate that!

Nick: Hey, Coach!

Coach!

I don't know them.

I got a female condom if you need it, my man! (whoops)

Don't hold this against me, please.

Cece (groaning): Oh, God...

Here, Cece, have some water.

No, thank you. No.

Valentine's Day just sucks.

I don't know. I kind of like it.

Since when?

Since a few years ago... since three years ago, to be exact.

Oh, what happened three...?

Oh.

It was when you first took a chance on me.

And we humped until the sun came out.

Did all the things that R. Kelly raps about.

Yeah, I know. I was there.

It was the best night of my life, and ever since then, Valentine's Day has always been my favorite holiday, and I hope that you don't remember that I have said any of these things tomorrow.

Oh, it's gonna happen again.

It's gonna... Oh.

It's gonna happen again.

All right.

Oh...

(coughing)

Somehow, this isn't repulsive.

It's not great, but it certainly isn't the worst.

Jess: I'm so sorry that I pretended not to hear you.

It's just that... I wasn't ready for it, and sometimes you mumble with your accent, and I never fully understand you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I asked you to move in with me out of the blue.

What kind of... nutter does that?

The craziest mother nutter in the whole damn place!

Ryan Geauxinue, will you move in with me?

I have my own home.

You live in a loft with four guys and a urinal.

Will you move in with me?

Yes.

Yes?

Yes!

Yes!

Absolutely.

Yes!

Yes!

(giggles)

Nick: Home base! (groans)

Barkeep, bring us beer.

If you call me barkeep one more time, I'm shutting this bitch down.

Mike, I love you because you're gay... and 'cause you're dangerous.

I can't believe I used to have a crush on you.

(groans)

Hey, man. How's it going?

I'm not hooking up tonight.

I met one girl.

Several times.

She's pretty much perfect.

Nice. Where's she at?

I ditched her, dude.

She's, like, relationship material.

That's not what I'm looking for tonight.

Really?

Yeah, I want something easy.

Something easy?

Like Sunday morning.

Like Sunday morning. Know what I'm saying?

I know what you're saying.

That bitch is a Monday.

Know what I'm saying?

You know what's funny?

I got something just for that.

You're gonna love it. Here it is.

I can't wait.

Give it to me right...

Yo!

Go get that girl, dude.

(whining): I don't even know where she is.

I didn't h*t you that hard.

Hey. (grunts)

This, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing?

Yeah.

Not to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.

And I would know.

I have their biography here in my backpack.

I care about Schmidt, but just as a friend, all right?

Look me in the eyes, and tell me you don't have feelings for Schmidt.

I don't have feelings for him.

Dude, you are nowhere near my eyes.

Nobody h*t on me. I'm taken.

Don't talk to me. I'm a councilwoman.

Schmidt?

Did the whole crawl to find you.

I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm sober.

I'm wearing my strapless bra like a belt.

But I know what I want.

I want you.

I want you to be my boyfriend.

As much as a I want a commuter lane to Costa Mesa! (crowd whooping)

Vote Moscato!

(crowd cheering)

What?

They're kissing.

I thought maybe you were gonna say something like,

"No" or, like, "I miss him so much now."

Last call! (groans)

We got one more bar on the crawl!

We have to finish the smile!

You're never ever gonna make it.

And I'm never gonna ride a jet ski with Tom Colicchio on my back.

So, sometimes dreams just don't come true.

(shouting): I'm sorry about that guy Galecky not hugging you from behind in the water on a motorized thing... I'm sorry!

We will finish what we have started!

(cheering) Yay!

We will feast on the spoils of this night for a thousand moons!

In the name of love and booze!

(crawlers cheering)

Oh, no. My crush is back.

I hate myself.

(cell phone buzzes)

Oh, this person will not stop texting me.

Where is it? (phone continues buzzing)

Sorry.

Oh, it's an e-mail from Wellington Prep.

You do realize we were just about to have sex, right?

Say something to get back in the mood... say raccoon.

They're offering me the job of headmaster.

In England?

Raccoon?

So, you'd be the headmaster?

Headmaster.

Of Wellington?

Of Wellington.

(sighing): Headmaster.

Jess... look at me.

I'm not gonna take it.

Wellington's not even that great.

You have their current headmaster as your emergency contact.

Okay, it's heaven on Earth.

And I love it.

But I love you more.

Well, I love you, which is why I can't let you pass up this opportunity!

If we were ready to live in the same place, then we should be ready to live 5,000 miles apart.

Yeah, I suppose, but...

Well, I'll call you every night after work. It'll only be, like, midnight your time.

I could learn to stay up late. Maybe I should try cocaine!

Yeah! Or coffee!

That, too.

And I'll come and visit.

It's only, like, an 11-hour flight.

And then a four-hour drive to Wellington.

That's so long!

Which is great... 'cause I can catch up on podcasts.

We can do this!

We can do this long distance, right?

Right.

Nick (in distance): This is our revolution!

(crowd clamoring outside)

When I say bar, you say...

All: Crawl!

Bar!

Crawl!

Jess, are you guys coming or what?

Hi.

May!

May!

Hey.

You again.

Yeah.

Me again.

Look, um, I'm sorry about earlier.

I just, I-I really didn't plan on-on meeting somebody so great tonight, you know?

You messed everything up!

'Cause you're, like, awesome and that sucks because it's, like, that's not what I want. And you're pretty, which is a bummer.

'Cause it's, like, damn! She fine, but it's, like, at the same time, I'm, like, I don't need this in my life.

You wear a leather jacket...

I'm sorry. Are you... I'm just confused.

Are you trying to say something nice right now?

Yes. I am.

And I'm terrible at it.

Is there any way I could get, I ca... I, um...

I could get your number maybe?

(coughing)

Aw... (laughs)

A long number.

What the hell is this? Is this your e-mail address?

Write a good e-mail.

And I'll go out with you.

What...?

I'm talking full sentences.

I'm talking no typos.

No pictures. No pictures.

God, you are gonna make this really hard for me, huh?

Yes.

Aw...

You smell good.

Doug's Ale House!

The tip of the smile!

The crawl is complete! (crowd cheering)

Yeah!

Yes!

Yes! Get in!

(cheering, clamoring)

Hey!

Hey.

Everything okay? I'd spent a long time on the crawl, and now that it's over, it's just a natural sadness.

It's just gonna take a minute. Just go on in. It's fine.

What's the holdup? Nick's cracking a little bit.

Everybody, relax, okay?

It's just the crawl's over.

Kai is over.

I got nothing to do.

I just have nothing to do.

Come on.

Of course, you have so much to do.

Nick we're business partners, man.

We're teammates.

YOu're smart and talented guy.

And tonight we found out that you have a weird, _ charisma.

You should make more maps man. That's what you should do.

You're my idea-man.

Thank you guys.

Thank you for saying all this nice stuff.

I love you guys.

It's time to go inside. We got a crawl to finish.

Yeah. We got a crawl to finish.

Now out of my way, I'm getting another drink.

I can't let you in.

You're not wearing shoes.

Where are you shoes, Nick?

Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.

Everybody's waiting for you.

I can't go into the bar. I don't shoes on.

My map is just a deformed smile now. I didn't complete it.

Or is it?

A goatee face.

What bar is that?

What bar is that?

(chuckles)

I'm glad you asked.

Welcome to Winston's bar.

Hot stuff Aww Happy Valentine's day, everybody.

That's right.





You know how a computer is this big.

What if a computer was... this big?

The size of a man's hand.

And had a camera in it, and you can take self pictures, and it also had a phone.

So you can store the *

Kind of a good idea.

***

This makes me impatient.

And it makes me also so furious.

I need... 45 minutes away from you.

And then we can be best friends again.

Don't follow me out.

(grunts)

So, as you guys know, Schmidt and I are business partners.

We've been working on an idea we're very excited about.

We e-mailed our plans to a guy in China, and the prototype is here.

And... we've got a pitch meeting set up with Lori Greiner.

From QVC?

That the one.

That's right.

You know, Fawn and I were paired with her in a charity golf tournament.

You know, they laughed at me for playing the ladies' tees, but it paid off.

She's a shark.

Ha! A shark golfing.

(whoops) Now I'd buy that T-shirt.

Friends, imagine yourself in this scenario.

You're at the local gymnasia.

Oh...

You're<i> schvitzing</i> up a storm.

Suddenly, you get a text message.

There's an emergency wedding down at the town hall.

But what'll I wear? I mean, I'm sweating at the gym.

Huh, I don't know what's going on. I love this.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you...

Game time.

The Swuit!

The Swuit!

Ugh.

The Swuit. The Swuit.

It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.

Well?

This is it?

What do you guys think?

This looks like garbage. It looks like garbage.

I don't think it looks like... relax.

Nick, it looks like garb...

It's embarrassing. Put it away.

The bottoms aren't great, but the top...

Well, I like it.

I mean, I like you guys.

All right, I'm gonna go throw this out.

No, don't throw it away!

Why, you want to wear it?

(laughing): No.

No, no, no, no.

No.

(Coach and Jess laughing)

He said, "Do you want to wear it?"

Jess: No, I just...

I think... I was gonna put it in the Goodwill bin at school.

As lining for the bottom.

Get rid of it. It's a piece of crap.

We're-we're screwed.

Guys, you're starting a business.

There are gonna be some setbacks.

We don't have enough time, okay?

I'm running out of vacation days, and our pitch meeting with Lori is on Friday.

Friday?! (laughs)

You never told me Friday. He never told...

Guys...

I told you a hundred times it was on Friday.

That sounds like it could be right, yeah.

Could be Friday. Yeah.

Now we need another good idea in four days.

Ah, I can't work under pressure like this.

You know that I get nervous.

I am just a man. I am not a god.

Uh, I think we're all aware of that.

Why you talking like that?

Like what?

(imitating Schmidt): Well, we're all aware of that.

Guys, stop fighting!

You're upsetting Winston.

It's so early.

You made me swallow my night guard.

Oh, please, it's a paperclip with gum wrapped around it.

We're in a crunch.

Good morning!

Made you guys some brain food.

Nick: Ah, thank you.

I'm supposed to hang out with Kai later and do nothing. This'll help.

No time. The pitch is on Friday.

(groans) I'm gonna need one good idea every 20 seconds.

Ugh.

Oh, you're gonna time me now?

Yes.

It'll help you concentrate.

(retro-electronic music playing)

It's too beepy-boppy.

Well, it's brain music.

Go.

Look away.

(whispering): This is exciting.

I feel like I'm in the garage at Cupertino.

This sounds like the video in middle school that taught me about periods.

And time!

All right.

Let's see what you got.

"I am the Karduthian champion of... of dance."

"Beer bread."

Beard bread.

Bread that is in your beard.

That's an... that's an invention?

Or is that just something that happens to you?

You think Hewlett had to put up with this crap from Packard? Again.

Oh, now I'm Packard? Enough!

You can't come up with a good idea being all loosey-goosey.

Why don't you tell that to Howard Hughes, the inventor of the<i> Loose Goose?</i>

That was the<i> Spruce Goose,</i> and it didn't work!

It did work!

It flew for over a mile at an altitude of 72 feet!

How on Earth do you know that information and not know the name of it?

I don't want to stick my nose in someone else's rose, but what I'm hearing is two very passionate partners with two totally different approaches.

You h*t the nail right on the head!

That is a correct assessment of what is going on right now.

And thank you for breakfast!

I'm gonna shove this bacon right in my mouth and savor it for life.

That omelette was so delicious!

You know what, you guys are saying really nice things to me, but you're both shouting...

Such a delicious omelette!

The presentation's fantastic!

One of the most delicious things I've ever had.

You've outdone yourself.

Definitely appreciated!

Don't follow me.

Don't follow me!

All they care about is who's the boss.

Of course that's all they care about, Jess.

It's a guy thing. It's in our DNA.

Look, Nick's not gonna let Schmidt boss him around, and vice versa.

Don't get me started on the male power dynamic.

I will talk your ear off.

They're being such dudes right now.

It's, like, all about who's got the bigger you-know-what.

Oh, I do know what. (both laugh)

Yeah. Yeah.

What can we do to make them collaborate?

You can eliminate their you-know-whats. (chuckles)

That was a joke.

You want to hang out tonight and have ninja turtle sex?

What's ninja turtle sex?

Sex with backpacks on.

(laughs): Oh, sex with backpacks on!

Yes, I would love to, but I can't.

I got to do some work, or Schmidt will put me in the "Think Harder" box, which is basically just a refrigerator box that he hits with a baseball bat.

Gets me to think harder.

Talk later?

Yeah.

Great.

I really hope that you enjoyed your service today, and please come back...

Okay.

Thanks a lot, big spender.

You should probably show some clavicle.

No. I need bigger tips.

They're raising my college tuition, and if I don't come up with the money by Friday, I got to drop out.

So I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Wow, Cece, look.

I mean, we're your friends.

If you want, I can give you money.

Coach (mumbling): You can give her money.

I ain't giving her a damn thing...

I think what Coach is trying to say is that he will also give you money.

Look, that's very sweet, but the last thing I want is charity, okay?

And don't tell Jess, because she just goes nuts anytime she thinks I need money.

So I don't think I can afford to go home for my aunt's birthday.

You need money? I'm selling my hair!

Oh! Hi. Hello!

You're a handsome fella.

Can I interest you in a drink or...

Oh, you suck!

We got to do something.

Winston, for the first time in my life, I'm not 100% broke, and you want me to give my money away?

No, sir.

She said she didn't want charity.

I ain't giving it to her.

Oh, crap.

Am I stuck doing another thing with you again?

It's a classic Winston and Coach mess-around!

(both laugh)

All right. But don't say that.

What if I put your name first?

Let me hear it.

It's a classic Coach and Winston mess-around.

Regardless, I don't like it.

Oh, okay.

Hey, Schmidt.

So I noticed you're having trouble working with Nick.

Well, you know what, he's got a real head full of dog dirt.

Mm.

So I noticed you're having trouble working with Schmidt.

He's a bossy old tuna.

Well, we both know you are the boss.

Thank you.

But we both know he's not the boss.

Exactly.

Maybe you could back off a little, since Nick's been having, you know, man problems.

"Man problems"?

Man problems.

Huh.

Are we talking clog or leak?

He's got the wet Tuesdays?

You think it's 'cause of his tight denim pants?

Did the squirrels get to the tulip bulbs?

Mm-hmm.

And that's why you have to make him feel like he's the boss right now.

Yeah, of course. It's the least that I could do.

Well, I had no idea Schmidt had a cranky dank.

So, yeah, I'll let him be the boss.

(whispering): I'm amazing.

What?

I'm amazing.

What?

What? Huh?

What? Hmm?

Hmm, this is a bit of an unprecedented group, the three of us.

This isn't a social call, young lady.

Oh.

This is strictly business.

Here's the deal.

You need money for college.

No. No, okay?

I am not a charity case.

This isn't charity.

No. No, we've gone through this.

This is an investment.

Nick and Schmidt are looking for investors, so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing, too.

You're smart, you're driven.

We are confident in a very robust ROI.

ROI means "Return On Investment."

I know what it stands for.

I've been reading a lot of Schmidt's investment books in the toilet.

Life hack: the toilet paper makes for a very, very handy bookmark.

Life hack: read your phone on the toilet like everybody else.

Ooh.

The answer is gonna be no, all right?

Because when you borrow money from friends, things get weird...

N-N-No, do not mistake this for friendship, young lady, all right?

As far as I'm concerned, you're just a walking treasury bond.

Within three years of graduation, you will pay us back in full, plus ten percent of the principal.

I really don't want to do this. At all.

But...

There's always a "but," huh?

But I don't really have any other choice.

Yes!

You were right, man.

So I guess we're in business, boys.

Yes.

We wrote the check out to Cece.

We do not know your full name.

This is looking really good.

It's absolutely stunning.

This is... this is your vision from start to finish.

I might be the seed, but you're the farmer.

Hey, you two look like you're really getting along.

Yeah, well, you know what, who wouldn't get along with this brave, masculine, healthy cowboy?

What you got there?

It's a camera attachment.

That keeps the attention of your dog while you're taking its picture.

Oh.

Schmidt came up with a great title for it.

It's called "Perfect Pet Pic."

This is just a prototype that dumb-old me came up with.

If he put it together, it'd be a lot better, I promise you that.

Now, of course, could-could you just hold some pet food in your other hand? Sure.

But this is a lifestyle product.

That's actually really impressive.

I think Lori's gonna like that.

You know, I had a vision of what this product would look like.

And you carried it out and exceeded my expectations in a way that... I don't know.

It-it's touching.

Sometimes I feel like you're my arms.

I'm really proud of the way that you're handling this.

I'm proud of the way that you've handled this.

What have I handled?

Y-Your man problems.

No, honey, you're the one with the man problems.

I don't have the man problems. I'm being so nice to you because you're the one who has the man problems.

No, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only being nice to you 'cause you have man problems, and I feel sorry...

No, you have man problems and that's why I'm being nice to you right now.

Honey, honey, honey...

What man problems did you think I had?

Something hangy.

Hang...? You think I had something hanging off...

What'd you think I had?!

I don't want to get too graphic, but I... I was picturing something gooey.

Gooey's not the worst... I've had gooey.

Oh, good God, what?

Simply ignore it.

Who told you about my man problems?

Who told you about my man...?

Look, the only reason why I did this was to get you guys to stop arguing about who's the boss...

Don't you be sorry! Jess, you did nothing wrong!

You're nothing but an angel!

You tried to help us, which is a sweet move!

You tried to help a situation...

You're yelling nice things at me again! which was at a boiling point.

It's very confusing!

Nick: This is his fault!

He's been bossing me around for ten years!

If I hadn't been bossing you around, you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas and the ambition of a d*ad person.

I will never let you boss me around again.

Not even if the lives of 100,000 children depended on it.

Fine, if-if... I take that part back.

If a bunch of kids' lives depended on it, I'd let you boss me around.

You went way too far in that moment.

Fine, but you understand my point.

If there were five kids whose life depended on it, I wouldn...

Not even five kids.

Okay, I... No kids, I don't... Pretend I...

Just take the kids out.

I understand the point you're trying to make!

The company is d*ad! That's the point.

I'm going to that pitch meeting tomorrow with Lori Greiner without you.

You know why? Because a boss never breaks appointments.

You think I was born in the middle of the afternoon?

You're gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit?

Fine, go to that pitch together, and then me and you, we're done.

Fine, I'm done with you.

Don't speak to me until bedtime.

If you think we're gonna have a bedtime chat, you're out of your mind.

We'll lay in beds, and we'll just over the day together like we usually do and that's it!

No.

Fine, we'll do that for a little bit. That's it.

That's it.

Here, take it. I don't even need it anymore.

Bedtime chat's gonna be so short, you won't believe it.

Schmidt: Oh, I'll believe it.

You won't believe it.


Thought you might not show.

I drove you here, Nicholas.

Let's just get through this thing, and then we can be done with each other, okay?

Okay.

And, by the way, stay out of my way in there.

I'm about to blow the roof off of this thing with a little something I like to call the "Seven S's."

I bet you don't have any more than four.

Yeah? Watch me.

Go ahead.

Strategy, sizzle, Schmidt, sex...

Go on.

Stop interrupting me. I got... I got more.

Salesmanship.

Something.

Synergy.

Boom. Nailed it.

Damn it.

That's seven... How you like me now?

All right, that's really good, but it's not gonna matter,

'cause the only thing that matters is what I have.

A prototype.

So stay out of my way in there, and let me just show her the prototype, because that's all we need.

(chuckles)

We don't need a prototype.

Did you forget the prototype?

No.

Did you forget the prototype?

(laughs): No.

Did you forget the prototype?

Yeah.

Where'd you leave it, Nick?

I still believe in them though.

Part of me thinks that even though they're mad at each other, they'll get in there, and they'll figure it out.

I don't think that's the case.

Why are you being so negative?

'Cause they left their stupid thing.

What?!

Oh, crap.

♪ I'm delivering a prototype ♪

♪ And drinking a big coffee... ♪

(tires screech, horns honking)

Oh, crap.

Nick, what is the matter with you?

Well, I wouldn't have forgot it if you didn't bully me to get out of the house an hour early!

It was too fast! I needed time!

You lay on the ground...!

You guys ready?

Yeah.

Yes, of course.

Absolutely.

I'm talking about postwar.

That's after the w*r.

Prewar would be something different completely.

I was in London postwar, post-postwar, in '77, and, uh... I caught a few shows.

The flights were... Well, I think I spent two... maybe $250 to get to... (quietly): Guess who?

What are you doing here?

I'm just checking in on my investment.

Oh, my... Hey, check it out.

I'm a campus cutie.

No, you are not.

What are we learning?

Shh!

I am studying Postwar British Art History.

What?

Post Br-British who? What's that?

That's just a bunch of words that mean "Screw you, investors." What else you taking?

Intro to Afrikaans.

What else? Astronomy 101? (chuckles)

That's next semester.

Winston: Wow.

What you gonna do, Cece, join the South African space program and be the first woman to put a David Hockney painting on the moon?

Who is David Hockney?

Excuse me, can I help you?

No, no, we're okay, sorry.

Yes, can you please, um, tell my investment here We're okay, we're... that she can't make any money with art history.

That's not true.

Last year I made almost $22,000, and my life is very hard.

You see that? You should be studying to become a doctor.

They make good money, they get respect.

Paging Dr. Cece.

A doctor? We wouldn't see a penny for at least 12 years.

Here's what you should be focused on, okay?

Something with a low risk, high reward, and that thing...

Do not say hotel management.

Hotel management.

Oh, my gosh.

Look, man, it is a secure living and it's great way to meet people.

Do you mind... telling me where I might find more information on hotel management?

Uh, the dog, uh... the dog...

You put the food in the thing.

Uh, and then the dog sees it, and, uh, the food's dangle-dang... uh, it's dangling.

To, uh, do-do-do...

Dog...

Looks at dang-dang.

Tail wag-wag, uh, rev... dog wagging the ta...

Um, whatever dog's name is.

Dog's name is Claire.

Claire come in.

Who-who's Claire?

Shh.

Uh, Claire sees dog food.

Pic, Facebook, like, like, like...

Sizzle... Pet Pic... strategy, sex, something.

Strategy, sex, something.

S-Something.

Something.

This is the worst pitch I have ever seen.

(panting): Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.

Gentlemen, your prototype.

Wait, what are you wearing?

This? (chuckles)

This is the Swuit!

It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.

It was invented by Nick and Schmidt, and like them, it's the perfect combination.

That one over there, he's all creativity and ideas.

Thoughts and notions.

And this one's all data and numbers.

Six.

He can just keep going.

The Swuit goes from day to night and night to play.

Schmidt: Take my friend Nick here for example.

I mean, this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding.

I now pronounce me comfortable.

(chuckles)

Look, Lori, you get it.

Look, Lori, you get it.

Lori, you get it.

Do it together.

Both: No one doesn't love the Swuit.

Don't settle for substitutes.

Swettle for swub-si-swuits.

No?

I've got to stop drinking on the golf course.

To the Swuit!

All: The Swuit!

Hey, how'd it go?

She like the Perfect Pet Pic?

Even better.

She hated the Swuit.

Yeah, she's got a similar product on QVC called the Scruit.

It's a suit made of scrubs.

It was developed for prison weddings.

Yeah, paid us $10,000 to k*ll the Swuit.

Yeah!

Yeah!

So, Nick, are you finally free to do nothing?

Not so fast there, lady.

Uh, old Schmidty-bangs and I have to get working on our next idea.

That is, if you'll still have me, buddy.

Come on, man.

Of course I'll have you.

Look at me.

Look at me.

I was looking at you the whole time. Don't say anything.

When I say that, just let me say that and take a moment where you're like,

"Wow, he's about to say something."

You kept... you kept saying it as if I wasn't looking at you.

Nick: But what I'm clearly doing is saying, "Look at me."

And what you're supposed to do is be like, "Ah."

And then I'm gonna say something.

Ah.

Look at...

L-Let me say it first.

All right, guess what? (clicks tongue) Gone.

Now. We back?

Of course, man. (chuckling)

Come here.

Ah, come on.

Come on.

Come on, come here.

Come on.

Come here.

Come here.

Just meet in the middle.

Dynamic duo.

Dynamic duo.

Batman and Robin.

Yeah, I'm Batman.

I'm Batman, for sure.

Jess: You guys just made ten grand.

What are we doing drinking booze that you didn't buy?

Let's go.

Yeah!

Let's do it, all right!

Yeah!

Hey, can we talk for a minute?

Yeah, sure.

(groans)

Wow, that is some serious shade.

I guess we deserve that.

Yep.

Cece, look, I know I got carried away with the whole investing thing.

So...

I'm sorry.

Ooh, an Afrikaans dictionary.

Yeah, it was not easy to find.

Read the inside cover.

"Whatever drawings you talk about, always sh**t for the stars.

Winston and Coach."

It's very sweet, guys. Thank you.

That makes zero sense.

I know, it makes no sense.

All: Hey!

Huzzah!

Nick Miller, friend, businessman.

This one's for you.

("Taking Care of Business" begins)

What is she doing now?

I think she's making herself some tea.

Hey.

Hey.

What's up? Are you okay?

Kai broke up with me.

No.

I'm sorry, dude.

I'm sorry. What happened?

She said she wants to be with somebody who can just sit on the couch all day.

She said I'm too ambitious; she said I work too hard.

(stifled laughter)

Nah, it was the... It's not funny.

It's just that when you said that out loud, it made me laugh.

I'm really sorry about Kai.

She seemed like a great girl, but on the bright side, in all your years on this planet, has anyone ever dumped you for working too hard?

No. (chuckles)

No, it's mostly 'cause I'm either too poor or too sticky.

So this is a big day then.

For the first time in my life, I really want to do something with this, you know?

I really want to make this business work.

Schmidt, tomorrow, let's start bright and early, 7:00 a.m.

No, no, no, Nick, I want to do it your way.

Let's wake up at 12:00 noon.

Just said your way.

Hey, guys, how about 9:30?

Now that's a genius right there.

9:30, let's say 9:30.

Let's meet in the middle.

What's that book?

Oh, nothing, it's not even a...

General artifact.

They're giving out books at the bar now for kids.

What is it, seriously?

It's mine.

Winston and Coach gave it to me.

They're helping me with money for my tuition.

You need money?

No, it's gonna be fine. Jess...

Oh my God. I'm selling my car.

No Je... No, no. It's gonna be...

It's gonna be fine, OK?

***

(grunts)

Not a fan.

k*ll me... please.

The worst.

Now we taking care of business.

Taking care of business.

Taking care of business.

Taking care of business.

And working overtime. Work it out.

***

You're right, you're right. Calm down.





What in the hell is around your neck?

This? It's a crystal charm, man.

Yeah, the guys at work gave it to me.

Why?

Technically, it's "hazing," but, uh, I secretly love it.

That is the kind of crystal that should only rest between a set of old bosoms.

(yawps)

Did that sound just come from your body?

(yawps)

Hey!

Ha!

Whoa, how long you two been here?

When was the last time you asked me that?

Last Thursday.

So, at least Thursday.

What kind of lazy... (yawps) holes...

Don't you know what (yawps)-ing day it is?

For crying out l... (yawps)

Glen, you should see a doctor.

My name is Schmidt.

And I can't afford to miss work.

I'm sorry, Glen, but I'm with Kai on this one.

Thanks, Wilfred.

You ain't good with names.

Oh, honey, you're all turned around.

No, you are.

I think you are.

I think you are, I'm gonna get you...

(giggles) Stop.

I've done some research.

Oh, ooh, how about a head's up, man?

Have I seen those glasses before?

I feel like I want to remember them.

I got these in seventh grade, and I love them.

Stop asking questions.

All right, check it.

So nerd Coach went to the library, and some place that actually exists called the Hall of Documents.

The downtown branch?

Mm-hmm.

How's Kathleen's eye?

Oh, Kathleen's d*ad.

What?

Yeah.

So, check it out, guys, this is all research.

You two don't have to date in secret anymore at school.

Yeah, it's all here in the Lipinski v. Platte County Unified School District. 

Precedence for days!

Wow. Wow, you did this for us.

No.

I just want to pat it.

I just want to, like, frickin' pat it.

I want to nurse it.

Yeah, I want to provide it with milk.

Huh.

I used to be the hot teacher.

Now you know how I felt when you turned up.

A miserable path awaits you.

So you want us to come out, so that you can go back to hooking up with all the hot teachers?

Very much so.

But I'm thinking about you guys, too.

I mean, wouldn't it be better if you didn't have to hide your relationship?

Yeah, you know what?

I think we should do this.

I... we should do this, let's stop hiding.

Yeah.

But, Jess, will this make things tricky for your work and will it in turn make you distracted and preoccupied during our splishy-splashy?

Ugh.

No, no, of course not, I won't let it.

Then let's do this.

Yeah, let's.

Yes! We are coming out!

Cracking. I'm chuffed.

Dude, I do not get you.

I trust you, Miss Day.

Mostly because I do not want to read this.

That's great!

(laughs) Well, Yay!

I'm the easy one, dawg.

Seriously, it's the teachers you need to worry about.

Especially you.

You tend to care what people think about you.

(chuckles) That's like saying a penguin "tends" to be cute.

It's all it does, bro.

(chuckles)

So, good luck when the teachers present their field trip proposals.

If they catch a whiff of favoritism, they are going to tear you apart like... like a beautiful baguette, you know what I mean?

When you-you're having dinner, and you just suddenly say, "Hey, forget the bread Kn*fe.

Let's just rip into this with our bare hands."

Ah, I love that.

Hey, what'd they say? What do you got?

You can tell me, I can take it.

I-I don't know if I can take it if...

If you d*ed, I'd be lost.

J-Just tell me, I'll be there for you, I'm big and strong.

Is it cancer?

What's your problem?

Oh, Schmidty, you have cancer?

I can't watch you go through cancer, buddy, you're not strong enough.

What is wrong with you?!

Your friend keeps forgetting his ulcer medication.

Ulcer medication?

He's lying, please.

Take him home, make sure he does nothing all day.

Look, I'm not doing nothing all day.

Can't take days off wo...

My firm is wooing red potatoes, and I want that account.

Don't listen to that aggressive male nurse.

He's wearing the same shoes as an old Russian woman.

It's not an ulcer, he's ly... (yawps)

Yeah, that's your ulcer telling you to stop being a dick.

(groans)

Before we begin our presentations, in the spirit of full disclosure and transparency, I have something to tell you.

Mr. Geauxinue and I are dating.

No, n-n-n-no.

(laughs)

I just felt someone pass over my grave.

Right.

I don't see a ring.

This is a total joke.

Oh, you're joking.

There's none scenarios that this is possible.

Coach: Ladies, I know you're upset, but you know what I do when I'm upset?

I hook up with me.

But I want to assure you that this will not affect my judgment as vice principal.

Let's hear those field trip proposals!

Where are we gonna take those kids, guys?!

And you know what makes the water delicious?

Taking the poop out.

Hello, water treatment plant.

Okay, we're off to a rocky start.

They've got frickin' mini-golf.

They've got frickin' Skee-Ball.

They've got frickin' bumper boats.

They've got frickin' go-carts.

Is this you topless in the brochure?

It is, thank you.

Take a trip to historical Coach-town.

Lunch will be provided.

I don't eat yesterday's bread.

Yes, you do.

Is there a field trip in here somewhere?

I want to take the children on an interactive nature "experience."

Very hands on.

With, uh, "foll-ahge"...

"foil-iag-ee"...

Not bad, um, I'd be a lot more into it if you could pronounce foliage.

I messed it up!

Can't do anything!

So I've arranged for our students to speak to astronauts at the space station, uh, via Russian translator.

And, as an added surprise, actually get to operate the Mars rover.

You see, this is...

"Mission to Mars: Field Trip to Another World."

Jess: Okay, then.

(toy engine revs)

Well, you all had great presentations, but I'm sure no one can accuse me of favoritism when I choose Mr. G's proposal which was so, so, so clearly the best one.

(booing)

Ruth: What does space have?

You can't even walk on the ground.

You obviously picked it because he's your frickin' boyfriend.

Well...

Biology teacher: I see how it is.

My butt isn't cute enough... Should I call my ma and blame her for passing on her wide flat ass?

(imitates dialing phone)

Hello, Ma?

I'm not calling about that.

Just listen.

I said... just listen.

It's about my butt.

Should I continue?

I'm gonna say no.

You won't frickin' get away with this.

Eat glass and die, you tramp!

Mrs. Raws!

Uh, you're not going to work.

What are you talking...?

You're not going to work.

Yes, I'm going to work!

Sit down! Sit down!

Of course I'm going to work.

Gina needs me.

Besides, I like my stomach like I like my suits... no lining.

Here, take your bottoms off, put these sweatpants on.

You take your bottoms off, sir!

Why don't you take your slacks off, so I can put some sweatpants on? Now take your bottoms off.

I'm not gonna sit around here all day like an off-duty ice cream truck driver!

I confiscated three laptops, two tablets and an e-reader.

Oh, and this satellite phone with a condom taped to it.

My earthquake kit?

Hey, look... for starters, Schmidt, you're sitting up way too straight.

I feel like I'm sitting just fine.

Take a deep breath...

Inhale it all the way in...

Now...

(whispering): let it go.

(exhales)

Now let go.

(exhales)

Now let go...

I... I am letting go.

You're like a clenched fist, my man. Open up.

You're in a 1920s boxing stance.

This is a waste of time!

You're not going to work!

I have a hyperactive nephew!

We have to swaddle him!

Swaddle nothing! What?

What are you doing?!

Swaddle him! Get him!

Gotta get to work!

Shh.

Shh...

Shh... you relaxed?

Yeah.

Okay, ready?

You're gonna lay down.

All right, just for a minute.

♪ Good night, Schmidty. ♪

(sighs)

(whispering): Now do me.

Okay.

(whispering indistinctly)

Hey, what's up, girl?

Hey, uh... remember when we used to do it and it was dope?

Nah.

Nah? What you talk...?

You still like Ryan?

Well...

It's just the accent. That's the only thing that you...

You like the accent. I can do an accent.

(bad Cockney accent): Ah can do an accent.

You like when I do this accent, eh?

You like when I do the accent?

Not at all.

(bad accent): My dad makes cheese...

He just made me realize that I want guys who have, like, frickin' feelings and stuff.

Yeah, well...

But the boy looks like he was raised in a muffin.

Oh. Hey.

I've been holding office hours all year and this is the first time anyone's taken me up on it.

Ryan took you up on it, didn't he?

(teachers gasp, laugh)

This is gonna be fine and, um, I'm going to address all of your problems one by one.

It just ain't right.

Okay.

"Ain't... right."

Anything else?

It's not okay.

"Not... okay."

What else?

I'm not all right with it.

And when you lent me that sweater last week, was I supposed to, like...

Ruth!

It's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.

If you two are coming out, we are, too.

Meet my boyfriend.

So you like teachers?

I'd do whatever it takes to get my foliage trip off the ground.

And now I know how things work around here.

And you're not even my type, just so you know.

♪ Ba-da-da ♪

Don't do that.

I'd be way more into this if you had, like, a classic Latin build.

Okay, stop. Stop!

'Cause I'm a ginger?

Just get out.

(teachers murmuring)

Ms. Day!

(clamoring)

Okay!

I changed my mind.

We're gonna look at foliage.

Now, will that make you people go back to your jobs?

Yeah.

(murmuring agreement)

I won something.

I won something.


Hey.

What's going on?

Everybody was just so mad at me. I feel terrible. This is my fault.

Jess, maybe I should look for another job.

No! No! Absolutely not.

No, look, I have everything under control.

I am 100% confident that I'm making the right decision.

Winston: You got girl troubles, get a crystal.

Look, I'm telling you, Coach, women have been checking me out all day.

From the gentleman across the bar.

This is my favorite drink.

How did he...?

Something powerful told me it was.

Now, they gave me this crystal to help me on the streets, but I'm starting to think it's gonna help me in the sheets.

Winston, look at me. Mm-hmm.

And I have never been more serious about anything in my life.

Okay.

Stop rhyming.

All the timing?

I don't need a crystal, I just need to be more frickin' sensitive, so stop trying to give me your crystal!

Okay. I'm not supposed to be yelling.

That's what I'm...

I need to be working... I need to work on that.

I'm telling you, man, this crystal gives you the courage to do the one thing that you're scared of the most.

To me, it's country music line dancing.

Well, that is terrifying.

Don't do that.

You guys seen Schmidt?

What the hell?

My word processor?

You can't Kathy Bates me forever!

My work needs me. Gina needs me.

I'm sorry, but she's trying to k*ll you and I'm trying everything in my power to stop her.

No, you're trying to turn me into you.

Aren't you bored, Nick?

I've been doing nothing for exactly one day and I already feel pathetic.

The Nick that I met in college would not be happy living like this.

You've changed.

That's not true. I've always been lazy.

Physically, yes. But ment*lly, you used to be like a da Vinci in tie-dye.

♪ ♪

(clears throat)

Well, I'll be.

Think differently.

The beer teat!

Awesome, bro.

Ha!

Party!

Well, you changed, too.

You used to live by your own rules.

You were like a fat, Jewish Dennis Rodman.

But look at you now.

You're like the back of a horse in a two-person horse costume with Gina just farting in your face all day long.

That actually happened.

What?!

Schmidt, tell me, what do you get for all your hard work?

The sponge account.

Oh, great!

God willing, it'll get me red potatoes, too.

Sexiest starch since jasmine rice.

Great.

I hope your work keeps making you walk around with your guts in a rusty old wagon.

(computer begins playing '80s techno song)

Oh, hey, Nick. You're up early.

Before noon.

Oh, wait, is this Sleepwalk Nick?

Man, I love Sleepwalk Nick!

He always pays back the money that Awake Nick borrows from me.

Of course I'm up! I'm doinstuff.

I do stuff. I clean.

I'm cooking right now. I'm cooking breakfast.

Sun's up, Miller's up. People say that.

Huh. Oh, hey, Coach.

You're dressed like Ryan.

What?

(laughs)

No, you see, I-I... I've had these clothes for forever, I just don't wear them when you're around.

You are dressed like Ryan!

Are you around me all the time? No.

Dressing up like someone else isn't going to work.

Unlike this crystal...

Shut up.

And I am never taking this crystal off.

Well, I mean, except if I'm making a tomato sauce and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce.

Then I'll take it off, and that's just being practical.

I don't know too much about crystal care, but, oh, I intend to find out.

Jess: See?

I made the right decision.

Kids need to be in nature.

Emily Kopnik saw a butterfly and she said, "Oh, my God, country lice can fly."

Oh, cool.

Well, I'm sensitive and I care about things like that.

Do you like leaves, Eddie?

No.

Me, too, buddy. Me, too.

So rake 'em into a observational mound... or "a pile"... and then we transfer the piles into one of these special research bags which you kids can take home.

Hey.

What's happening here?

Here's another rake.

You're not just having the kids, uh, rake the leaves and put them in a bag, are you?

What now?

I mean, do, uh... what else do you have planned?

Oh, don't worry about it.

I'm a... biology professional.

So, how's that phantom ulcer treating you?

I sent you those Q4 reports...

Horrible burning!

Well, I'm glad you're back.

See? Look how glad I am.

Gina, let me run point on red potatoes.

I've got three pitches already ready to rock.

Here's a taste.

That's the first one.

That's the first pitch. "Here'a taste."

It's just a picture of a red potato, and the tagline is: "Here's a... here's a taste."

There's that New York sense of humor again, Schmidt.

Come on, Gina. Give me a sh*t at red potatoes.

No way, 'cause I need you.

You're the best sort of mid-level employee I've ever had.

You are the ass to my horse.

And I'm gonna keep you right here, right by my side, where I can find you.

Forever.

Forever?

Yeah, speaking of... Forever?

Yeah, speaking of... might need you to suit up for my son's birthday this Saturday, so...

What are these? Doesn't matter.

Keep your phone on, okay?

You know, sometimes I think about life, and it just makes me want to cry.

Respond to my sharing, please.

You're putting on a real creepy, m*rder vibe today.

Just FYI.

I'm not trying to do that. I was...

Just, like, going forward in your day, you should know that.

Just trying to be, like, feeling...

Hey, guys.

Hi.

What's going on?

Ruth: I think they might just be doing frickin' yard work.

Kids: ♪ I don't know ♪
♪ What I been told ♪
♪ I don't know what I been told ♪

Coach: Whoa.

♪ Foster's butt is mighty old ♪
♪ Foster's butt is mighty old ♪

Oh, we're violating every child labor law.

They're really good singers.

Keep up the rhythm. Mama won't be happy till you clear the back forty.

Biology teacher?

Is this your house?

Did you bring the kids here to work?

First of all, my name is Lorenzo.

Secondly, yes.

But you're the one who picked my trip, so it's your fault.

Boy: Can I have some water?

Okay, guys, stop working.

Don't listen to her. Keep working.

You don't have to work.

 I'm the vice principal.

Not technically at school, so keep working.

Stop working!

Keep working!

(buzzing)

(screams)

(all gasping)

Wasps! Everybody stay calm!

Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're getting in my eyes.

Aah! Damn you bees!

Ah! They got me!

Ah, screw it.

Here comes me.

I sting too, bees.

Bees don't bother me.

Seems like it was a great field trip.

So sorry I missed it.

I feel like a bunch of tiny people are holding tiny little lighters to my face.

(groans loudly)

Today was a complete and total disaster, from start to finish.

I've never failed so hard at my job ever in my life.

Everyone's so mad at me, but I was just trying to make them happy.

Jess, you can't make everyone happy.

Coach: You don't need them to like you.

You just need them to listen to you.

You're the boss.

Cece: Yeah.

I mean, if you were a man dating someone at work, do you think that you would be worried about what everyone else was thinking?

Coach: You'd be, like, in the conference room, like, "Meeting adjourned.

Except for you, Sheila."

But that's not me.

I care what people think. I always have.

Then your only option is to go in and be yourself.

Just got to own it.

I think I'm a little scared.

Well, that's very interesting. You see...

Have you been here this whole time?

The entire time.

That is why God... made crystals.

Why did he make that shirt?

Hey.

Hey, look, Nick, I got to talk to you.

I got to talk to you.

You go first.

You go first.

Okay, you know what? You were right, Nick.

I am a corporate monkey.

I don't want to be an old man looking back on a meager life of... selling red potatoes for the man.

I don't want to be a lazy bum my whole life.

I want to be the kind of bum that other bums look at and say, "What's that bum smiling about?"

I get that.

I just had an idea, Schmidt.

I just had an idea, too, but I feel like it's stupid.

I feel like mine's stupid. Let's do it.

I'm gonna... I'm just gonna...

I'm gonna go to the kitchen.

But I want to hear what you have to say.

It's important to me... 'Cause maybe it's the same thing, maybe it's different.

It might be the same thing, so maybe we should just say it.

You want to do the classic on 11?

Yeah, okay, great.

Both: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11...

Let's work together again!

Let's work together again!

Yes! I knew it! That was awesome!

That was it, man. That was it.

Back in business.

(laughing): Yeah!

Let's start jamming ideas.

Turkey.

Robot. Turkey robot. Just got it in one.

All right, let's draw up a...

I don't think we did.

Okay. Ready? Black.

Robot. Black robot.

Ooh, that's even better, son.

Boom.

Let's push for number two.

Let's... let's...

Exactly...

Black robot.

The blackest robot in town.

That robot's so black, it's the blackest.

I feel like marketing's gonna be a nightmare on that one.

Okay. I'm not good at marketing. I'm good at ideas.

Let's stay away from robots.

Okay.

Yeah? All right.

Okay.

Robot robot.

I said let's stay away from robots, though, and you just said ro...

Okay.

Black turkey!

Look, let's maybe pick it up later.

Computers for babies.

We are back!

Hair that looks like a helmet. Or vice versa... helmet that looks like a hair is actually pretty smart.

Oh, I'm really hot right now.

A water bottle with the top cut off.

Schmidt: That's a cup!

That is just a cup. Scratch it.

Ladies. (gasping)

Ooh... you got bee'd up, dude.

Yeah.

You look like a monster.

Yeah.

I'm not even joking.

You look so ugly right now.

So ugly.

Look, I'm not some little sensitive British guy, okay?

I am Coach.

But right now, I am in so much pain that I am losing my mind.

And I might never recover.

So say hello to the new me, who's basically a street lunatic with a face made of f*re!

They sting you in your pants?

Yeah, they... they stung my doodad.

I'm gonna get you some lotion.

Ow.

Both: Ooh!

Jess: Everyone, um, before we begin this meeting, I just want to say that... yes, Ryan is my boyfriend.

And yes, I let it affect my job because I care what you think of me, and I always have.

But here's what you should know: I love my job, and I love this man right here.

Wow.

I've been waiting for a moment to tell you that, and I guess... this is it.

This is perfect.

And, uh, just for the record, I love you, too.

This speech is wonderful, so please keep going.

Oh, yeah. Um, and you can come to me with any problems or anything you want to ask me, but I'm gonna make some decisions that you don't like, and you're just gonna have to deal with it.

So, uh, let's get back to work, okay?

So, is that the end of the meeting, then?

Yep. Uh... yeah, I got a little carried away with the moment there. (laughs)

Anyway...

Put it on.

Put the crystal on.

And... There we go.

Not gonna do anything.

(Shania Twain - Any Man Of Mine)





(chuckles)

How do I look? What do you guys think?

Not bad, Winston. I'll tell you what, man... you look like the funny guy from Police Academy who does the... the voices, and different sounds.

(Imitates radio beeping and siren wailing)

God, I wish marketers had a uniform.

(construction clatter begins in distance)

To Winston Bishop, owner of cats, taker of baths, graduate of the LAPD.

(workman shouts, clatter and banging continue)

We are so...

I'm so proud of you!

What?

I'm so proud of you.

You're proud of me?

Oh!

When is this night construction gonna stop?

I actually don't mind it.

Gets me ready for all the loud action on the job, you know what I mean?

Something has gotta change.

(electric engine whirring)

(whirring stops)

(whirring resumes)

Well, don't worry, 'cause I have called the city's automated help desk and I've also sent out an e-mail to information(a)losangeles.gov, so action has been taken.

Jess, don't you know how democracy works?

We need to get out there and grease palms, blackmail people.

We need to send them an envelope filled with fake blood and... and a note that says...

"I know."

What?

(Winston clears throat)

As if... as if... we know what's really going on.

Schmidt, you do realize you're saying this in front of a police officer.

I'm so sorry.

A little respect.

Can I try on your uniform?

No, this uniform is for official police business.

(whoops) Yeah.

Looking good, man.

Yeah.

We got a code Jewish, code Jewish.

You under "ch'arrest."

I can't believe Winston's gonna be a cop.

I mean, he's the gentlest person I know.

He once broke his arm wrapping presents.

Remember when he made this?

He's the sweetest guy in the world, man.

He's just so nice and... vulnerable.

Yeah.

Although...

Don't know what this is for.

Winston: Hey. What're you guys doing?

Uh, n... nothing, man.

Look, I'm a little worried about you, okay?

And so is Coach.

(Chuckles)

Kind of worried about you, man.

Guys, calm down. I understand, I get it, and I'm... and I'm flattered that you're concerned about me, but I signed up for this, remember?

Also, my training officer is gonna be with me the entire time.

He's got a partner.

I forgot about the partner.

That's huge.

We're silly. Yeah.

Yeah.

It's supposed to be a real bad-ass, too.

Was in a biker g*ng for three years, undercover.

Can't go back to Arizona no more.

Is that True Detective?

Apparently eats b*ll*ts as a party trick.

Great, that's really good.

That makes sense, what are you, uh...

Yeah, yeah, definitely.

What's that?

What the... ?

Winston: Uh...

Which... Oh, that?

It's a, uh... it's a project.

I've had a report of people acting lame back here.

Schmidt: Ow, Jess!

Also, I tazed Schmidt.

Winston: All right, seriously... no more playing with the uniform.

Officer Leslie Biggins.

Okay, Biggins, so Bishop's gonna be next, okay? Come on.

All right, here we go.

Officer Hank Bishop.

Eh... Oh, that one.

Officer Win...

... field Bishop.

Ooh.

Well that's gonna cause a lot of mix-ups over at the station.

Officer Winston Bishop.

All: Oh! (Whooping)

(cheering, whistling)

Winston...

All: Winston, Winston, All (chanting): Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston... !

Coach: Yes.

Winnie!

(Horn blares)

Aah!

Sorry.

Wow, a lot of city officials around here.

Maybe somebody can help us with our noise problem.

Okay, enough of this by-the-book nonsense.

It's time to play hardball.

Be a shark, Jess. Not a dolphin.

Right.

So I shouldn't be the smartest and friendliest creature in the ocean?

That makes sense, bro.

Sharks eat whatever they want. Dolphins... they jump through hoops, so, yeah, I think it does make sense.

No, it's awesome, bro.

Okay, stop mockingly saying "bro."

My uncle was arrested for having sex with a dolphin.

What?

What?

Carry on.

I'm having a lot of difficulty nailing you down, Ryan.

Oh, there's councilwoman Fawn Moscato.

She's from our district.

Yummo.

Where do I place my ballot?

She better get ready, 'cause she's about to have a very friendly conversation with a concerned citizen... bro.

Okay, Jess, it's not gonna do anything.

Won't make a difference.

Like what I did there with the ballot thing?

It was a good joke, right?

Didn't get the reaction I thought it was gonna get from you guys.

No, we got it.

We got it, bro.

Oh, I get it.

And you know what, I've seen the Bollywood movies, I've seen the UK Office.

Not a fan, not a fan.

Congratulations. These are from all of us, but I'm the one that got 'em for you.

Wow, they're big.

So, Winnie, where's your bad-ass training officer?

Oh, guys, I would like for you to meet the person who will be training me as I brave the mean streets of L.A.: Officer Aly Nelson.

She's so small.

What... say...

Excuse me?

You're so small, you're...

What is happening?

I think what he was trying to say was that, um...

Yeah? we were expecting someone who looks a little more like a cop in the traditional sense.

That's what I meant.

No, no, no...

Wow. No, no, no.

I'm not trying to offend you, we were just expecting, like, uh, either a really strong man or kind of like a guy with, like, a mustache.

Got it. And flowers are a... that's a normal thing to give to a grown man?

Or are they trees?

I can't tell, I'm so small.

Cool friends, Bishop.

No, wait, Officer Nelson, just...

Thank you. Thank you very much, you guys.

Oh, also, thank you for the flowers.

And just we're clear... the first thank you was sarcastic, because you embarrassed me, but the second thank you was sincere as hell, because these flowers are glorious.

You're welcome.

I'm sorry about the construction noise... it's an issue close to my heart... I do charity work with deaf children.

Of course, they would welcome the noise, because it would mean they could hear.

Let me let you in on a little secret.

Just go to the public works web site and download this form.

You're a dear, Fawn.

(Laughs)

I made a pun and I didn't know it.

You're too much.

Oh.

Hi.

Schmidt, this is Fawn Moscato.

She was just giving me a shortcut to file some complaints about the noise.

(whispers): Looks like someone brought a shark to the dolphin show.

(squeaks)

That's a dolphin noise.

Ah. Very good.

Councilwoman Moscato, excuse my trembling, but it's an honor.

Your head is enormous.

Why, thank you.

Jess: So you're taking her out to dinner? That's your plan?

I'm intoxicating a single, overworked public official with the pleasure of my company.

Which I will then parlay into getting her to fix our problem.

Are my sleeves even? This is ridiculous.

You know, my new tailor sews like an army medic.

I'm not being overdramatic when I say that I would rather sit naked on a hot grill than wear something off the rack.

Schmidt, just don't screw this up.

She's a decent woman.

Oh, excuse me, at some point in the evening, can you let me know that I have a call from Karl Lagerfeld?

Schmidt.

Bob, how are you?

Tony, love you in a chino.

Guillermo, f*re up that grill, Fawn's hungry.

Guillermo: Sí, señora. 

I'm Fawn Moscato.

And I approve this scotch.

Oh, goodness.

Okay, so I'm almost finished with form 7D42, but I'm not sure what to put down for landlord's birth city.

Hey. Ooh. What you doing, hot sh*t?

I was feeling saucy. I've had a glass of red wine.

Red wine makes you bonkers horny.

I'll make you a deal.

When I finish a form, you can take off an article of clothing, and that way, when I'm done, then we can just go nuts on each other.

Deal.

Hey, I'm not finished yet.

(sighs)

Oh!

This is America! Wear pants!

Jess: Red wine. Sorry!

Sorry. Sorry. Very sorry.

Sorry. Sorry. Geez. Yeah.

Coach: So, tomorrow's your first shift, huh?

You gonna play the name game, do something fun and safe like that?

(Phone chimes)

Dude, I'm gonna be in a patrol car the entire time.

(laughing)

I just got a text from my buddy Reynolds.

Working his first shift, he got s*ab in the leg by a little girl.

(laughs)

I love Reynolds, man. He makes me laugh.

That's funny...

You think that's funny?

To be s*ab by a little kid, yeah.

Coach: On the job.

Right. 'Cause you get paid.

That you're about to do.

Right, 'cause it's a child, and it's hilarious.

You don't like getting cut.

You're very physically sensitive.

I am. Paper cuts give me headaches.

I can't wait to meet him.

Yeah.

Maybe he'll s*ab me.

Guys, chill out, okay?

I told you, I got my partner to protect me, remember?

The little one?

The one would could take a nap in a match box?

Which reminds me... I'm gonna make her a sandwich tomorrow.

I might even throw in a crossword puzzle with Winston-related clues so she can get to know me better.

"Who likes cats?" Winston, across.

I don't like this.

Mm-mm.

His training officer can't protect him!

She's too tiny.

She looks like she won the silver medal in Athens for the balance beam.

Girl could drown in a raindrop.

I mean, that's girl's...

I mean, she...

I can't think of one 'cause I'm so worried about Winston!

I'm worried about him, too, but I can still think of 'em.

Uh, girl's so, uh... Ugh!

She looks like a Persian Webster.

Ah...

Girl's like a pepperoni.

Why are you here?

We brought you a gift.

Assorted candies. Please enjoy.

They are delicious.

Now, I'm sure you have friends and family of officers coming in here all the time to check on them.

No. No, this would be a first.

Really? This is the first?

What do you guys need?

Well, we are here because, uh, Winston is our best friend, as you know, and, um...

(clears throat) ... we're worried about him.

Yeah.

And I'm not saying that you're bad at your job as a training officer.

But I'm not saying you're good at your job.

And that's why we're here... to kind of see where you're at, to see if you're ready to protect our asset, our dear friend.

Let's... let's be diplomatic.

Did Bishop put you up to this? Does he have some sort of problem with me being his training officer?

Not at all. No.

Oh, he is going to pay for this. He is going to pay.

He shouldn't pay for this.

This has nothing to do with it.

This is about us.

Okay.

First of all, you shouldn't get mad at him. Get mad at us.

Get out!

It's good to see you.

Get out.

Okay.

Yo. Ry-guy. (Laughs)

I finished printing out the forms.

Let's get goofy.

Mm.

Come on!

Aah. Mm-mm.

You got a real Dudley Moore thing going on right now, and I like it.

(Groans)

Jessica Day, I think I'm in love.

Sorry. Did you just say you were in love?

That woman is a dynamo.

So let's talk about the whole construction noise thing.

Has anyone ever told you you look like a Jewish Kennedy?

I hope not, because that would be offensive.

(laughs)

What? I thought you were supposed to be some kind of big shark, and you were playing her.

About the noise.

Given the many considerations... traffic, budgets...

Okay, what is happening?

What are you doing with your thumb?

We feel it best to proceed with the given strategy.

She played you!

I know, and it was wildly arousing!

But let me tell you something, Jess.

She played you, too.

No, she didn't.

Mm-hmm.

No, she didn't. I filled out the form, I submitted it. Here's the confirmation, right here. "Thank you for your inquiry. We will respond in 360-500 days... !"

Isn't she great?

She can't just walk all over the people of the city like the Jolly Green Giant.

Jolly Green Giant...

He doesn't stomp on people. He encourages them to eat their vegetables.

You can't let her do this! We have to keep fighting!

She's taking me to a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a carniceria tomorrow.

You know, Jess, I really think that she may be grooming me to be her arm candy.

This could be a real Bill and Hillary situation.

You, sir, are no Bill Clinton.

I know. I'm Hillary.

Well, you're not Hillary, either!

I am, too, Hillary!

Hey, man, can you be the one to walk away?

'Cause I just, like... My little sleeping British bulldog here is gonna wake up, and he's gonna get scared if I'm not there.

Yeah, I got you.

Yeah.

Jess: A bunch of neighbors have joined the fight.

See, if you put out an honest message, you get good, honest people to help you.

Per municipal code 2B, construction is prohibited at night.

However, this project's been issued a waiver that we are trying to revoke.

Now, I'm going to mash a muffin into the phone.

You tell me if it makes its way through.

Jess: You're doing a great job, Dave.

It's important to keep it positive.

So, what happened to Schmidt?

I don't need him. I got this on lockdown.

Yes, it is banana-walnut.

Now I'm gonna tell you the story of how my daddy spawned with a pony and made the mud boy... that's me.

"Chapter One... Mama's House."

Make sure they're sharp.

It's political su1c1de to not cut the ribbon on the first try.

Of course. Look, if there's anyone who understand the importance of a sharp Kn*fe, it's a Jewish man.

Hey, listen, about the construction issue...

We've discussed that.

Look, changing that schedule's a logistical nightmare, not to mention the people it'll piss off.

The sewage lobby's involved in that project, and trust me, you don't want to cross them.

Did they sh**t poopy everywhere?

How old are you? No. No, they just...

They contribute money to my opponent.

Of course. No, I... I knew that.

They... Why would they sh**t poopy everywhere?

No.

Yeah. Got it. Hey, listen, I wanted to warn you.

My roommates have recruited a g*ng of derelicts to... to protest the council meeting.

If only there was someone who could oppose them.

Of course, I can't, because it's technically a citizens' forum.

Are you saying that I should?

I'm not saying anything.

Oh. Okay.

You're trying to manipulate me again.

You must think that I'm a real shmendrick.

Well, hello there.

When we're in public, Yeah. ... Let's just tone down the Jewish thing, okay?

Let's tone down the Jewish thing.

Yeah.

I can do that. 100%. Let's tone down the Jewish...

Hey, by the way, sir, thank you so much for keeping the councilwoman safe.

Man: Five stars for Arman!

He's an Uber driver.

I'm a councilwoman, not a senator.

Okay, I felt like that...

(gags, coughs)

(coughing)

First day on the job. Is this where you tell me to forget everything I learned in training?

N... no!

Remember everything.

Bishop, if you have a problem with me being your training officer, put down your ice cream cone, take your frickin' thumbs out of your mouth, and say it to my face!

What?! I don't have a problem with you.

Did you or did you not tell your roommates to come check up on me?

What?! They did that?

Yeah.

Oh, my goodness, I am so "furiated" right now.

I am very lucky to have you as my training officer.

My roommates don't speak for me.

I promise you will never have to see them again.

They're right there. They're literally right there.

Oh...

Oh, yeah, yeah, they see...

They got us. Yeah.

Hey!

Hey!

(sighs)

When you step to the badge, the badge step back.

Don't ever say that in my car again.

What the hell are you two doing here? And why are you talking to Aly behind my back?

She said that you guys gave her weird unwrapped candy and then you stole toilet paper from the station bathroom.

We need that toilet paper.

Because we're worried about you!

We're trying to protect you.

What?

She's so small, Winston.

You guys should have faith in me.

I got a badge, I got a diploma, and I got a special plastic thing that goes over my hat for when it rains.

(over radio): We got a 339 in progress at 62 Sage Brush.

That sounds dangerous. Stop him!

Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing?

We can't let you do this!

We're trying to protect you!

What the hell is your problem?

This is scary! We're not letting you go on the street!

This an obstruction of justice. Dude, that is an obstruction...

You won't die on my watch!

Hey! Hey, Nick. Nick.

Oh! I can't give you these 'cause I care about you.

Nick, give me the keys.

Don't give 'em back!

We love you, man! We love you!

Winston: Coach, you know I can't jump that high!

Don't test me.

Coach: We're protecting you.

Give me those damn keys right...

Ooh, no, no, no, no... !

That's what you get! (Chuckles)

Ow! Ow!

I can't go to jail.

I'm too sarcastic for the white gangs.

Yeah, man, I'll get passed around in there like a bong.

Shut up.

Ow!

You're not going to prison.

The dangers of noise pollution are real.

According to the World Wide Web, it can cause lack of concentration, nervousness, and misunderstandings.

(banging)

Sir!

Sir... clearly, manual labor has sculpted your body perfectly, but could you please be quiet?

(New York accent): Sorry, lady, I gotta work all night.

But, sir, people live and work here.

Babies sleep, dogs nap by the window.

Immigrants share noodles and dance to records, with abandon.

You're right! We should be looking out for each other.

You said it, handsome guy.

But you know who else should be looking out for us?

The city.

(cheering and applause)

Would you stop clapping? This is an abomination.

By the way, he... the only reason he got that role is because he's sleeping with her.

You want to get a cheeseburger sandwich?

My nights just freed up.

Of course.

That sounds great now that I can hear you.

Mm. Nothing.

What? What are you doing?

The cuffs on your jacket just look a little short.

What?

They just look a little short.

Why are you telling me this now? I got a new tailor.

I'm really insecure about it.

My God.

I'm Jessica Day.

Thank you for listening.

(cheering and applause)

Man: Tone it down! Stop the noise!

(clearing throat loudly)

Ah. N... noise.

N... noise.

Where would... where would we be without you?

I don't know.

A tree falls, a cabin is made, uh...

(Schmidt muttering)

It just... this doesn't... doesn't look right.

A woman screams, a b... a baby is b... a baby is born.

Maybe if the speaker would stop fiddling with his jacket...

I just... It...

It just doesn't feel like these are...

He's saying all the right things.

That son-of-a-bitch tailor ruined my jacket.

(sighs) That... that baby that screamed becomes a man and that... that was the story of Abra... Abraham Lincoln.

How dare you evoke Lincoln!

He was our quietest president!

I feel... I'm just so...

I'm so uncomfortable right now, because of my sleeves.

I feel like an idiot up here, in this jacket! Nobody's telling me my... my...

The tailoring is off! I'm going...

I'm seeing... I'm seeing a new tailor, everyone.

Sir... ?

My tailor's great.

I'll give you his number: Eight.

I look like a freaking matador in this thing!

Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

Sir, we've heard enough.

(Schmidt jabbering angrily)

Stand down! You look weak!

Considering the incoherent and, frankly, disturbing argument from the pro-noise lobby, I have no choice but to recommend a switch to the day schedule, effective immediately.

(cheering and applause)

New York!

What?

I'm Fawn Moscato, the people's warrior.

You're welcome, Los Angeles!

Tomorrow is a new America! Good night!

(cheering and applause)

Hello again.

I would like to once more revisit the bottomless clause of the public nudity ordinance.

Oh, my God, I almost hired that guy as a sub.

So, that was a huge failure. I feel like a Democrat.

Why'd you have to say that about my jacket?

All right. Okay, look, Jess told me to.

I mean, I thought your sleeves were fine. And by "fine,"

I mean I could not care less.

Oh, hello, shark.

I am woman, the smartest species of them all.

I didn't realize I'd finished that.

I've been waiting here a while.

You underhanded pig woman.

You know, there are certain things that you don't do, and exploiting a man's love of tailoring is one of them.

Which makes what you did all the more impressive.

Well, I felt dirty.

I felt like Evil Winston.

Remember when Winston was evil for that week?

I can't believe I blew it with Fawn.

You know, she said that we could have sex in the room where O.J. tried on the glove.

Schmidt, it doesn't matter what happened at the meeting.

She doesn't care about you. She's a power-hungry, self-obsessed woman who just wants a man to shut up and look pretty. That's not what you want, is it?

Please take me back.

Look, I was duped by a doe-eyed pixie and her Indian henchwoman. Forgive me.

It's fine. It actually worked out.

You were such a jackass up there that no one who supported the construction will be able to hold it against me.

Plus, I picked up a ton of votes.

Or as I like to call them... tiny orgasms.

So let me get this straight: You let me humiliate myself, in public, for your own political gain?

Hmm.

Yes.

You're the sexiest woman that I've ever met.

Ah...

Ms. Moscato, wherever you're going, take me with you.

Please... it's "Councilwoman."

And I'll call you when I need you.

That is gonna be... so frustrating.

But I love it.

Why are we in a church?

I once saw a priest drop his keys and bend over and pick it up, and it was just so human that it ruined religion for me.

It's a support group for families.

Pack it down. And you pack it down.

And now... weird friends.

... until one day, what happens?

And I know that his training officer is scary strong.

But, um, he's still my friend and the bad guys are still bad and I just wish I could put him in a giant envelope and just... just mail him away from all the bad guys... (crying)

There's no shame in this.

Do not judge this man.

We won't.

This is a support group.

I know what you're thinking: he looks like a little punk.

He looks like a little boy.

We... we try not to call names here.

Nick: Everybody look down. Don't look at him!

Good first day, Bishop.

Nick: You never look at a man when he cries.

Thanks.

Nick: Back me up, man.

You ever let your friends try on your uniform?

What? No.

Oh, yeah. Me either.

Don't do it. I'm serious.

Don't do that.

I won't. I won't.

Man: I'm telling you, you gotta keep clear!

What?

I'm... I'm not driving you to the ER this time!

It's your problem!

Get out of the way!

Don't look at me like that!

Man 2: All right, all right!

Morning, Jerry.

Hey, how are you doing?

How are you doing?

Eh. Different day, same bucket, right?

Is that today's Times?

Kristof's got a piece on net neutrality.

It's very complex, I don't know where I stand.

What kind of bagel do you want this morning?

Uh, poppy seed or sesame?

I'm going sesame today.

All right.

Get me a little schmear, would you?





Gingy, who did you harm?

Gingy, who ate your arm?

It was...

Santa!

No!

This is pretty dark.

We will rescue you, Gingy!

Wait till they get to the North Pole to avenge his death and take it way too far.

Santa's been a bad boy, and that's not right The white-bearded devil's gonna die tonight!

But I'm proud of that. They worked really hard on it.

Do you want to visit the prop closet?

Okay, just two more hours, and then it's ten days down a wine bottle.

Oh, my gosh.

All this sneaking around, I feel like gay guys in the '50s.

I can't believe you're going to London tonight.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

Come with me.

What?

Spend Christmas with my family in London.

That's, like, skipping seven relationship steps.

What do you mean?

Do you really want your whole family to meet the weird American girl that you're making out with in a prop closet who's also your boss?

Yeah. - Everything's been going really, really well.

What if I use the wrong fork?

You won't use the wrong fork, 'cause I'll make sure that you-you don't.

No, it'll be very casual.

And I don't care what they think, 'cause I like you, and I want to spend Christmas with you in London.

I've never been to Europe. I...

We'll stroll through Hyde Park, empty townhouses owned by Russian billionaires.

We're gonna go to Big Ben.

I'll take on-on the wheel, the Eye.

We'll eat cheese on the wheel and-and make out.

Uh, we're gonna ride black taxicabs even to places where we don't need to go and we're not invited.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Yes!

Okay, Alan.

You did your best.

Why did I agree to ride to the airport with everyone?

I'm an aspiring millionaire.

I should be taking a Town Car, not packed six-deep like a Hasidic family going to the bulk foods store.

Relax, Schmidt, we're all riding together so that we can hang out before we all go to our magical destinations.

Magical? I'm going back home to Long Island, the birthplace of the female crew cut.

Yeah, and I'm going all the way to New York because my mom wants to hand-deliver a Christmas card to Matt Lauer, but you, Jess, you're going...

To London!

'Ello, guvnor.

You got to stop it with that accent.

Fancy a tickle?

Borderline r*cist.

Check it out. I'm coming in hot with gifts for the family.

I'm ready for anything.

Is that a wallet necklace?

Yeah, so I don't get pickpocketed.

Smart. Keep that money away from them Gypsies.

Are you nervous about meeting his family?

No, no. Yes.

All right, here's the plan.

We're at O'Hare at 8:00, O'Leary's at 9:00, we're drunk by 6:00.

See what I did there? We're drinking on the plane.

Man, I love Christmas Eve Eve at O'Leary's.

I always get laid. See, here, I'm a six, sixish.

Uh, but I'm a Chicago ten.

Yeah. I'm a six, man? Maybe a little higher.

Seven.

But I'm... I'm a seven, thank you.

Plus Nick is dating Kai now, which means I'm getting the butt.

I'm getting all the butt.

I made you guys some snack bags.

Oh, thank you.

Oh.

You're like my mom, but in ways I can appreciate.

Hey, Coach, what's taking you so long?

There he is.

I know what you're all thinking.

You think I'm selfish for going on vacation instead of going to Detroit to see my family.

Not thinking that; very defensive.

I live with a million people. Four people.

There are going to be a million people at my mother's house.

I need some me time. And yes, I will be sad to miss my baby niece and all of her Christmas joy, but I've made a decision that I'm happy with, and it hasn't been giving me stomach pains.

You seem really great.

Yeah.

I feel good.

Can we please go?!

Yeah!

Let's go to the airport!

Christmas!

I'm getting in.

No, no, no, no.

Too late.

Okay.

Oh, yeah.

Loving the new Ford Fusion!

You don't stink at all, man.

Nice.

Are you wet?

Just my bottom.

Check out how roomy this is.

You could open a hat store in here.

Why would I do that?

That tree's cool.

What's it doing?

It coaches you to drive more efficiently.

Oh, look at that. Your name is Coach. That's fun.

I don't know why that's fun to me, but it is.

Pretty funny, I...

Hey, Outside Dave, will you take a holiday picture?

Well, I'd prefer to paint you, but it appears time is pressed against us.

All right.

Let me get a good filter.

Okay, now pretend you're really thirsty, but the only thing that can quench your thirst is the tears from a golden retriever. Go.

Oh, that's good.

Aaaaaand.... got it.

Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.

Excuse me, what's going on?

Midwest storm. Everything's delayed.

God have mercy on us all.

Ow! Ow!

Move, white bitch!

Ryan, hi.

My flight's delayed.

Please tell your parents this is not like me.

I am never late.

On time or naked is what I always say.

I've never said that.

I'll be fully clothed, but late.

I'll talk to you later.

Okay, I got this. Coach, your flight's okay.

Thanks, Jess. I'm going to go find a charging station so I can, uh, call my niece before Hawaii.

Everyone stop looking at me!

Cece and Schmidt, you're on the red-eye.

The red-eye? What do I look like, a 24-year-old who's too afraid to break up with his college girlfriend?

I mean, thank you for this.

Nick and Winston, I got you guys.

Next.

Hi. Hi.

First and foremost, I'd like to wish you a very merry Christmas.

Next.

Uh, right.

Um, my friends are trying to get on the Chicago flight.

Uh, Winston Bishop and Nick Miller.

Yeah, standby, tenth and 11th on the list.

I really appreciate that, but... is there any way you could get...

Nope. And now they're 12th and 13th.

I'm sorry. I was...

Don't apologize. 14, 15.

I didn't apologize.

16, 17.

Sir.

You seem like a reasonable person.

I'm not and you're at 18 and 19.

Okay... You know what?

You want mean, I'll give you mean.

I hope your mom falls down the stairs and she hurts parts of herself.

I hate my mom. Back to 16 and 17.

Thank you.

Don't thank me. 18, 19.

It's Christmas.

Oh, I didn't know that.

I thought they just did a black version of Annie for no reason.

20, 21.

You...

22, 23.

But...

24, 25.

Sir.

They're on the wing, dear.

Next?

No.

Next?

Stop pushing.

Flight 202 to Dallas - Fort Worth cancelled.

Hey, let's wait in the first-class lounge, like the other HBO GO subscribers.

You're a member?

Cece, I grew up on the mean streets of Long Island, just gazing up at the Manhattan city skyline, thinking, "You know what, one day, I'm gonna get there."

That first-class lounge is my Manhattan.

"Greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude."

Oprah Winfrey.

Sir, may I help you? Are you a member?

I just had an incredible layover.

Flew in from Istanbul. I just need to lay down for a while.

I'm a little...

Okay? Certainly. Uh, do you have a first-class ticket or a membership card?

Do I have a... a membership card?

Let me ask you something. I tend to, uh... tend to deal with, uh, Sarah Beth.

I'm not aware of a Sarah Beth, sir.

The last time I talked to her, she was suffering from the diabetes.

Is she still on the inhaler?

Uh...

Did she pass?

She passed, didn't she?

I'm afraid I...

I'm gonna need a minute.

I'm just gonna go inside, sit down, just kind of take...

Are you a member, sir?

Am I a mem...?

Can we just get two guest passes, please?

Of course.

Thank you.

That's a real thing... guest passes?

Yes, sir.

Okay. It's a debit card.

Is Ro-Ro done yet? Damn.

Okay, uh, have her call me, but m-my phone's about to d...

My ph... Hello?

Damn it.

Really? Phone and a laptop?

You're playing solitaire?

Is that a keyboard?

Dude, come on!

Why we should've taken trains.

The sky's too fickle.

It's the play place for butterflies.

"Can't wait to see you.

House at the end of the lane"?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

What?

This is where Ryan lives.

Whoa!

What?

It's a gorgeous mansion.

He said it was casual.

Does "casual" mean something very different in England?

Like... like "we own England"?

That's some McDuck money!

That's "do whatever I want" money.

Exactly. - You better learn how to ride a polo horse.

It's actually a polio horse.

Uh, originally they were bred as helper horses for people with polio, but I don't think anything of what I just said was correct, so...

What is...? Are you all right?

Hey. My flight's delayed.

Might not even meet his very rich family.

Anyway, you guys should go to your-your gate.

Get out of here, you Christmas... packages.

All right. Merry Christmas.

All right, let's... Yeah.

Okay. Yeah.

All of that good stuff.

See you later.

Safe travels.

Is that a falcon wearing a necklace?

Can I help you?

Sir...

I'd like the strongest drink you have, and also a wine spritzer on the side in case I don't like it.

Thank you.

Looks like somebody's not so merry.

Come on.

Are you...?

Okay, um... that's silly.

I really want this to be true.

What seems to be troubling you?

I just found out that my boyfriend is... is really rich, and there's no way his parents are gonna like me, and he's... Well, have you ever thought that the world is just full of sloths, and then one day, this beautiful lion walks in?

Actually, you've probably never thought that way, Santa.

Can I just go ahead and call you Santa?

Anyway, should I just bail on this trip?

Hmm, sounds complicated.

Yeah. Why don't you come with me to the family bathroom, sit on my lap, and I'll give you the sleigh ride you'll never forget?

What? Santa!

North Pole.

Player for life.

Get out of here!

Pervert Santa! No cookies for you here, you white-bearded freak!

Well, well, well.

If it isn't ol' Bangs LaRue.

Don't test me, sweetie. I'll put your head in a trash can.

Wow.

You and I are gonna drink.

Wow, this place is just so amazing.

You got to feel this pillow.

Look at this thing. This is the pillow that all the other pillows want to have sex with.

Nice. Look at that guy.

Bet he's the kind of guy who takes one bite of lobster and just throws the rest of it in the trash.

I'd love to do that... just once.

Stupid trash lobster.

He's coming over.

Hello, sir.

First time in the lounge?

Uh...

What's that, now?

Come on. Why would you say that?

Because of all the pillow squeezing.

I get it.

I get it. I was like you once.

Where are you from?

I'm from New York.

Uh, Manhattan, of course.

Mainly the money and museum district.

I can see the Central Park horses defecating from my window.

That's funny. So can I.

Robert Goodwin.

All right.

Schmidt.

Mind if I sit?

Please, go ahead.

Due to increased security, please have your picture ID ready.

All right, here's what we got to do.

We got to convince a bunch of people not to fly, and then we're at the top of the list.

It's foolproof... unless it doesn't work.

Then it didn't work, so I think we got a 50-50 chance to do it, so let's do it.

Wait.

Ah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, let's go.

Yeah.

What's up, boys?

Those are the guys I was just drinking with at the bar.

Are you sure you guys can fly a plane?

I'm sure it's not a big deal.

I bet the weed will offset the booze.

Ah, hey there, precious.

Yeah, you're quiet now, but when that air pressure hits you, you're gonna be screaming like a cat in the dishwasher.

And I won't stop you.

This could be it, so... if we all die on this plane, was it worth it?

I say yeah, let's get to Chicago.

Who cares? It's snowing there.

You gonna bite me?

When we get on the plane, I'm gonna bite you back.

Breast-feeding is a... very sensitive subject for me.

I can help who's next. Sir?

Uh, sir, he doesn't work here.

Oh, yes, I do.

Uh, no, you... - Oh, I'm sorry. Your flight's been canceled.

The flight has not been canceled.

Flight's been canceled.

Security!

Security! Please get this woman out of here!

Please get this man...

She's wearing a fake outfit.

You know what? I don't know...

Debbie, don't start with me. You're in a mood.

And then he sent me this text.

Oh, my God.

Where's Anna and Mr. Bates?

Do you watch Downton?

Yeah.

I know it's a soap opera, but I like it.

It's not even about the money.

That's big.

It's like every new piece of information I get about him just makes him more and more out of my league.

Mm.

He'll be nice about it, but the moment I get there, everybody will know I don't belong there.

Am I being dumb?

No.

Did I ever tell you about that time I met my ex-boyfriend's family over the holidays?

I've known you for 20 minutes.

Well, it was worse than the last season of Scrubs.

A teaching hospital? Come on!

People think Christmas is gonna be like Love Actually and "God Only Knows" is gonna play over their happy ending, but it won't.

Do what I do.

Hide out with a pizza and save the big issues for the New Year.

Oh, God.

Don't judge me for eating pizza!

No. My presents are gone.

What?

Santa stole my presents.

He was a Reverse Santa.

"Reverse Santa"?

What am I gonna do now?

You can't go now.

You're right.

I can't.

God, I'm drunk at work.

Sis?


Hello.

Hey. Let me talk to Ro-Ro.

Hmm-mm. I'm not trying to make you feel better about lying naked on the beach sipping some nonsense instead of seeing your family.

And are you using the cuteness of your daughter to blackmail me to come to Christmas?

Am I? Yeah, I am, actually.

Ro-Ro, it's your Uncle Ernie!

If you can hear me, get your mom's hair wet, then get on the phone while she's freaking out!

You want to speak to your niece, you know where she is.

Diversification.

That's what it's all about.

You know, I keep telling Nick that, but he won't listen to me.

Hey, man to man.

Anything. What?

I'd love to take a run at your girl.

Excuse me?

Now, don't tell me you're exclusive.

Successful men like us, we don't order just one item off the menu.

I'll tell you what.

You do this for me, and I'll do this for you.

Gold Select.

Gets you into any airport club in the world... minus New Zealand.

What's going on guys?

Closing some deals?

Well, actually...

No... we are not.

You know what they call you where I'm from?

A dirty old bitch.

Dirty old "biatch."

"Biatch," just in general.

'Cause I ain't from Manhattan, sir.

I'm from Long Island.

5-1-6, up in your lounge, sucka.

You better calm down, or you're gonna be kicked out of the...

Good, I don't want to be in this lounge, I don't want to be in any club that you're a part of.

Okay, am I missing something?

I don't want to be in any lounge or club that you're a part of, sir.

You dirty old bitch, for good measure.

'Cause I'm from Long Island, I'll take the railroad... LIRR.

You're embarrassing yourself.

New York, Long Island.

Billy Joel.

Cece, let's roll.

Okay.

Nassau County.

Billy Joel, one more time.

"Piano Man."

"Goodnight Saigon."

That's a sad one.

Cry about that, you dirty old bitch.

So they go to this bar in Chicago to get Winston laid...

And one of these guys is your ex?

Yeah, Nick.

Mm, the nicest thing I ever did for an ex is give him a ride to the airport.

And for me, that's just going to work, and I still barely did it.

Okay, please don't take this as a Christmas miracle.

But what can I do to help?

Do you want to fly first-class somewhere, like Pittsburgh?

And then tell everyone you're a Latin pop star?

I did that once, and it's kind of the perfect Christmas.

You can pass as Latin.

Actually, you know what I'd love?

Hope first class is okay.

And don't freak out, but I think Paul Dano's on your flight.

And don't thank me, thank her.

But thank me also, because I'm the one that did it.

Wow, this is really amazing.

Thank you, guys.

Don't thank us, go.

Call me if you want to hang out this week.

I was thinking about going to the mountains and crying at some point, but that's flexible.

All right, I got to bounce before these people I bumped come after me.

Don't worry, they deserve it.

I'm being bumped?

You're an idiot, I'm Gold Select.

Check it out.

Come on, just tell me what he said.

Without going into specifics, he disrespected something more important to me than any stupid lounge.

Daniel Craig's tailoring?

No.

Something priceless.

Hey.

What?

I stole you something.

Bam!

You sneaky Indian mouse.

I'm in my own lounge now.

Look, I know this is kind of dumb to say, but I really like being your friend.

My friend.

I like being your friend, too.

Yeah.

Merry Christmas, Schmidt.

Merry Christmas, Cecilia.

Is it crazy that I'm considering going to Detroit instead of Hawaii?

Yes.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I thought that.

Ooh, this is a fancy seat.

Reminds me of the seat my grandmother used to ride up and down the stairs in.

Hey, Jess.

Damn thing was comfortable.

Thank you, first class is amazing.

Smells like rich people.

I'm so glad.

These are nice.

Hey, where are you? Did you board?

Um, yeah, I'm on the plane, I'm sitting in my seat.

Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.

Wait, w... Jess, what was that?

Uh, they're telling me to turn off my phone.

Uh, we're taking off now.

Jess, hold on, hold on, hold on, J...

How do you change this...?

How do you change this thing?!

To the hits?

I don't know, like top 40?

Jess, what's going on?

I'm not going.

Are you kidding me?

You saw the house.

It's too much pressure.

Je...

And Santa stole my gifts.

Wait, Santa did what?

What if I do something wrong and... and I lose Ryan?

So, what are you gonna do?

You're gonna spend Christmas alone?

Sir? We're about to take off.

Yeah.

We need you to turn off your phone.

I understand.

I just need one minute.

It's gonna be fine, don't worry.

I mean, it's cra...

Sir?

Now, sir.

I'm trying to figure something out.

If she's not getting on a plane.

Hey, Nick!

This is first class!

Act like you've been somewhere before!

Merry Christmas, Nick.

Jess, hey!

Sir.

Jess.

You're not spending Christmas alone.

Oh, no.

You're going to England.

What are you guys doing?

Hey, you think you're gonna lose Ryan 'cause you're not good enough for his stupid family?

Has he ever had five people get off planes for him?

I-I hadn't gotten on mine, yet.

T-To be fair, we were in the food court, but it's beautiful, keep going, Nick.

Look, Jess, we're not getting on our flights unless you get on yours.

Airport chicken, that's right.

You want to take down everyone's Christmases?

Don't be that person.

You got to go to England, and you have to just try.

Go to England, Jess, it's worth it.

But my flight's boarding, and I don't have any gifts, and there's no way I'm gonna make it.

Oh, no, you are gonna make it, come on.

Yeah.

All right, let's go!

This doesn't seem great.

Okay, you know what, let's go, let's go.

Let's just, let's just run.

Come on, let's go.

Let's go.

So, I guess this is good-bye.

I don't care if there's no time.

I love you guys.

Ah, come on.

Get out of here!

Love doesn't matter!

Merry Christmas.

Bye.

Give me a little space.

Ugh!

Light a match.

Cece, watch.

Oh, my God.

Got him.

Hi, Ro-Ro.

Uncle Ernie!

Hey, I'm here. Are you here?

I'm here.

I got your text, and I came here to surprise you.

I'm outside your loft. Where are you?

Oh, no! No!

I'm in London.

Stay where you are, I'll be there in 17 hours.





Hey, hey, hey. Here, scoot down, scoot down.

Nick, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Sorry, just scoot down, I need to iron this shirt that I'm wearing for my date with Tran's granddaughter.

It's either this or the turtleneck my mother bought me in 2009.

They're my only clean shirts.

The short-sleeved turtleneck? Don't do that.

Okay, look, we need this whole table for Nadia's baby shower, all right? So, move along.

Nadia, isn't that the Russian chick who broke, uh, Schmidt's, uh...

Schmidt: Will to live?

After she broke my penis?

(chuckles)

Who saw her and thought, "That's the woman I want to be the mother of my children"?

She's not sure.

Yeah, she calls it her little "sex party miracle."

Do you have to iron here?

It's the only flat surface!

Besides Winston's desk... but he's using it to study for his police academy test, and he is "not to be disturbed."

♪ ♪

Not enough, not enough.

There's an ironing board in the bathroom.

I know, but I've been using that to wedge it between two urinals to keep Schmidt from peeking.

But fine, I'll use that!

Schmidt: Coach! Coach!

My Charlie Rose episodes, all 18 of them, are gone.

DVR is chockablock filled with American football matches, which, by the way, is a garbage... Oh!

We cool?

(Exhales)

Yeah, we cool.

Cool.

What the hell just happened?

Fight.

Yeah. Now it's over.

I barely even remember it.

I cannot believe you guys handle things that way.

I'm starting to think that neither one of you read the Madeleine Albright biography I gave you for Christmas.

(chuckles) I'm so glad we don't fight.

I know.

Coach: Oh, please. Women fight.

Well, we occasionally get into a little thing.

Yeah, I mean, like we just had that thing with the purse... but that was, like, barely even a thing.

Yeah, that was nothing... I mean, there's no point in even talking about it.

Oh.

(Gasps) Oh.

Oh. No, you should have that.

No, you should have it.

No, you take it.

No, you take it.

No, you take it.

I want you to take it.

No. Take it.

Look, I want you to have it

'cause it would look good on you.

- No, it's made for you. You...

No.

But then we both decided that it was better if neither one of us bought it.

Yep.

The neon yellow purse?

With the strap?

Yeah, I've seen that.

It's in your closet.

I wonder how many rubber duckies needed to die to make that thing.

Uh, Schmidt, you don't know what you're talking about.

I got to run.

Oh...

What?

Thank you so much for helping with the baby shower.

You know, you are just the best.

No, you're the best.

Whoa.

Did I tell you I love your top, by the way?

No. Oh, I just found this in the back of my closet.

What's... what's happening?

(whispers): You said too much.

So, I'll call you later?

Definitely.

Okay. Bye!

Bye!

(door closes)

Oh, my God!

What just happened?

That's a girl fight.

Schmidt, stay out of it, man.

Girl fights are dangerous, okay?

I grew up with three sisters, and I wore a cup until I was 14 years old.

What's wrong?

They planned to wear braids and bows and didn't tell me on purpose.

There. Now you match.

Well, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women. You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.

Schmidt...

Let us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.

I grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.

You can't buy that kind of access.

Schmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.

You don't want to get in the middle of that.

Coach...

Jess has the purse. I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.

Coach: No, no, no...

See?

Look... the purse.

In the immortal words of Tag Team, "Whoop. There it is."

Fine. I went back and I bought the purse, 'cause I love it.

(frustrated groan) I love purses.

And that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist, either.

I'm a damn feminist who loves purses.

Where else am I supposed to keep my feminist writings?

In a purse, that's where.

Lena Dunham.

I don't know. I...

Jess, it's a purse. Who cares? Just apologize.

Cece and I have been friends for 20 years.

Do you know why? Because we're passive-aggressive people.

We never confront anything.

That's the way it works with us. It always has.

Hi.

Hi.

And that was one of the worst fights we've ever had.

And if I bring up the purse, then everything else comes up with it.

Too many things have happened.

Women have amazing memories.

Because we used to be the gatherers, and so we had to remember where all the best berries were hidden.

And Cece and I, we've hidden berries all across the Great Plains.

Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska... need I say more?

Coach gets it.

See, Cece and I, we're gonna be fine, 'cause it's gonna play out the way it always does.

We're not gonna talk for three days, and then I'll surprise her with a latte. And then we'll act like nothing happened.

Three days without Cece?

Do I have to spend three days without Cece?

Yes. I don't trust you around her.

She makes you weak and penis-dumb.

Three days without Cece? Why don't you just replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic?

Stay out of it, man.

Stay the hell out of it, bro.

Here's a different take: Why don't I spend more time with her?

Stay out of it.

I'm confused.

Now, should I... are you asking me to spend more time with her or stay out of it?

Like, for real?

(groans)

I hate this. I hate first dates.

Me, too. I hate all...

I hate the second ones and the third ones and the fourth ones.

Me, too. Yeah. Yeah.

I hate dates.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

The first ones are the worst.

Yeah.

This is terrible.

They're terrible. They're awkward.

I feel like I'm being weird.

You're not being weird.

Yeah, I am.

I'm the weirdo.

I wanted to do this all night.

Oh.

That is so stupid. (Laughs)

I hated that I did it.

I feel like I'm being weird, too.

How?

I don't know how. Just...

Well, now you are.

These sweaters. I got sweater shoulder.

Now... when you do that, it's very weird.

But before, it wasn't.

Just don't do sweater shoulder.

Please don't tell Tran how bad this is going.

Oh, I will.

Don't. It'll be so embarrassing.

Yeah.

He's probably my best friend.

Really?

Yes.

You're not his best friend.

(laughing)

That's a terrible thing to say. (Laughing)

It's true.

This is going great.

Oh, God, I hate this.

I just want to sit around and do nothing, but that is not hot.

That's hot to me.

You add some sweatpants to that, and that is better than p*rn.

(chuckles) I love p*rn.

But I like to mute it and come up with my own voices, like, (deeply): "Hey, that's a very interesting mesh cat suit."

(high-pitched): "Thank you. It used to be my grandmother's."

(laughs) Something like that.

Cheers.

Yeah.

That was a weird cheers!

Can we go?!

(laughs): Yes. Let's get out of here. This sucks!

(chewing, speaking unintelligibly)

So cute.

Yeah, it's like they're made for each other.

They haven't moved in three days.

Very weird.

Alarming, even.

Wait, doesn't she work or... ?

Shouldn't you be studying?

Or live somewhere?

Shouldn't you be studying?

Or have worried loved ones?

Studying?

Coach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.

But I'm on to her.

I didn't know girls could be so slovenly.

I did. I have sisters.

Oh, my God, we know.

(grunts)

We cool?

We cool.

Oh. Just who I was looking for.

Hey.

How would you like a piping hot latte?

Thanks, Jess, but, you know, I, um...

I can buy my own.

What did you do?

Is this about the socks?

You weren't supposed to talk to Cece. What happened?

Well, I had to see her.

I can't go three days without seeing Cece.

(exhales) And it went just like you said it would.

I'm gonna go get the purse.

She played me like John Popper plays that little harmonica and fiddle thing.

Ugh. She's like a robot scientist.

And you're like a damn robot.

And usually it's cute, except when you're robbing me.

Jess, I'm sorry. So... what... what happens now?

You bring her another coffee and you guys make up?

I don't know what happens now.

We're in unchartered territory 'cause you got involved.

We're entering the abyss.

It's like the month I decided not to wear a bra. Those were dark times.

I had no support. Literally no support.

(Phone dings)

(scoffs) Cece just texted me a smiley face.

Is that bad?

No, she just texted me the world's first good smiley face.

I'm gonna text her... (chuckles) ... a yellow heart.

No, uh, yellow heart, whale, thumbs up.

(Whoosh)

Well, that seems nice.

(Whoosh)

(gasps)How dare she? Chinese man, ballerina, apartment building?

What does that mean?

Fine. Poop. Turban guy. Granny.

(whoosh, whoosh)

Don't text her poop.

(Gasps) expl*si*n, monkey-see? You want to play dirty? Fine.

Slice of cake. Turtle.

(Whoosh)

Don't sen... Oh.

(Whoosh) (gasps)

Double syringe?

Double syringe.

You're right, Schmidt.

Maybe it's time to dig up some berries.

The gatherers have become the hunters.

Be well.

Wh... where are you... where are going?

L... leave those berries be.

- Republican or Democrat?

West Wing.

What's your favorite thing about America?

- Kentucky women.

Favorite part of The Rock?

"Welcome to the Rock."

Gorilla or monkey?

Gorilla, hands down.

Miranda or Carrie?

Gorilla.

That's 100% perfect.

Unb... unbelievable.

Thank you.

The battery in the remote control is getting a little jumpy. I'm gonna go grab one out of the smoke detector.

That's exactly where I get them.

Isn't she perfect?

In a word: No.

Nick, you might want to sit down for this.

I'm already sitting.

Okay.

Well, look... I put together a profile.

Vague about where she lives.

Okay.

No mention of a job.

Always lets you pay.

Nick, my man, as unbelievable as this sounds... (chuckles) ... you're her sugar daddy.

What kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy?

Only one kind: a homeless woman.

Kai is not homeless.

Nick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?

She... she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.

She always dresses in layers, tons of layers.

She's not homeless. Her grandfather is Tran.

And where does he hang out?

A park bench.

I think you're having a nervous breakdown.

I really do.

You're nuts. You want to avoid studying so much that you're making up lies about my new lover friend.

Just leave us alone.

Maybe you should... maybe you should give her our can opener. Everybody gives bums cans, but they can't open them cans.

How are they gonna open the cans, Nick?

Hey...

What are you... (stammers)

Do you want a blanket?

I must have fallen asleep reading.

Nap with me.

Okay.

Come on.

(Short chuckle)

Just... gonna get some of these newspapers.

It's actually kind of nice.

See?


(indistinct conversations)

More pink lemonade?

I'm going to name baby...

Baby, because it's funny. (Giggles)

(soft chuckle)

Where is top of baby cage?

Double syringe?

Hey, you. How's pee-pee? (Giggles)

Oh, hello, Nadia.

Coach, I need you. Jess and Cece are in a thing, and it is terrifying.

I'm pretty busy, but, all right, hold on, let me put down the stuff I've been working on.

(softly grunting)

Coach, I am at the baby shower.

You're at the... what?

Are you dumb? You're dumb.

You're very dumb. Get out of there.

I panicked. I didn't know what else to do.

I thought I could fix this. I gave Cece the purse.

Obviously, it was a mistake.

Oh, God, look at them.

They're like silent, angry statues right now... it's terrifying and als...

Maybe a little erotic.

Okay, fine, it's very erotic.

You know what? Coach, I'm telling you...

I'm finding out that fear plays a big part in my sexuality.

Schmidt, what happens when two passive-aggressive people start confronting each other?

I don't know. What happens?

Anything!

Anything can happen. That's what I'm telling you.

Are you ready for anything to happen?

Obviously not. That's why I'm calling you.

Did you wash your hair? It looks really clean.

(all quietly gasp)

(Jess gasps)

I can help you end this.

Do you know why?

Do you know why? I'm waiting.

Oh, my God, is it because you have sisters?

It's because

I have sisters! And you know what that means?

And that you know more about women than me.

I know more about women than you.

And that I'm a little dum-dum.

And I'm a big smart-smart.

Yeah. Now, here's what you're gonna do.

Get big like a bear.

If that doesn't work, pee a circle around yourself and light it on f*re.

I peed before I came... I had a root beer with lunch.

I'm on my way. Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?

'Cause I don't want to be that guy.

You know, the guy that doesn't bring a gift?

Just get over here.

All right, I'm coming.

What? Coach.

Coach, I can't turn the pages.

How am I gonna study if I can't turn the pages?

Coach!

Hey.

(gagging)

Great catch.

Kai, I want to go to your place, okay?

Wherever it is.

So don't be afraid, because I'm not afraid.

I know I'm living this rock star life, but I'm still a man of the people.

But I'm so comfortable. You really want to go outside, get off this bed into the cold right now?

Look, I like you for you, and...

Well, hell, I just hope, deep down, you like me for me and not all the incredible stuff that I have.

Huh?

I mean, this room... half this stuff is mine.

I'm, like, I have enough pillowcases for all my pillows, plus an extra pillowcase that I don't even use.

Ticket stubs to all the Bears games I've ever been to, except for one.

The guitar pic from that guy who played with James Taylor that one night.

A Frisbee that I'm currently storing on my neighbor's roof.

You know, an autographed

Karate Kid II poster from Mr. Miyagi.

R.I.P.

Hmm.

But none of that matters.

I want to be with you wherever you live.

I mean, hell, I've been cooped up in this palace for long enough.

Wow. Well, if it's that important.

(grunts)

(laughs)

All right. Don't be nervous.

You know what? I'm gonna bring some extra blankets.

Okay.

Okay, just in case it's freezing, 'cause it's outs...

Okay.

Jess: And then, you told Mike Hannamin I was on my period!

He wanted to know why you were wearing sweatpants in the pool!

Okay, I was defending you!

I have arrived!

Ah, Mr. Stripper.

Okay, so what's next, Jess?

20 years of fights are happening right now.

They're getting into everything.

How I intentionally didn't put gas in your car on senior ditch day?

You did. You did.

I did not!

All right, ladies, stop it.

I gave you the money, and you spent it on condoms and taffy.

By the way, that sounds like a hell of a day.

Well, I wouldn't know. I was stranded on a beach being a virgin!

But that's not the only time I've been stranded, now, is it?

I'm talking about Paris.

Oh, this is about Paris!

I'm talking about Paris.

I knew it!

We had signed a lease. That's an agreement.

And then you decide to take a modeling job in Paris, so I had to move in with Spencer?

While you were being squired about the Louvre, I was having to pee on top of Spencer's pee to conserve water!

You know, it's called mud-sharking, by the way.

It's not my fault!

Stop it!

I'm bored.

Here's what you guys are gonna do.

You're gonna punch each other.

Now I'm not bored.

I'm not doing that.

What?

I'm not doing that.

Coach: Well, you got to do something.

Man up, punch each other and end this.

(sighs, sniffles)

Coach: You gotta have it out so you can get past this.

Now I'm bored again.

Punch each other!

Now I'm not bored.

Talk with your fist!

(sighs) I just want my...

(screaming, overlapping shouting and chatter)

Oh, no!

My goodness!

Back off!

(grunting)

La... ladies?

Oh!

Schmidt: It's spreading.

Stop it!

Russian baby shower.

(overlapping chatter, groaning)

(groaning, indistinct chatter)

Hey, hey, don't involve us, please.

Whoa. Hey, guys, no!

Break it up! Break it up!

(Grunting)

Baby shower! Baby shower, yeah! Baby shower!

Oh, stop it!

You stole my babysitter!

What are you doing?

I'm having a situation.

Oh, come on, dude.

Get off!

Fighting for no damn reason with me?!

Come on, just... lie down and take it like a woman!

This is for Mike Hannamin.

(Groans)

(laughing)

(screaming)

Baby kick. Baby like.

Yay!

Do I look pretty?

(both laughing)

Do you feel, like, really good right now?

Yes! I thought I was crazy.

No, you're not crazy.

I think I... I think I wanted to punch you for a really long time.

Felt that way. Like maybe ten or 15 years.

And it feels so good that right now we don't have to talk everything through.

Yeah. We can just punch it out.

Oh, my God, I have missed you.

(both laughing)

I can't believe I've known you 20 years.

And you're still my favorite person to talk to.

And you're my favorite person to talk to.

I hate not talking to you.

I feel like I've missed everything!

You did miss everything.

So, does Nick have a girlfriend?

Yes. So weird.

You okay?

Yes. So weird.

(Laughing)

So, is Nadia going to raise the baby in your apartment?

Yeah, we haven't really talked about that yet.

You should.

(laughing)

Craig Hodges.

Oh!

(Phone ringing)

Hello. Nick. Nick, are you okay?

Nick: Winston?

Listen, listen, listen, Nick.

Winston.

Tell me everything.

Winston, she's rich!

Yeah, she founded some company that sells fancy water bottles to rich people to pay for digging wells in Africa.

She sold the company, so now she works whenever she wants.

It's a scam called consulting.

You see, I knew it.

I knew there was something weird. I was right!

You were wrong about literally everything.

But I knew there was gonna be a twist, though.

Okay, do you realize how much time you've wasted, and you're not studying?

Sweet Baby LeBron James, I screwed up.

(groans)

Hey, I should probably get going.

I got to get to work.

Yeah, it's karaoke night, so I got to get there early enough to break the karaoke machine.

How much will you make tonight?

Ah, it depends how much I drink, but probably about 140 bucks.

What is this?

I raise you to $200.

Now you can stay.

Deal.

Oh. (Laughs)

I'm like a boy hooker.

(both laugh)

Thank you.

Are you crying?

Don't look at me.

I want to look pretty. You paid for it.

(both laugh)

Nadia is the one who broke my thing.

Wait, you were serious about that?

Yes. That was her. I'm telling you.

She's going to have to childproof the corners of her cha-cha before that baby comes out.

Oh, Cecilia.

Thank goodness. Look at you. You're still pretty.

And, Jess, you know, you... you look the same.

Coach: I'm sorry about making you guys punch each other.

Don't be sorry.

You're so right.

Mm.

We've wasted so much time being passive-aggressive.

We learned our lesson.

Yeah.

Well, we're very smart.

That means a lot. Thank you.

Seriously, if you guys fought like girls, you'd still be arguing over the fact

that you recorded football over your Charlie Rose episodes.

It's all good, man. Yeah, well, it's nothing.

Mm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt would be like, "Oh, does Coach just think I'm a pretentious poseur who just records things to look smart because deep down, I am just terrifyingly insecure about my intelligence?"

Jess: Yeah, and girl Coach would be, like, "Does Schmidt think that I'm an uncultured meathead who has to rewatch football because I'm afraid of showing anyone my softer side?"

(clears throat quietly)

(Cece and Jess laugh)

Hey, man.

Oh, hey, Coach.

Aw, hey, you.

That's nice.

Oh, this?

I... I don't know. Thanks, I guess.

I'm kind of whatever about it.

No.

What do you got there?

Oh, me? Uh, just some sneakers.

(laughs) I hope they're okay.

I don't have an eye for things like you.

Well, yeah, you do. Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.

Your eye is so good.

I'm sure they're great.

I...

Not that you could look bad in anything really.

(laughs)

(groans)

(groans) Son of a...

(groans) Thank you for that.

Yeah, thanks, man.

Anytime.

We cool?

Yeah, we cool.

(whistles)

Ooh, boy.

How many pages are in this thing?

Darius Miles. Oh!

That's in there?

Jordan!

Massaging is illegal?

What?

Gotta download a song.





Friends, ex-girlfriend, Winston, months ago I warned you that winter was coming.

And for the cold and wretched days ahead, I stressed our need to take lovers and take them quickly.

Jess: Your head is huge.

(chuckles) Your hat's the size of a garbage can.

Nick: You look great in that hat, man. What a hunk.

Jess: You look like Jewish Pharrell.

Th-Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Okay, now, winter is now here.

And I vow that we will not miss our final opportunity for sexual realization in 2014.

Did you steal my belt buckle, you Silly Billy?

Enough out of you, Winston!

Silly Billy? Dude.

If you unzipped your face and an old white woman popped out, I would not be shocked.

Really?

No.

I would.

I would be very surprised.

That is why this year we will not be celebrating Thanksgiving.

Instead, we will be celebrating...

Remember last Thanksgiving when I almost d*ed?

(others agreeing, chattering)

Bangsgiving! We'll be celebrating Bangsgiving!

Why can't you let me just have this, you guys? Please.

Okay. You've been talking about this for, like, a week, Schmidt.

We get it. Let's just pick names already. Jess, I can't believe that you are into Bangsgiving.

I just want to meet a guy so I can forget about Ryan.

Just date him, Jess.

'Cause I'm his boss, and it's against the rules for me to date him.

Just date him. It's a dumb rule.

It's against the rules.

Take the hat.

Oh.

Now, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.

And no date leaves until everyone is laid.

I just want to meet a nice fella.

Can I have permission to send them home without sex?

No, you do not.

I think everybody's date should be able to leave.

Nick: Yeah, your plan sounds a little kidnappy.

What's the rule on that, Winston?

Eh, gray area. We're good.

Winston is in. My man. And, okay, nobody say who you picked. It'll ruin the surprise.

Oh, crap. You picked me.

No! How'd you know?

And now you're gonna set me up with you, aren't you?

Cece, I-I know that this holiday is a bittersweet memory for your people, Wrong kind of Indian. but, please, do not take that out on me.

Okay, well, I picked you, too, so I want to re-pick.

No re-picking. And no more telling.

So, listen up, uh, for whoever picked me, I just want you to know that I have really gotten into feet lately, so do with that what you will.

No one do anything with that.

Can I just say no mustaches?

I'd like someone tall.

She's got to have an ass.

Can I just reiterate the whole feet thing?

I want to say who I picked so bad.

I'm looking for a fake redhead. With a medium-sized neck.

I just want to be slapped around.

So, Pearl, I told Winston that you work at my school.

And, um, Winston is about to become a cop, which you've probably already gathered from the fact that he pinned his badge to his sport coat.

What? (chuckles)

How did that get there?

Let me freshen your drink. (chuckles)

Excuse me a second.

(whispering): Hey, Coach. Coach.

Look at what Jess brought me.

Oh, Pearl? Yeah, she's great, man.

Hey, come here. You got something on your face.

Really? What is it?

It's, like, right...

What were you thinking, bringing me that girl from the police academy?

What's wrong with Pepper?

Allow me...

(chuckles) Arms!

She's jacked, dude. You should've warned me you were setting me up with one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

I'm sure she's not that bad.

Whoa.

Where was she when I was cracking walnuts for the stuffing?

Look, she's fantastic. She's beautiful.

You're gonna love her.

Now, if you jerks will excuse me, this Bishop's got to capture himself a queen.

She's doing push-ups.

For your lady.

Thank you. Thank you very much, Jess.

Pearl, she's... Yeah, she's great.

What grade does she teach?

Oh, she doesn't teach. She's the lunch lady.

You said the lunch lady?

Yeah.

So where exactly is this "date" of mine?

All right, I invited Lucy, like you asked.

Your date's name is Geoff and he will be here. By the way, he spells Geoff with a "G," so you know he comes from money.

Nick: Well, I think the real difference is crocodiles are man-eaters and alligators...

What in the bloody hell?

Uh, hey, Nick. What is Tran doing here?

Oh, well, I picked my own name.

So you said to bring somebody. So I thought it'd be weird if I didn't bring someone. So I just brought Tran.

You brought an old Asian man to my sex party so it wouldn't be weird?

Relax. He didn't come empty-handed.

He brought a game. It's like Thailand Monopoly.

Yeah, all the squares are jail except for one piece of property which we all have to fight each other for.

But don't get caught in the Red Light District.

This isn't a freaking game night, Nick.

Okay, chill out.

(knocking) You... You're making a mockery of this holiday and you know it.

I didn't mean to make fun of Thailand, if that's where you're from even.

Hey.

Lucy.

It's so good to see you.

How are you?

Oh, I'm great.

Lucy? Lucy's here with Schmidt?

Where's my set-up, already? I'm looking at the menu, and I see a lot of skirt but no steak.

I think that Coach picked you, so watch out.

'Cause I'm sure he's gonna bring one of his clients or weird, like, gym buddies.

(whispering): Ryan.

What?

Ryan. Ryan.

Ryan-Ryan?

He brought Ryan. Oh, God.

I don't think I can even look at him, like, without getting pregnant.

He just oozes sex.

Good holiday to you! I've come with biscuits!

(groaning)

Hey, hey, hey, Schmidt, Lucy?

I-I used to date Lucy.

Oh, I know, bro.

I met her that day you gave me the pass to your gym.

Hey, do you have any snacks?!

Yeah, you blew her off. I didn't think it would be a problem.

Oh, it's a problem. I'm telling you it's a problem.

And I forbid you from dating her, so... (whistles) cut it off.

Grounds?

The statute of limitation hasn't expired.

You dated her three years ago for, like, two and a half months.

The statute is very specific. 1,000 showers.

After that, no claim. And if you think I've showered 1,000 times in the past three years, then you're out of your mind.

Did you ever spend more than $65 on her, not including tip?

It's tough. There were a lot of coupons involved.

Did you ever watch her dog?

Trick question: she had fish and I k*lled them.

You ever get her a gift?

Every time we had sex.

(laughs) No claim.

(laughs) No claim?

Hi, Nick. It's been a long time.

Lucille. Great to see you.

Do you still like to eat, uh... popcorn?

I guess so.

Oh, you see that? I know her foods.

You must have spoiled her, huh?

You know, if you'll excuse us, I'm gonna give Lucy the tour.

Come on, Lucy.

I'm calling my penis "the tour."

My tour's more satisfying.

His is all about him. Mine's about you sometimes.

Hi.

Hi. Uh, thanks for inviting me tonight.

I-I didn't realize this was a singles party.

Oh. No. Uh, s-sorry.

Did Coach say that with a Sean Connery accent?

Did he say "shingles"? 'Cause he was...

He actually meant shingles. Like the... Like...

The... Everybody here is a roofer.

Look, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.

I know that. We both know that.

But this can't happen. Are we attracted to each other? Yes!

Do I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me? I do.

But my job is to enforce the rules.

And I love my job, and I worked hard to get it. So this cannot happen.

Is that why you locked me in your bedroom, and undone the top button of your dress?

I didn't undo the top...

Well, I did...

But that was an accident. That wasn't for you.

It was for me.

I just need to know that you will respect the rules and that this will go no further.

I'll do my best.

Looks like you missed a few.

What?

Okay, I summoned everyone to the roof because Bangsgiving is in peril.

All of you are focusing on things that have nothing to do with getting laid.

Let us please not repeat the mistakes that we made at my Eight Nights of Hump-akah party.

Now, what is the freakin' problem?

Coach did the opposite of what I asked.

Come on, Jess, you guys would be great together.

It's a dumb rule, all right? Dumb rule.

At least he turns you on. Pepper makes my ding-dong and my ping-pongs go into my body.

Can somebody help me with this keg?

Yeah, sure.

Pepper's got it.

(grunts)

What if she doesn't know her own strength down there, and she mushes it, or, Be a nightmare. like, rips it off and throws it across the room like a hot dog?

That's nothing. Jess brought me a hot lunch lady.

What am I supposed to do with that?

Do sex with the lunch lady.

Wait.

That's obvious. I have a real...

I know how it sounds. I know how it sounds, but she's a... like, a real lunch lady.

That's hot.

A woman that's willing, ready and able...

Nick: That's not an issue.

After she has sex with you, she can put food in your mouth.

That's not a problem at all. I do have a real problem.

Schmidt is trying to sleep with a woman I've already slept with.

Well, at least he has a date, because mine never showed up.

Geoff is coming! Apparently, a wild peacock got loose on the freeway, and is holding up traffic.

Now, you guys, we have guests downstairs.

And if we don't get back to them soon, they're gonna get spooked.

Um, so, have you always been from England?

I'm not going downstairs until Schmidt agrees to not sleep with Lucy.

Okay, yeah, sure. Never!

According to the statute, if you two can't agree, we take it to a vote.

The winner gets the girl, the loser gets five grilled cheese sandwiches.

Nick: I'll agree to that.

Let's do it.

All right, all those in favor of Schmidt not sleeping with Lucy, raise your hand now.

I don't care.

Couldn't care less.

Raise 'em up.

Put 'em up.

Huzzah! Warning: tonight things will get loud with Lucy.

But don't worry. I'll have her jam a sock in my mouth right before I see angels.

Okay, guys, what about me?

Get your own sock.

No. What am I gonna do about Ryan?

Just have sex with him.

Look, bang one out, get it out of your system.

I don't do that.

You should do that.

You should bang one out.

Yeah, makes the most sense.

What?!

Nothing else has worked, okay, and the best way to get over a crush is just to do something about it.

I don't know.

Plus, he's British, so you know the sex will be weirdly polite.

(with British accent): Do you mind if I finish now?

He doesn't sound like Oliver Twist.

(British accent): Do you like that? Is that good, eh?

All right. Here we go.

One... really? Two... what?

Do you mind if I do it like that?

Hey, you like it when I do it like that, eh?

That was spot-on.

All those in favor of Jess doing Ryan, raise your hand.

(talking quietly)

Oh, he's trying to mess with me?

Here I go.

Cecilia.

No, you cannot have my beer.

(laughs)

Nick: You think I'm going after the beer.

You okay?

Mm.

Okay, great.

(groans)

(talks quietly)


(phone buzzing)

(gasps)

Happy Bangsgiving.

(whispers): Close the door.

Oh, my God.

Is there nothing underneath that apron?

Just a little white meat looking for some gravy.

That probably wasn't very sexy. I shouldn't have said that!

No, it was very becoming.

I'm totally confused about these oven mitts.

How else am I supposed to take a hot dish out of the oven?

These mitts were a bad idea.

What, uh, got you in the-the, uh, holiday, uh, sp-spirit?

Well, I like you, you like me.

Why don't we just... bang one out of our system?

Bang one out of our system?

It sounds really bad. I get that.

And I hear it now, it sounds awful.

But we just bang one out of our system, and then, we can go back to our strictly professional relationship, and I can stop thinking about you all the time, which I do.

I didn't come here to bang one out.

Well, you know what I mean.

Look...

I care about you.

Well...

Jess, I'm crazy about you.

Ryan, look. Oh, God, it's so complicated.

Can I just put some pants on when we talk about this?

It is complicated.

This would have been worth it.

Oh, God. Ryan. Ryan!

Oh, God!

Nick: Oh! Yeah!

(hooting, whooping and overlapping chatter)

Oh, no!

Freaking Bangsgiving.

Schmidt: No, I actually put those in there myself.

I'll tell you, I wouldn't eat asparagus though.

It makes your pee smell.

(laughs) Mmm.

Hey, Cece, I got that $20 I owe you.

It's, uh... it's in my bedroom.

Okay.

Yeah, it's right this way.

You're really sexy for a Jew.

Not now, woman!

Wait. What?

Who needs men? You don't need a man.

You can lift your own furniture.

Hey, Pepper.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God, are you okay?

I am so sorry. You approached my blind spot.

Your money is in her somewhere. Let me just find it.

Great.

Oh!

What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself?

No, it's just not there. Let me... Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh, ohh, that feels so good!

When I'm looking for your money, it feels so good.

I love that!

(loudly) You nasty woman! (softly) Cause you are making me give the money to you.

Oh, Cece, you love this!

Getting your money.

What exactly are you doing right now?

Getting your money.

You are definitely not getting my money, in no world you have my money.

I was flirting with you to give Schmidt a taste of his own medicine, okay, and it's a huge mistake and insulting to everyone involved, and I'm sorry.

Yeah, and also he would never fall for that, at all, okay...

You are a d*ad man Miller!

Don't, don't.

I'll choke you to d*ad.

I'll choke you to...

Barely fighting. Schmidt, nothing was going on.

He was just trying to make you jealous.

Please, I know that!

He would never h*t on you.

You are on my Never List.

I know she...

Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?

You pissed me for bringing Lucy, and you bring Tran as a date?

Leave Tran out of this, he fought in Korea.

I don't know which side, but I know he is a w*r hero.

You couldn't find one of those drunk girls at the bar?

The ones with no family or friends. That's your sweet spot, man.

I know, I could have. I didn't want to.

Why not?

What kind of women have you been sleeping since you and Jess broke up?

Terrible ones.

And how does that make you feel?

Terrible.

Then reaaly good.

Expected, expected.

There you go.

And then immediately after terrible.

Just gonna put this out there, but I think you'd probably rather like to sleep with someone who doesn't make you feel terrible, but, you're just a little afraid of getting hurt again.

Nah, it didn't sound right.

You know, growing up we had this lunch lady named Miss Wheaton.

One day, I cut in line, so I can get actual tater tots.

And as punishment, she made me eat the entire tray.

In front of her.

While she's stared at me, for a long period of time.

And I'm not sure if you know how hard that is for a growing boy.

How old were you?

I was 18.

(chuckles)

If it helps, we're called lunch monitor now.

No one says lunch lady anymore.

(chuckles) Kind of like how you can't call little people "shrinkies".

Oh, lunch monitor Pearl, I like you.

Excellent form.

You don't have a hard job.

So, I saw your butt earlier. It's been holding up nicely.

It does the trick.

And I noticed, uh, Ryan left.

Yeah. Ugh! It's so embarrassing.

I kind of came onto him, and he told me he wanted more than just sex.

He wanted more than sex and that's a bad thing? How?

Well, look, I'm his boss.

We could get sued, and I could get fired.

There's a reason it's against the rules.

You gotta br... okay.

Remember when we tried to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

Okay, I stick by that... that kid is not a hero.

All he does is break rules. What's so great about that?

You're taking Rooney's side. No one takes Rooney's side.

I'm a vice principal... Rooney is my people.

Ferris hijacks a parade.

That is an act of terror.

You want to know what I think, 'cause you're not going to like it.

What?

I don't think this is about breaking rules.

I think Ryan scares you.

You like him, and you're going to have to put yourself out there again, and that scares you.

But look, life moves really fast.

And if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you just might miss it.

Is that from Ferris Bueller?

Yes, it is.

Okay.

It's a terrific movie.

All right.

And I delivered it perfectly.

It was pretty good.

What are you doing here?

You're fired.

(laughs) Just kidding.

Oh, God.

You left without eating so I thought, um...

I'd bring you a pie. Well, most of a pie.

The guys ate some of it. That's a lie.

I ate-I ate-I ate a piece on the way over.

I-I ate two pieces.

Three pieces.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Would you like to come inside?

No, um, I came here to say something and that this...

I want more, too.

This dish is empty.

Okay. I ate the whole pie.

Look, I don't know what I'm doing or where this is going (sighs) and I'm scared, but... it's worth it 'cause it feels big.

And that's why I'm going to leave right now, and we're going to take it slow.

Wow.

Well, tonight is Bangsgiving, and I have to honor my American traditions.

It's my duty as an American...

I think I'm going to stop being afraid and start dating.

You probably knew all along, didn't you?

If only I could meet a girl like you, Tran.

Your face, your brain... throw it in a dress.

Oh, daddy, I'd be with her forever.

I'm getting off topic.

Thanks for the talk. I feel a lot better.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Tran, are these all yours?

Come on, man.

I thought you were switching to white wine.

How do you think you're going to get home now?

You're not driving, so how are you going to get home?

(knocking)

Hey.

Are you Nick?

You the guy who's obsessed with my grandfather?

Grandpaps, you ready to go?

Hey.

(screams)

Ah, ah, ha... hey.

I'm taking off. Um... sorry I body-slammed you but this doesn't feel like it's working out so I don't really want to waste our time.

Look, Pepper, um...

I think you're beautiful, and very nice.

I just, uh...

You know, I'm not used to... dating women that are stronger than me.

How do you know that I'm stronger than you?

Do you want to arm wrestle?

Yeah, like I'm that insecure that I have to prove my masculinity by arm wrestling a girl.

(yells) Come on.

Ready?

Yeah.

One, two, three.

(grunting)

(yells)

Yes! That's how you do it!

That's how it's uh-uh-uh done!

(moaning)

(giggling)

Thank you for letting me win.

Sure. Anytime.

Well, Lucy left.

Turns out she's a bit of an anti-Semite.

Hmm.

Yeah, looks like we both struck out.

Okay, Schmidt, there is no Geoff.

Come on. But to honest, I'm kind of glad there isn't.

You know, Thanksgiving should be spent with the people that you care about.

Let me get you a beer.

By the way... you're on my Never List, too.

Hi.

Are you Cece?

I'm Geoff.

Um, I'm Schmidt's friend.

I'm sorry I'm late.

I h*t a peacock on my way here and then I held it in my arms until it d*ed.

It was horrible, but also kind of uplifting.

Um, anyway, I brought creamed spinach.

Ed Rooney.

Ed. This is George Peterson.

How are you today, sir?

It's not him Rooney.

This movie should be called "The Day Rooney Trying To Do His Job".





Oh, the female reproductive system.

Kind of looks like the Chicago Bulls symbol.

It does.

Now, this is the only part that matters.

The money train. Sure.

Hey, I call it my nine-to-five.

'Cause it's my job to work it. You know what I'm saying?

(laughter)

The large intestine, you degenerates.

What?

Let me see that.

I told Jess that I don't want to teach health.

I'm not good at it. Such a hassle.

Studying, planning, giving weak kids good grades. No.

I heard that. There are good things, too. Like you get to come with me to a dope two-day teaching conference in Palmdale.

I want to stay and hang out with the guys at Guys' Night. - What's Guys' Night?

Oh, yeah, we're celebrating you being gone. No offense.

Guys' Night!

Guys' Night!

Guys' Night!

The conference is gonna be really fun. We just have to work from, like, 9:00 to 7:00.

And then after that it's a par-tay.

Until 10:00, when quiet hours are strictly enforced.

But before then we rage. For three hours.

Actually, two because there's the half an hour of setup time and the half an hour of cleanup time because we have to actually be in bed at 10:00.

Cece: Ooh!

Are you kidding me?

Ryan is going?

Ryan-Ryan? The guy you have a crazy crush on?

I had a crush on him. Principal Foster says that administrators can't date teachers. It's forbidden.

That makes it so much hotter.

It makes it crazy hotter. But, look, it's not just about Principal Foster.

This is about how I worked really hard to get to Vice Principal, and I'm not gonna let some British guy get in my way.

Some redcoat bastard.

That's why I keep all of our interactions strictly professional.

Hey. How was your weekend?

That's personal.

I can't risk learning any personal details about him.

What if he taught his dyslexic sister how to read?

I can't know that. I'll go crazy with lust.

My pants will turn to ash.

And so exactly how do you plan to avoid this man that you are trapped in the same hotel with?

There are, like, a thousand p*rn that start that way.

Yeah, but no p*rn have teachers.

Every p*rn has a teacher.

Well, I'm not worried, okay?

'Cause I'll probably never even see him.

Jess?

Can you believe we're right next to each other?

Hey, you guys want sangria?

It's Guys' Night!

Only beer!

Yeah, what is this, Spain?

Great sangria burn, man.

Really?

Never let your guard down!

Aah!

Oh, takedown!

Never let your guard down.

Well played.

All right, first up, we eat meat.

How much meat?!

Then we take a fart nap.

Not for me. Pass.

All right, guys, it's Guys' Night. Let's think.

Okay.

Anything else we can't do when Jess is here.

Wow.

Look at that stretching.

I don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.

I wouldn't touch them. They'd want for nothing. But I would know they were there.

Stretching. For me.

I want to French braid that girl hair.

I want to French braid that hair so good.

The third hottest one just waved at me. Hello!

Ah!

Ooh!

Oh, no.

Oh!

No!

No, no, no!

Oh...

-Jess is gonna k*ll you.

sh**t! She's not gonna k*ll me.

I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have it cleaned, I'll have it cleaned.

Schmidt, red wine sets.

Shut up, Winston! It sets.

Why don't you just wash it?

Why don't I just what?

Wash it.

Just wash the blanket.

Unless you can't.

Come on, man. Get out of here.

I've known you for a lot of years and I've never seen you do laundry.

Never seen me do laundry... Get out of town.

Wait, wait. Is that true?

Come on, you guys, this is so...

Really, this is silly.

Then do it.

Right now.

We'll watch.

Doing the laundry...

It's no problemo.

Little bit of this.

What in the world...?

Straining the soap.

Get that in there.

Back in there.

Um, okay.

And...

That's it. Laundry.

Can't... Oh, so silly.

Forgot to put the quarters in.

That's right, the quarters.

Schmidt...

All right! I don't know how to do laundry!

I knew it!

Forget it.

Finally!

That is insane!

Hope you're happy.

Nerd. Nerd.

Dud.

Lady nerd. Goofus.

Virgin...

Hey, Coach, I need you to be my buffer!

Okay, but Nick can never find out about this.

Wait, what? Hmm?

What?

What are you talking about?

What are you talking about?

I need you to be my buffer between Ryan and me.

He's so sexy.

Really?

Yeah.

That guy?

Beautiful. Did you make that?

Looks like a Boys Department mannequin.

Yeah.

Hey, Jess, can I, um...

Nope.

No time for chatting.

We have to sit down.

You can't sit there.

Coach likes to sit in the middle.

Mm-hmm.

I sit bitch or I don't sit at all.

(whispering): You're weird. (whispering): You're weird.

You're a weirdo.

You're weird.

You're weird.

You're weird.

Shh.

I am education guru Brenda Brown.

Coach: Oh, no. Who is this? She looks like one of those ladies who talks you into having a baby in a tub.

You. the talker.

Mmm...

Stand up.

Talk to us.

There were other people talking, I just want to let you know that.

Why are you a teacher?

Uh, 'cause my... my roommate made me.

Hmm.

What?

I'm worried about you.

You're a worry.

Wor... why, why are you worried about me?

Teaching is an awesome responsibility.

You are not prepared for it. Sit down.

Okay.

Today, we will learn about our fellow educators, their hopes, their dreams, their bitter regrets.

The things they wish they'd said to their birth mother...

So, partner up.

Will you be my partner?

Mmm, sorry, I'm with Coach.

No, I can't do it.

I'm going to the bar. What?

Buffer out. Buffer out.

No, buffer in.

Buffer in. Buffer in. Buffer out.

Everything okay here?

Yeah, sorry.

My, um... my partner just left.

Or... did your partner just arrive?

Oh. Um... No...

Wicked.

Everyone!

Look at your partner, really look.

Take his or her hand and say, "I'm excited!"

I'm excited.

Oh, crap.

(knocking at door)

We just came to say we're sorry.

Guess you think I'm pretty dim, huh?

A man who can't do laundry.

You weren't born this way, were you?

Born not knowing how to do laundry?

Like everyone else?

Yes, Winston, I was. It wasn't till after birth that the trouble really began.

Here we go.

Schmidt: Nana wouldn't let me in the laundry room.

I think it's because my hands were always covered in butter.

And so I went to college unable to do laundry.

I'm making jean shorts!

I'm doing laundry!

Big day for both of us!

Yeah, it is.

As I pulled out my maternity corduroys, I spied a six-pack of Pi-Phis.

I need... um...

I need them loose to keep... to keep my sperm count up.

You know how it is!

Eventually, the window of time when it was acceptable to learn something so basic had closed.

I was an adult.

It was too late.

Well, I understand.

You know, I've never told anyone this, but, um...

I don't know how to read a ruler.

I don't, I mean, how do you start?

At the edge or the first tick?

It's confusing to me.

Are you serious?

Do you know how to count?

It always gets on top of me, and 'Cause then you should know how to use a ruler, you idiot!

I'm an idiot? You can't even wash your own underwear, you dumbass.

Hey! They're both super easy!

We're talking about laundry and a ruler!

I'm gonna teach you guys right now!

Let's go.

Each of you holds a stack of cards with questions for your partners.

You must uncover the answers. Begin.

What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Let me guess.

Your mother, who you live with, says, "Ryan, your crumpets are getting cold."

The thought that any ordinary day could be the day I look back on when I'm much older as being the best day of my life.

You?

Same.

Don't look away.

Embrace the intimacy...

I'm good.

Embrace the intimacy.

Okay.

You know, I think there's an art to a picnic basket.

Apricot jam would never go with a sesame cr*cker.

Of course it wouldn't, it would go with Both: a flaky baguette.

Duck, duck. Okay, now step forward, step forward, another step forward; okay, go to your right, go to your right.

Do you scrapbook?

On rainy days.

Step forward, go to your left; left, left.

Big step, that's it, big step; now come to me, another big step; come to me.

Do you own yarn?

Spools of it.

I craft so much.

It's a left, and again come to me, come to me.

Yes.

Come to me.

Oh!

Oh!

It's okay, I've got you.

We have a new record.

He's amazing.

I think he might be an angel sent down to Earth like Denzel Washington in The Preacher's Wife.

Oh, honey, okay, what can I do?

In your purse, you will find a white envelope.

Okay, you, you wrote a letter to yourself, and stuck it in my purse?

Read it, I need to hear it.

"Dear Jess, If you are reading this, it's because you're being an idiot and developing feelings for your employee, you ballet-flat-wearing piece of Oregon trash."

You are so right. You are so right.

"To have intercourse with the first man hired under your reign would be an insult to yourself and also..."

This part's in caps.

...all women everywhere."

All women everywhere.

"Did you learn nothing from the movie Elizabeth, you stupid little bitch?"

No one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects.

I will paint my face white.

No man may have me.

Thank you, Cece.

You're welcome?

Teaching is such a pain in the ass.

Isn't it?

I'll tell you what, I wouldn't give it up for anything.

You get to really impact those kids' lives.

I'm not gonna impact them, I'm just teaching health.

"Just health"?

Hey, Carol.

Hey, Ned.

Oh, it's Carol.

Oh, hey, Carol.

Health is the most important subject.

Screw up, and they "just" get pregnant.

What's your safe sex lesson plan?

I don't know!

Uh, lie to them and say condoms feel good?

Uh, maybe tell them about my buddy who's got bumps on his thing?

Maybe bring up Magic Johnson.

Maybe bring up Kobe Bryant.

You're my best friend in the whole world, but I'm really worried about you.

You think the line is a suggestion?

I don't know what it is...

It isn't!

Do it again.

It's too hard!

Do it again!

Okay, so you start with the first tick.

Oh...

That's it, really.

Stop!

That was at the line!

That was perfect.

Now do it ten more times.

So in the beginning, you never mind the edge.

Yeah.

Man.

You got to hold on to it.

What about bleach?

Let's walk before we can run, huh, pal?

Hey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!

(laughs) Man, that is way too soon.

Warm-warm, warm-cold...

You got this, don't get flustered!

Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot? It's hot-hot!

It's always warm-cold.

Well, what's "permanent press"?

Fake button, nobody uses it.

Yeah, don't press that one.

(buzzing) The machine is buzzing, you didn't close it!

What?! Yeah, I closed it!

Who you gonna believe, me or the machine?!

I'm gonna believe the machine!

(grunts)

This is bull!

(buzzing stops)

Damn it, you!

We're so close.

Take ten and relax.

Nine-inch bottle.

Rappers be lying.

You told me to relax, so...

Self-pleasure is the only thing that relaxes me.

Ugh. Seriously, Schmidt?

That is crass.

I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear it.

So stupid.

Hey, you did it!

You did it!

Yes!

Yeah!

All right!

That's what I'm talking about!

Guys' Night!


Hey.

Oh, hey.

I saved you a seat.

Oh! No.

I've been offered a seat at the higher-ups' table.

The tastemakers.

You're not invited.

Oh, I see. You're back to avoiding me.

I'm not av... I don't know what you're talking about.

Yes, you do. You've been avoiding me for weeks at school.

That's why I was so happy that we were finally getting a chance to, I don't know, maybe get to know each other.

What, is this summer camp?

We don't need to get to know each other.

What's your problem with me?

Did I do something to offend you?

Why do... I... I don't have a problem.

You have a problem with me.

I don't have a problem with you.

Yes, you do, you have a problem.

Do you have a problem?

No, I don't have a problem.

Great, then we bothdon't have a problem.

We have a problem.

Coach: Hey, Jess!

Buffer on the roof!

(laughs)

I'm freaking out.

Freakin', freakin' out.

Freak, freak, freak. (dog barks)

Is that a baby? I feel like I hear a baby.

All right, gentlemen... bar crawl.

Man, look at this, I know how to do laundry!

I feel like a new man.

Good, good, good.

There is no way for me to express my joy.

Except by telling you the width of my smile.

(giggles)

(chuckles)

I can't read it, somebody else read it.

No, I want to do it, I want to do it, hold on.

But I can't see, let me turn it... uh...

You know what? To Nick.

What can't you do?

A lot, you know, I can't say "Frebuary."

(laughs) No one can!

Frebuar... Febuar-ar...

Feb.. I... (babbles)

Whatever.

Feb... February.

Yeah, it's February.

I can't say the alphabet unless I'm singing the song.

And I never learned how to love.

But enough about me... Guys' Night!

Let's go, gentlemen.

Winston: Man, that is... that is heavy.

Hey, Nick, that's something we should talk about.

I mean, what are we gonna do, sit around all night and talk about love?

(laughs)

Winston and Schmidt: ♪ I want to know what love is ♪
♪ I want you to show me ♪
♪ Ooh... ♪
♪ I want to know what love is ♪
♪ Oh... ♪
♪ And I want you to sh... ♪
♪ I know you can show me ♪

Sad song.

Hey, buddy.

Hey!

Jess: What's happening?

I freaked out about the whole teaching health thing, and then I went and I-I got drunk with Ned...

Neddy!

And then I bet everybody in the bar that I could do a backflip off the roof, and that's what I came to do.

So...

Hey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Uh, I... I totally understand how you're feeling.

Yeah? Does, uh, teaching scare the crap out of you, Jess?

Well, it is my life's calling, so, no.

Exactly.

You don't get it.

I do.

What's up, player?

It's the British dude.

This is my first time teaching, and I'm scared, too.

It's a terribly important job.

Yeah, but health is the most... (all gasping)

I'm good.

Health is the most important subject on Earth.

Yes, it is important.

'Cause you know kids, they're always wanting to have sex with each other.

They don't know that it just feels good for a second and then you're sad.

And that's why we need someone great, someone strong, who the kids trust.

Okay.

Someone who can yell at them about chlamydia.

That does... that sounds like... like something Coach would do.

You can teach.

I can teach, guys!

That's mostly what I was trying to tell you.

No one needs to worry about me anymore!

No! (all screaming)

Oh, my God.

I'll get him.

No.

Yes.

Don't do anything heroic right now.

(all gasp, exclaim)

(gasping for air)

(cheering)

This guy's amazing.

Nick, Winston and Schmidt: ♪ Hello ♪
♪ Is it me you're looking for? ♪
♪ I can see it in your... ♪

I want to be the someone that somebody is looking for.

-♪ In your smile... ♪

But what do I have to offer?

Do not talk about yourself like that.

Come on, guys, what do I bring to the table?

That's easy, man.

You're the cute one.

What?

That's right.

Look, I'm the smart one, Winston's the silly one, Coach is the sports one, and you're the cute one.

Well, if I were so cute, then how come I can't find anyone to love?

'Cause you're aiming too low.

Nick, my man, you don't find diamonds underground.

That's exactly where you find diamonds, Winston.

Let's... can we not...

This is not about gems, okay?

This is about Nick valuing himself enough to aim for the top.

Now, I-I've been to the top of the mountain, with Cece, and it was glorious up there.

And you know, one of these days... could be tomorrow...

I'm gonna be a millionaire.

If I don't have Cece, then what do I have?

You got a million dollars.

If I'm being honest, you guys, uh...

I'm worried about being a cop.

Sure.

You know, what if I see something really bad and then it... it changes me?

You know, it makes me lose my faith and then I become really bad?

You guys really think I'm the cute one?

You know what's not cute?

Pretending that you don't know that you are.

Schmidt, this sangria is just delicious.

Thanks, man.

I'm jealous of that little orange in there.

It gets to just drink all the sangria it wants.

Yeah. I'm probably gonna...

I'm gonna eat the orange, too.

Guys' Night.

Guys' Night!

(bl*wing)

(whistles)

(whistles)

It's like instant world music.

(tones harmonizing)

(laughing)

Wait, shh.

Why "shh"?

I think he's finally...

(Coach snores) asleep.

Asleep.

(giggles)

Cheers.

Chin-chin.

Um...

Hey...

I'm sorry.

I was a little bit of a jerk to you earlier.

No, it's fine.

I'm used to jerks.

I used to work in finance.

Oh! Finance!

Mm-hmm.

Really?

Why did you leave?

I know this sounds silly, but I realized that the only time I'd been really happy in my life was teaching my little sister how to read.

She suffers from crippling dyslexia.

Oh, God!

What?

You're just... so perfect.

Well, it's more common than you might think.

No, you're like the most perfect person I've ever met. And it's like you're an angel who's been sent down to the Earth, like... have you ever seen the movie The Preacher's Wife?

Anyway, I just have this big, stupid crush on you.

I... didn't say that.

No, it's fine. It's-it's...

Shouldn't have said... No.

I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry, um...

I need a bucket.

Now!

Um, you should go.

I need a bucket!

(gags) Just go.

No, let me help, please. Let me help.

No, just go, just go, just go.

Coach: Ugh, gettin' the mouth sweats.

Oh, I need a bucket!

Just go.

Just go. Just go.

Okay.

Why is there ice in here?

More room... (sighs) for what's about to happen...

Oh, God...

Oh, my God!

When I get home I'm hitting the books.

I am going to crush health.

Yeah, you are.

Yeah.

Ned!

Let me get his contact before we leave.

What?

Ned! I need details, bro!

Hey, man. Am I gonna get your e-mail?

What's gonna happen here?

Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.

Let's do it, let's do it.

Yeah.

It's therealned8(a)guhmail.com.

At guhmail... you mean Gmail?

Oh, is that how you say it?

Um... (chuckles)

Good morning.

Good morning.

Can I, um... talk to you about last night?

No, I want to talk to you about last night, because I said some things, um, that don't reflect how I really feel about you.

Um... so I'd really appreciate it if you could strike them from the record.

It was the conference talking, not me.

Consider them struck.

Thank you.

Enjoy your Thanksgiving vacation.

It's, uh, an American holiday where we celebrate the fact that we... didn't know how to farm by ourselves.

Are you curious to know how I really feel about you?

No.

Because if you were interested, I'd tell you that I won't enjoy my Thanksgiving because I won't get to see you every day.

I think you're beautiful and totally insane, and when I'm at work, I can't focus, because I can't get you out of my head.

Coach: Hey.

Hey, uh, you guys want to stop on the way home and get some pancakes?

Hey, what do you call them in England?

Roundy-yums.

Really?

No.

See you after the holidays.

Oh, boy.

You didn't see anything!

Where'd your lipstick go?

h*t 'em! h*t 'em!

From the back.

h*t 'em!

Ugh!

It smells terrible in here!

How many beers did you guys drink?

So much.

Beer, beer! Lots of beer.

Just a lot of beer.

That's how beer smells.

So many beers.

(sniffs)

Smells like sangria.

Schmidt: That must be the perfume from all the ladies we hooked up with. Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

They were all Spaniards.

Winston: Mine was named Señorita Lucinda Madrid.

Say, how was the conference?

It was just... stupid... conferences...

Ugh.

So, she finally hooked up with Ryan.

He put his teeth behind her teeth.

Wow!

Aah!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

What the hell did you guys do to my blanket?





Gentlemen!

Three months ago I bravely reentered the dating pool, and how has this city rewarded me? With an endless parade of weirdo ass clowns. Hard to say who was the worst. Comedy magician. This guy with the little ding dang. The lion tamer.

Never went out with a lion tamer.

I am having some vivid dreams.

The point is Ian has asked me out on a third date, and this is the biggest compliment I could give.

I want to go. Because I like him.

Booh!

That's not a reason.

And frankly it's been a while, and the third date is where, # mama gets her biscuit. #

(chuckles)

Mama gets her biscuit.

I don't understand.

It's sex.

Oh!

Yeah!

Now, that's a reason!

Anyway, I'm bringing him home tonight, so let's keep those toilets flushed.

That means stick around. Take a second look.

How'd you tell Ian about the fun surprise that you still live with your ex?

All right.

Well, I haven't told him yet.

Uh, tricky conversation.

I'm thinking of something simple like, "Hey, Ian, I live with my ex."

No. No, no. When a guy hears that, he is going to run through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.

Here's a fun idea. You can put a hat on him with antlers.

This way, the hole he makes in the wall will make us all smile.

Nick brings home girls all the time.

There's no problem.

No complaints here.

It'll make you forget every botanical garden you've ever seen.

I live with my ex-girlfriend.

And after the farmer's market...

I live with my ex.

Let's have sex again.

I live with my ex.

(sighs)

Damn it. Too quick.

Hey, if you're looking to scare somebody off, it's basically a gold mine.

Nobody cares that we're exes who live together.

(groans) I got to go.

Okay, that doesn't prove anything.

Just for the record, I'm leaving 'cause you live with your ex.

It's gross. And disgusting.

And I'm gonna steal some stuff.

Take what you want, honey.

Coach: We don't read those anymore.

(door closes)

Nick, who are these girls?

They're not the best.

Jess, guys hate complicated situations.

We want the path of least resistance.

There's a flap in our underwear because we are too lazy to pull our underpants down.

No offense, Nick, but...

Ian's a little different from you or the women you bring home.

The... tavern folk.

Have some respect. They're called Uh-Ohs.

And I've been through a lot of names: Pork Pals.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Bone Cronies, Right.

C-Plussy Hussies.

Very reverent.

But "Uh-Oh" takes it off of them and back onto me where it belongs.

I made the mistake, not them. They're great.

You really are a prince among men, Nick.

Aw, that's awfully nice. I feel like I'm maturing.

All I'm saying is that, somehow, Ian is even more mature than you are.

And that's why I think he'll understand when I tell him in a mature adult way I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about.

Can I suggest a tweak?

Fine.

"I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about because he's gay now."

No.

"Because he has weeks to live."

No.

"Because he's already d*ad."

What?

Then I'll act like a ghost.

No.

(imitating ghost): Consider it.

No.

Come on.

That's the worst ghost impression I've ever heard.

This is the worst ghost impression you've ever heard?

(imitating ghost): I'm a ghost.

(scoffs) There's way worse.

(Winston humming softly)

Anything for me?

Oh, no, this isn't our mail. This is our neighbors' mail.

You see, Viv likes it alphabetized.

Yet Michelle likes it according to size. (chuckles)

Hashtag "go figure," right?

Hashtag "did you see how I rhymed?"

I want to choke you until your eyes literally pop out of your head.

Those girls are not going to sleep with you.

They are hot. And nothing is less hot than a male secretary.

(imitates record scratching)

What?

I think somebody needs to take a good long look at Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Dude's eyes are so pouchy he can barely see anything, and he's still k*lling it.

Girls don't have sex with guys who sort their mail.

I am playing the long game here, Coach, weaving myself into the fabric of their lives.

Pretty soon I'll be as permanent as the will that I helped them draw up.

Oh, Winston, thank God you're here.

The toilet won't flush.

Did you jiggle the handle?

No, it's not working for us.

Here.

Oh.

I'm not here to do any chores.

You guys want to hang out tonight?

Sure.

Sure.

Right on.

Right on. That's what's up.

Winston: Coach, I really need my stilts and a plunger!

Eh, I don't care.

I'm happy to lend you a bra, but I don't think I have anything that would fit you.

That's the Peter Pan.

That'll smash 'em down good, but you'll never get those in there.

I know. I just wanted to see what it would feel like to be your size.

Are we doing, like, a boob Freaky Friday?

Because I don't want to lug yours around. They're a load.

I know. That's the whole point. That's why all the women in my family have back trouble, you know?

(groans)

So, now that I have insurance though, I was thinking maybe I could have, like, breast reduction surgery.

Schmidt (in distance): No!

(footsteps running)

(frantic knocking) I wonder who this is.

What?

It's a boob reduction, Schmidt.

Just accept it.

Acceptance is stage five.

I'm grieving, Cece. There are five stages of grief.

Stage one was denial.

This is not happening, this is not...

Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

You're not getting a boob reduction.

Yes, I am.

This is not happening.

Yes, it is.

Stage two was anger.

Your breasts belong to all of us!

Okay.

Who are you to decide?!

Next will be stage four, depression.

And then stage five, acceptance.

But right now, I'm firmly planted in stage three, bargaining.

Dear God, if you stop Cece's breast reduction, Okay.

I'll circumcise Coach.

Whoa, Coach.

Go out with them tonight? Doesn't make any sense, man.

And compromise the long game? Ha.

Not until I replace their rocker switches with dimmers.

Forget your long game, Winston! Getting a girl to have sex with you is not about planning ahead.

It is about seizing opportunities that you never saw coming. It is instinct.

All right? It is improv.

It is jazz, man.

But with words. You dig? And the words are, "Oh, yeah, girl, I'm about to..."

(scatting loudly)

(phone vibrating)

(humming quietly)

(chuckles) Glen, my man, tell me something good.

And you better not be trying to sell me some non-dimmable halogens, you son of a...

Where you at? Are you kidding me?

(sighs)

Hey, buddy.

You know what you need to surround yourself with tonight?

Four new boobs.

On two different women?

You're damn right.

Take me to them.

(laughs)

Um, do you want to, like, go find a bar, grab a drink?

There's a bar that I like.

It's called... my place.

Great. Uh, is it... You think it'll be crowded?

You know I'm talking about my house, right?

Okay. Yeah, no, I wasn't... I thought that was just a clever name but now I do.

No.

And, yeah, let's go there.

(laughs)

Um, one thing I want to, uh, disclose to you in a very mature adult way, I... live with my ex.

Okay. Uh, yeah, you live with your ex.

Yeah.

But also three other guys.

It's more zany than sexy.

Okay. So it, like, wasn't really serious?

Oh, it was very serious.

Did you say "I love you"?

Not until he said it. (chuckles)

Uh, yeah, I don't think I can do this.

I'm sorry. I just...

What?

I've been on so many weird dates lately. I'm just looking for something easier.

I... No, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, look.

Yes, I live with my ex.

But there's nothing to worry about.

Because...

Nick. You're gay.

Huh?

You're gay.

Be gay. Be gay. Be gay.

Be gay?

Hey. (chuckles)

I just had to make sure these animals flushed.

Oh. Not you, you fastidious queen.

Oh, y-you must be Nick.

Well, friends call me Gay Nick.

My perfect Sunday, sitting here watching the game, eating a pot pie with a hot dude with no shirt on, on my lap kissing me.

Right on, man. Right on, man.

All right.

You got it.

(imitates expl*si*n)

Uh, can I use your restroom?

Yeah. It's down the hall to the right.

Don't worry. I won't peek.

But he wants to.

(chuckles)

Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

I should just tell him the truth.

It's too late for the truth, Jess.

You live with a gay man, and this gay man's gonna help you get laid.

Okay. Thank you.

You're welcome.

Do you think you can play a gay man?

I'm terrible at lying, I'm terrific at make-believe.

Okay.

Okay? But I need to know some backstory 'cause it's very important to me.

Okay. Yeah, backstory's important.

Okay.

Tell me, have I always known I was gay, or did I just recently realize it?

That's... Um, you-you always knew you were gay, but you grew up in an oil town where masculinity was the most valued currency.

Um, you-you had an older brother named Chip.

And Chip was a union guy.

Yes.

And if it wasn't about Teamster Local 11, Chip didn't want to hear about it.

Oh, my God, we're doing this.

When I came out, was it flashy?

Was it emotional?

Am I mad that Anderson Cooper doesn't fly the flag?

Or for what he's doing in his own way... is it even braver?

These are all really good questions, but I just can't get my mind off, like, why you dress this way.

Why aren't you in better shape?

Don't put me in a box!

There's nothing we gay men hate more than being put in a box.

Look, maybe I'm a bear, maybe I'm a twinkler.

That's not a category.

I like rugby for the game and for the men.

Now, if you excuse me, I got to go do that gay thing I was telling you about, because, of course, I'm gay as hell.

(laughs) Bye.

(whispers): That's not how gay men talk.

(whispers): I am shattering stereotypes.

What are you doing here, man?

Winston: I'm always here.

Very definition of the long game.

Coach: Forget your long game. It doesn't...

What is he...?

What are you doing, man?

Is this...?

Is this the fut... the future?

I can hold them both in one hand.

Yeah, man.

(sighs)

No, no, there it is. Look at that.

Stage four... depression.

My two best friends are going away.

Going away far too soon.

And if you were lucky enough to meet them, to touch them, to be touched by them, you came away a better person.

If you'll excuse me.

Is he... is he talking about you guys?

Yes. Yes, he is, uh... he's talking about us.

We are, unfortunately, we're going away... tomorrow.

So, uh, we better make tonight count, huh, ladies?

Wait.

We barely got to know you!

How long will you be gone?

For... for... 44 weeks.

44 weeks?

Tell them about our business, man.

You don't have to be shy about it.

Uh, right.

No. Yeah.


Hello. Do you like socks?

We sell socks.

Everybody likes socks.

I just cried on my penis while I was peeing.

Whoa.

Schmidt: That happened.

I just can't stop thinking about them.

(sighs)

You know, there are some people that are gonna say that they... they look alike.

That they're exactly the same. And you know what?

They just don't know them like I know them.

Truth-truth be told?

One of them...

One of them is slightly more brown than the other.

And they're so unique, and they're so special.

You know what I'm gonna miss most about them?

Watching them bounce.

Watching them...

Watching them bounce.

If you just give me a chance to exp...

Well, easy come, easy go.

Easy? Easy?!

You just stole six months of my life, man.

I am... I am P.O.'d, hombre!

Winston!

Can I get a high five?

Bam.

(laughs)

Sorry I called you a biscuit.

I'm sorry I liked it so much. (laughs)

(knocking) NICK: Hey, Jess, you in there?

Is that Nick?

Do you mean Gay Nick?

Yeah, that's Gay Nick.

I am so sorry.

What's going on?

I screwed up. (door opens)

A girl, Nick?

I know.

Nick, really?

(laughs): Hey.

(laughs)

You look like my d*ad friend Karen.

Does anyone ever tell you that?

Hmm, no.

Thank you.

Mm.

(door closes) What?!

I wanted to be gay for you, I really did, but it's a very hard time to be gay.

Girls are wearing scarves and boots.

They have so many layers to them.

What is underneath all those layers? I want to find out!

Are you blaming autumn?

Look, it was one night. Get rid of her!

I tried. I told her I live with my ex, and she didn't care.

You look so cute in the morning. (laughs)

You talking to me or her? (laughter)

(door closes) Okay. I'll get rid of her.

I'll just pretend to be your crazy ex-girlfriend.

I can do this. I did a one-woman production of A Christmas Carol.

(British accent): You, sir, what day is it?

Aye, it's Christmas day.

That was not good.

It was perfect.

Thank you. I thought you'd think that.

Yeah, it's perfect.

All right, look, you stay here and keep your gay warm, okay?

In case Ian comes back. Also, can we agree that this is not the most mature way to handle things?

Even though it's pretty fun.

It's no fun a couple Bellinis and a round of apples to apples can't solve.

What kind of gay are you?

I'm still finding it.

All right.

All right.

Nick thinks we're broken up, but he also thinks that the last girl he slept with wasn't me in a wig.

(laughs)

Wigs are so good for tricking guys.

I'm around all the time.

Do you really want to get yourself in this situation?

My last boyfriend was, like, honestly in his 80s.

I was just like, "Don't die, Myron."

Does that answer your question?

Tell me everything you did sexually!

Everything! All of it, or leave!

I put my finger...

Stop!

But you asked...

No.

I-I did, but it backfired.

Winston: Ah, so it is load bearing, huh?

What are you doing?

Me? Oh, well, first, I'm putting up the shelves.

Then I got to finish the floor, so that the shelves can appear level, then the ceiling.

Enough! All right? You've done enough for these women.

Look, ladies, I tried to manipulate you, and I am sorry about that, but you guys have been manipulating my friend for months.

It is not okay. Just dangling sex like a little carrot.

We are not using sex to get Winston to do stuff.

No.

Wait. You're not?

No.

Well, then he's done doing stuff.

Come on, Winston. You're better than this.

Forget you guys.

Wait!

Yeah, just-just give us a minute.

Okay, we have to talk about...

Okay.

What are they whispering about?

I don't know.

We could just stack the books.

No... No.

Oh, man, this is embarrassing.

Uh...

Okay. It's me.

Come on.

What?

Wait. Listen. Um...

Michelle, you don't have to do this.

That's okay. I kind of want to.

Just, uh, keep the pencil behind your ear, and bring the hard hat, um, and the safety goggles.

(whispers): Long game.

(sighs)

Wonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.

Well, you know women.

What's women?

(laughs)

(laughs): Am I right?

"What's women?"

I just don't know them like you know them, is my point.

Uh-huh.

Uh, so, what kind of guys do you like to date?

Me? All kinds.

Yeah.

Hunks. If I can get my, uh, paws on a hunk, I don't let go.

Uh, ripped nerds.

'Cause they're smart but strong, I guess.

Uh-huh.

I like Spanish guys.

Throw in a little, uh, hint of German in there, there's a perfect combo.

Okay.

Certain ice cream men, I guess.

Carpet steamers. Sleepy guys.

Uh, we in the gay community call them "drowsers."

Why would you like a sleepy guy?

Look... I'm so out of the game...

I'm in a relationship.

Um... he's got a nice penis.

You're sweating a lot.

That's what he said! Am I right?

(laughs)

I'm a sweaty lover, is what he says to me.

Okay, you know, you really don't seem gay.

I don't buy it.

Hey. Not now.

Probably wondering why I didn't come home last night.

Just needed some space to process this whole thing.

I'm sorry if our room felt empty.

(sighs)

Well, it did.

I was really worried about you.

So where were you? You owe me that much.

I just went walking on the streets last night.

I needed to come to terms with all this.

Ended up in a park. I know that's stupid, but I promise I was careful.

I mean, I was totally safe.

A park?

I don't know, man.

Hey, I'm upset... but I understand.

It's okay.

Come here.

Come here.

(sighs) There, there.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Acceptance. Wow.

Yeah.

Give me a kiss.

Just give me a kiss.

All right?

I felt like you needed that more than I did.

(sighs)

You're scruff, by the way, is perfect.

Don't touch your beard trimming setting.

Okay.

Take it easy.

Okay.

That was beautiful.

I'm-I'm sorry, you know?

I think I'm just more used to, like, stereotypical gay guys, like him, you know?

You offended me.

I'm sorry.

Ian! Ian! Hi. There are some events that are about to occur that I'd like to get ahead of.

Um, the truth is that Nick is...

Oh, God.

Get off of me!

You're not a man!

Ian! Wait. I'm so sorry I lied, and you don't owe me anything, but could I just ask you one thing before you leave?

What is this, an exit interview?

Is there any good way I could have told you about my living situation?

Okay, you know what? Fair question. Um... no!

Look, Nick was just trying to help me. Clearly, he would do anything for you. I mean, he went so far as to hire an actual gay man to play his cheating lover.

What? Oh, my God. You know what?

I think that was Schmidt.

He's... not gay.

When are the lies gonna stop?!

Now, this is just a consultation, so do your best to relax.

Okay.

Stop the surgery!

This is just a consultation.

May we have the room, please?

That's what it's here for.

I'm sorry.

What are you doing?!

Okay, look, I know I can't stop this, and I accept that, but I just wanted to stop it long enough so that I could say good-bye.

Aw. Look, this is a low-risk procedure, okay?

I'm gonna be fine.

Oh, you meant say good-bye to my boobs.

I forgot who I was talking to.

No, Schmidt, you cannot see my boobs.

I need to look them in the eyes. I can't let them leave without knowing how much they've meant to me.

I'll let them know.

No.

I need to tell them myself.

(groans) All right... you can say good-bye to one, all right?

I mean, j-just one?

One.

(sighs) Gosh almighty.

The Ultimate Sophie's Cho-Cho.

I mean, there's Harold, who's just... full of life...

(groans)

(sighs) And Kumar, who's shy.

Who's shy, but yet surprisingly so brave.

But, you know, who wouldn't be with a best friend like Harold?

Oh, my God, fine!

You can say good-bye to both, okay?

Okay. I need you to put these on.

What?

This is a private conversation that doesn't concern you.

The playlist... matches the mood.

("Canon in D" playing)

(music fades)

I mean, I guess if I'm being honest, it doesn't matter what size you are. I'm always gonna love you, because you're attached to the most beautiful person in the whole world.

(music resumes)

You know what I think? I think that when people go on dates with us, probably talk to their friends and their friends say, "You go on dates with a lot of weirdos."

(shower running)

Oh, my God. We're the weirdo ass clowns.

Aw, no. Everyone in their 30s waits in line for the shower.

I'm sorry, but the truth is, as long as you live with me, you're not gonna meet a normal guy.

(Jess chuckles)

Why are you guys all in here?

Winston's taking a long-ass shower.

Poor guy gets dirty.

All right, let me see the new.

I accept it.

Again, it was just a consultation. And actually, I don't even know if I'm gonna go through with it.

You're still here. I saved you.

I'm your Schindler. One day, your children are gonna put rocks on my grave.

Hey, uh, wow. You guys mind if I get cuts? 'Cause I am very dirty.

Wait a minute.

Who's in the sh...

Hey, what's the vibe here on shower pee-pee?

I'm just trying to plan my day.

Who is this woman?!

You have awesome water pressure. You should see what's falling out of my hair.

Well, Nick... looks like you're gonna have to marry her.

It's looking that way, isn't it?

Yeah.

She's not so bad.

She's peeing in the shower.

Yeah, she is.

(laughs) That's weird.

Classic Tina.





Cece went on a date last night?

Schmidt, why don't you just read my text messages while I'm in the shower like you normally do?

Our Cece has taken a lover? Good for him.

Don't get weird, Schmidt.

I'm not being weird.

I just said good for him.

You know, I've camped in that forest, too The babbling brook, the beautiful mountains, little secret trailway that's only open seasonally, and when it is, let me tell you something, bring a camera.

Cool, not weird at all.

Good, you're all here.

I just got a tip from my buddy Dugan.

My academy background check is today and I need everybody's help.

Can't do it, bro.

Going to the outlet mall today. I'm gonna look like a rich person from three years ago.

Can't... You can't go to the outlet mall today. Not today.

Yeah, you can't go to the outlet mall today.

Why?

It's a weekend... what are you, crazy? Unless you got a game plan.

I have a game plan.

Schmidt: Grab a quick smoothie, power up.

Do my leg stores first. Pants, socks, shoes.

Hats and accessories last, then one sweet treat for the road. Most likely a cinnamon pretzel.

I'm in. (laughs)

That sounds like a tight afternoon.

I'm in for sure.

What the hell, dude?

I do want to be part of the pretzel.

This is my life. If I don't pass the background check, then I fail out of the police academy.

Guys, this is an all-hands-on-deck situation.

If we don't help him, Winston will never become a cop. Remember?

He-He handcuffed his cat's paw to a radiator and then lost the key.

In my defense, I was making a Christmas card, so...

Okay, you know what... I'm gonna cancel my plans with Cece.

I'll find out about her date with Paul later.

A ridiculous name. Oh, hey, my name is Puh-ha... Pau... I don't even know how to pronounce that.

It's Paul.

I'll take that Paul, I'll take him to a water park, I will.

I'll put him on one of those waterslides between two obese people and he'll get smushed to death.

Die in a... Die in a water... He'll die between the obese people before he drowns in the water.

What?

Hmm?

Schmidt, that is exactly the kind of talk we can't have today when the LAPD comes here.

Um... the, uh, cops are coming here?

Yes.

Like, here, here?

Yes.

Like, to our home, w-where we keep our stuff?

Why can't we just go there? We'll just go there, a-answer some questions, get an ice coffee on the way back... I really feel like ice coffee.

It's a home visit, Jess.

And not just from any cop. It's from Sergeant Tess Dorado. The Fish.

I'm pretty sure they call her The Fish because she's tough but fair, just like most fish I've interacted with.

Winston, "Dorado" is a fish.

It's a subset of mahi-mahi and it pairs very nicely with citrus, you oaf.

I'm not a oaf, you're a oaf, stupid.

So... You're dumb. Shut up.

Also, put on some underpants, please. It's like a bounce house down there.

Do you guys think that the cops are gonna go through our stuff?

What are you afraid of? They'll look through your dream journal?

No, I just...

What, are you running a sweatshop back there for skirts that look like curtains?

Actually...

What'd you- What'd you, steal a kiss and hide it in an envelope?

(all laugh)

I have a bag of meth in my closet.

Oh, I know it's in here somewhere...

Oh, oh, ooh. These are my "bad decision" hats.

Bad decision, right?

How do you not know where a bag of meth is?

Find it and get rid of it.

Find it, get rid of it.

Jess, why do you have meth in your closet?

Do you remember that day when I was trying to convince you guys to come with me to that waffle restaurant in the Antelope Valley that I found?

And you were like, "That's way too far to go for waffles."

Turns out you were right... How good can a waffle really be?

That's the question I answered that...

Tell us the story faster.

Your waffle story sucks.

Where is the bag of crystal methamphetamine, you dummy?

Okay, fine. Do you see that footstool?

I bought it at a garage sale.

Turns out the top opens up and when I opened up the top, I found... here it is... this.

Coach: Holy frickin' what?

(whoops)

Aah!

Oh, hey. How do I look?

Terrible.

N- Not for me.

Not great.

Like crap.

Go change.

I don't like any of it.

Wow. You guys are like rubbing alcohol.

You sting me in the now, but save me in the later.

All right.

Okay, Winston cannot find out about this.

Because if he doesn't know, he can't get in trouble, and he's probably already failing out of the academy as it is.

Also, why are you keeping this in your closet?

What am I supposed to do, notify the authorities? I'm sorry, Officer, I found this bag of meth in a footstool I bought at a garage sale. Uh, no.

My closet is safe. The only person who goes in there is me when I'm naked and/or sad.

Hey. Much better, right?

I found it on the lawn.

(chuckles)

And that's the whole story.

So, you guys ready? She's on her way.

Why don't you go wait for her downstairs?

Don't make her buzz up like a shawarma boy.

Good idea, good idea.

This way, I get to tell her my sidewalk joke.

You remember the sidewalk joke, right?

There's a man on the s...

How's it...? There's a man on the...

Oh, you know, okay...

Everybody just calm down.

Especially you, Nick, you're already sopping wet.

Lying makes me sweat. I can't lie.

It's why I don't play poker or talk to pregnant ladies.

No one has to lie. I'm just going to get rid of it.

(mutters anxiously)

I'm gonna call Cece.

She knows about this stuff.

She lived one summer in Milan with a guy named Crystal Randy.

Ask her about the date.

Hey, Cece, quick question. How does one get rid of a bag of meth? Call me back.

Ask her if Paul is taller than me.

Stop it.

Did she surrender her virtue?

Hey.

Throw it in the trash.

I can't see it.

I can't see where it goes, 'cause then when she comes in here, I'll just yell "trash!" I'll yell "trash!"

Cover your ears and sing "Landslide."

Schmidt: Let's call Cece again.

# Took my love and I took it down d... #

We need to get this back in my closet...

I could see your lips moving.

Well, close your eyes.

(Nick singing)

Throw it out the window, okay?

I'll sneak down there, I'll toss it in the Dumpster. Here.

Oh!

Jess: Oh, my God!

What the heck, Jess?

Jess: I threw like a boy!

I've always thrown like a boy!

You almost h*t me in the face!

What are you, nuts?

Overhand?

Oh, well, Winston's a goner.

You know, this building used to be a biscuit factory.

And apparently, the mice have not been told it's gone residential.

Was that a joke?

I hate jokes.

# ...of changing #

Jess: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

# 'Cause I built We just have to hide this. #

# My whole life around you Throw it in here. #

Come on!

I was bringing it to you!

Why does everybody keep asking me to throw stuff?

Schmidt: Work on your aim!

This is actually a really good song.

Nick, stop singing!

Where are we gonna put this?

Put it in the baggie!

Fun Saturday?

No. My bird d*ed.

Well, my mom used to say when a bird dies, he gets another set of wings in heaven, so...

Well, that bird was going straight to hell.

Welcome to our home.

I will ask you questions. You will ask me no questions.

In pursuit of that, I will offer up three personal facts: I was born in St. Louis, I have three brothers, two of whom were k*lled in separate plane crashes, and...

I like music.

Good? Good.

Now, let's get started...

My name is Nick.

Nicholas Miller?

I- I don't... I don't know.

Schmidt: Hah!

He's just messing around with you.

He's our resident clown here.

Dorado: Let's keep this simple.

I need to be home in time to feed my bird.

Oh, God.

(light clattering)

Uh, green grape? Would you like...?

No, thanks.

I already had my grapes.

Jess!

I got your message.

Where's the freaking me...

Play along, or Jess goes to jail.

What are you doing?

Hey.

Look, it's my girlfriend Cece.

What's up, Cece?

Ah, it's his girlfriend Cece.

Winston: Girlfriend? Oh, my goodness, you guys are back together?

Yeah.

No, uh...

Like I always say, you can't put peanut butter and jelly on the same shelf and expect 'em not to mix.

'Cause somebody got to eat a sandwich.

It's exciting.

Yeah, no.

Moving on. Miss Day, in your own words, please state why Cadet Bishop would be an asset to the Los Angeles Police Department.

A few kind words. Known me for a long time.

Yeah.

It's your boy Winnie the Bish.

Oh!

(light clattering)

I have to go to the bathroom.

Winston: If you guys will excuse me for just one second.

Okay.

Will somebody answer the question so I can write it on the form and we can get on with our lives?

Why would Bishop make a good police officer?

Mustache.

I'm sorry?

Because, uh, Winston has a mustache.

And, uh, police officers all have mustaches.

No, they don't. Not the ladies.

Unless the ladies want to.

Why can't a lady have a mustache?

She can. And it would look sexy.

Would you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth? Handed to your mouth?

I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.

No, he- he would. He definitely would.

Yeah, he would.

You know, Winston has done plenty for, uh, the, um... community.

He has a little brother at the Boys & Girls Club.

Of course. All the work that Winston does with the Boys & Girls Club that he actually does in real life.

So much work at the Boys & Girls Club.

Yeah. So passionate.

What was his little brother's name again?

Duke.

Juan.

Duquan is his name.

Duquan.

Duquan. Duquan.

And I'm Nick Miller.

Hey, let me ask you s... um...

Hmm?

Breasts.

It's my cycle.

Already?

Damn, girl. My calendar is way off on you.

You must be, what, like, ten days early?

Aw, Winston. Someday you're gonna make some lucky girl really uncomfortable. Can you go get Cece and tell her to meet me in the bathroom?

Sure. And, girl, uh, you ain't got a cycle... you got a roller coaster.

(chuckles) Don't I know it, girl?

Mm-hmm.

(growls, chuckles)

Duquan Feldman?

I'm gonna make a note to call the Boys & Girls Club.

No!

Why not?

Uh, because he's coming here.

Why would... why would Duquan come- come here?

Because he comes here every Saturday.

He does?

Then where is he?

Huh?

It's Saturday. Where is he?

He's at the bus station. He's waiting for, uh, one of us to get him, and, uh...

You know what? I'll go do it. You guys stay put.

You're gonna go and get Duquan?

I think so.

Yeah.

You guys, anybody want to... come... with? No?

(sighs) Where are you, Duquan?

Hey. Cece, Jess needs some help with some lady stuff.

Of course.

You know how we do.

(chuckles)

Schmidt: Whoof...

Gonna...

Must be a rough one.

You know what, I'm gonna have a look around.

What a great i... You know what, you should start with Nick and I's room. We share it.

Hey, don't mind the condoms. We've been banging like rabbits.

Not each other.

What are you doing? Jessica.

No, Jessica! What are you doing? You do not put drugs down the shower drain. Have you never seen a drug movie before?

I don't know. I saw <i>Ray.</i>

That does not count.

I might have ruined Winston's chances of being a cop.

Well, we can cry about that later. We are gonna take the drugs now and we're gonna go flush 'em, all right?

What are you doing? Come on. Help me. Pick up the drugs, Jess.

I think that the meth entered my bloodstream through my boob skin.

That is not a thing.

That's not how drugs work.

I'm the one on meth! Don't tell me how drugs work!

Okay.

(toilet gurgling)

Oh, my God.

(exhaling anxiously)

Could you open this trunk?

Oh, I'll do more than open it.

I don't know why I said that.

I'm gonna open the trunk.

(whispers): I think I'm having a heart att*ck.

What are you... Oh, my God.

You're a mess. Here. Cover up. Cover...

No, I'm not putting that... I'm not putting on your kimono. It legitimizes you owning it.

Just put it on. Put it on.

Okay.

I'm wearing a kimono.

I see that. Why?

Why? Why is he still wearing pants? That's the real question.

(creaking, clanging)

What's all that going on out there?

I'm on drugs. I'm on drugs...

What's all that clanging?

Uh, just a bunch of clanging.

Well, there's feminine issues...

It's probably the ladies playing with their jewelry.

Their brooches.

You know how... Brooches. Of course.

Nick makes a very good point.

I'm gonna go check on that right now, actually.

Uh, Winston, why don't you show the good sergeant Jess' room?

What?

What a great idea.

Oh, I've had intercourse in there.

You'll be excited to...

I think I'm gonna take off, too.

Nick, what is going on out there?

What's going on out there?

No, I'm asking you what's going on.

Hmm?

What's going on?


(grunting quietly)

It's gonna be okay.

Hey, what happened to the "turlet"?

Schmidt, you're here. So we're in a little bit of a thing right now, but you're our best cleaner.

We might be out of towels, but you'll figure out something.

Right? It's gonna be fun.

Jess, are you crying right now?

I don't know.

I hadn't noticed. Um... (sniffles)

I might be on drugs.

You gonna help mop or are you just gonna try to kiss me again?

Oh, please.

You kissed me back. Your... I felt your lips surrender. And who's this Paul anyway? Paul.

What, does he work in a pizzeria?

Yes, Schmidt, I went on a date with a guy named Paul.

You just need to get over it.

Paul. Paul. Nice name, dude.

Why is your shirt off?

I've seen <i>New Jack City</i>, okay?

They all take their shirts off in the cr*ck cocaine lab!

Ah, it won't go down!

Hats off to the hillbilly that made this meth.

Meth?

What meth?

This meth.

It's... legal meth.

It's... medical meth.

For my... cramps.

Wait a minute. Who's with Nick? d I took my love and I took it down d d I drove around and I h*t a pound d d And I saw all the puppies with their d d Eyes so blind...

Nick! Nick!

Sergeant Dorado, don't listen to him! He's deranged!

I'm gonna talk to this man alone.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

That is not good.

No.

So, this Paul...

I've never seen someone sweat so much in my life. It looks like your body is crying.

What are you hiding?

Distraction!

Okay. You're a tough cookie.

And that's the last thing I'll say.

Look...

Okay, you want the truth? I'll tell you everything.

When I was 13 years old, I once made love to myself behind a post office.

Oh.

Hey!

(honks horn)

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

Yo! What's up? You in the shorts.

Hey, come here, man. Come here. I need a little boy.

(chuckles) Whoa. No. That's not what I meant. No, no, no.

I didn't mean... You know what I'm... Ah.

I wasn't trying to...

It's for my friend, you know?

I need you to come over to, uh, hang out with my friends.

No, not like that. I just need you to pretend like, uh, you're in a relationship with this grown man that I know. Ah! Ah! Uh, I did not think this through. Did not think this through.

Um, bad decision. Very bad decision.

I'm gonna go now. Don't remember my face.

Forget this face. This didn't happen.

What is wrong with the name Paul, okay?

Paul is a normal name. He is a normal guy.

That <i>is</i> the problem, okay?

You shouldn't be with a normal guy.

All right, okay.

It was Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

What? You... you were... you were with Zack Morris?

Mm-hmm.

Guy's a frigging god.

I mean, all right. I've... I surrender.

That's awes... Can I come to the wedding?

(laughs) You think Slater and Screech are gonna be there?

(laughing): I'm kidding. I just wanted to freak you out.

You really had me going there for a second.

(laughing) It works every time with you.

It's amazing. Now...

There was a real second there where I had bad feelings towards Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and I didn't like any moment of that.

How dare you. Don't ever do that to me again.

When I was nine years old, I fed cereal flakes to a frog, and it d*ed.

Then I went into a period of time where I fed cereal flakes to all little animals.

Squirrels can live through it, chipmunks can live through it.

Anything that lives half in and out of water dies, and I don't understand why.

When I was ten, I once walked by my mother sleeping, and I snuck in the room, and I put a lemon in her mouth.

When I was 11, I once tried on my girl cousin's wool tights, and I didn't hate the way it felt!

Why are you telling me this?

Because you said you wanted to hear everything!

My sixteenth year, I never got an erection.

I thought they were done.

I thought my penis was d*ad.

It wasn't.

It's fine, Winston. We can fix this.

Just help me mule this crank.

I'll prepare, you mule.

I can't mule crank. I don't have the system.

It's the perfect plan. I don't think it is.

Jess, do you know how much time we could get for possessing this much meth? Why'd you hide it from me?

I was trying to protect you.

I should've been the first person you told!

I could've taken care of it, or something.

Now it just looks like we're hiding it.

I just...

I didn't... I didn't think there was anything you could do.

And- and why is that?

Because... I don't know!

Because you don't see me as a cop. None of you do.

I didn't... I didn't think you'd make it this far.

We always thought you'd change your mind.

I mean... you say a prayer every time you get on a escalator.

Why risk it?

I just... never really saw you as a... as a cop.

Sorry.

Oh, there it is.

Okay. Okay.

You know what? I know exactly what I have to do.

I'm gonna tell her it's mine.

What?! No. No.

Yes. Maybe I'm not supposed to be a cop.

There's no reason you should lose your job, too.

I once changed a sign that said "Happy Jewish New Year" to "Happy Newish Jew Year."

Is that a hate crime? Stop talking, stop sweating.

What is wrong with you people?! Enough!

Sarge, I have something I need to tell you.

Wait! Sergeant!

My name is Jessica Day, and this is my meth.

Dorado: What?!

Jess, No. I won't accept that. So...

The bathroom is covered in meth.

Meth that belongs to me.

And it may have intoxicated me through the skin on my breasts.

But I assure you, no one here had any prior knowledge of any of this.

Especially Winston.

And I don't want him to go down for my mistake.

You'd be lucky to have him as a cop.

Take me downtown to the all-lady fur factory.

Okay, cuff me.

Somebody bring me handcuffs. I'm guilty.

Is she cuffing me?

I can't see what's going on up there.

Do you feel anything?

Does meth make you feel, like, normal, but, like... like your face feels, like, scratchy?

Oh, no, that's just the carpet on my face.

Here's the way this is gonna go down.

I'm gonna go in the bathroom, have a look around.

You will stay here.

You will not move, you will not talk, you will not think unless they're thoughts about not moving.

Winston, I'm so sorry.

I ruined everything.

You would have been such a good cop.

You would have made someone really lucky to have you as a partner.

I always imagined I'd have a partner named Robertson.

That would have been perfect.

Yeah.

"Robertson, you're on the edge!

You've gone too far!"

No, no, no.

See, the thing about me and Robertson is that we're tight.

You know, then I went ahead and slept with his wife.

I don't know why...

Why would you do that?

I don't know why I would do that. The job really gets to you.

You know, it's stressful out there.

This might not be the right moment but... for what it's worth, I did it.

I kept a secret.

Well, congratulations, Nick.

You have the willpower of a six-year-old.

Oh, thank you.

I'm sorry about the whole kissing thing.

Oh, you don't have to apologize.

I did... kiss you back a little.

So, should we tell Paul together?

Oh.

Well, what do you think he's doing right now?

Do you think he's explaining to the air-brusher that that really is his name? Paul?

And that he wants that painted across the back of his denim jacket?

It's a normal name.

(whispering): Hey, Nick?

When I'm in prison, write, dance, sing... live your life.

And if you come and visit me in jail, please don't wear that robe.

It's a kimono.

Well, this is a first.

These are aquarium rocks.

So, that's the street name for...

No. These are actual aquarium rocks.

You were trying to flush rocks down your toilet.

Oh, what?!

Oh.

Oh, that's ridiculous.

That's great! Yes! Awesome!

So we're not going to prison?

(Cece laughing)

So, did Winston pass the background check?

Of course. He's one of our best cadets.

His test scores are high, he's passionate, hardworking.

He's gonna make one hell of a cop.

But he won't work in narcotics.

You get to be a cop!

Yay!

(all chatting happily)

Congrat... congrat... Congratulate...

Really? No, we're celebrating Winston.

Celebrating Winston. Okay.

All right, we'll celebrate Winston.

Oh.

Yeah.

Excuse me. Please consider moving.

I have no idea why you live with these people.

What kind of person would urinate on an electrical socket?

I... I thought it would make lightning.

I told you that wouldn't work, Nick.

Coach: Hey!

Guess who's here like he normally is every Saturday!

It's Duquan!

Big brother Wimstons.

Oh.

I love you, Mr. Wimstons.

I go from no hope to hope.

He take me and he says to me, "You're gonna be somebody. You- You could be the presidents, or Statues of Liberties."

Is that right?

We make homework togethers.

He buys me toys, and we chase each others, and we laugh at the sun.

This feels good, man.

Yeah.

Like I got a new friend.

Me, too.

Duquan.

Right.

Hanging out.

It's Jose, so...

Yeah, I like Duquan, though.

Yeah, but my name's Jose.

Like outlet malls?

I love outlet malls.

Ah, me, too, man.

Yeah.

Yeah. That's awesome.

On the weekend, though? Mm.

Yeah, but I mean, I have a strategy, you know.

Like, I start out with a smoothie, and then do my leg stores first.

Then, I... Yeah.

I do the same, but I end it with pretzel.

Pretzel. I...

Shut up.

Cinnamon pretzel?

Oh, my God.

Dude, don't, don't,.

No, you don't.

Don't.

No, you don't.

You want to play a tickle game?





(Phone rings)

Hello?

Hello, "Dog," it's Principal Foster.

Oh, hey. Did you just call me "Dog"?

You're Vice Principal now. We're peers.

Oh.

Good news... I have a replacement for your science class.

It's about time, you old son of a bitch.

What?!

Too casual?

Uh, what?

Hello?

Sorry, what? You're breaking up.

Hello?

Dog?

Hello? Sorry, hello?

(Staticky): I can't hear you.

Bad reception, sorry. Hold on.

(Staticky): Breaking up...

I'm so sorry. They're building a new building next door and I have terrible reception.

Hey, no more phone calls! Get out of my room!

It's the only place I can get a signal, dude...

You know that.

Out!

Look at the stick... Is it red or blue?

Uh, yeah...

Well, sir, I...

Get out of my room.

Hello? Hello? Hello  Hello? Hello... Stop.

Is it red or blue?

Hey, ow, Schmidt!

The Scarf has been backordered a month.

Wait, hello?

Meanwhile the hat is just sitting here.

Yeah, hello.

This is not a business center.

Hello?

Get out of my room.

Hello? Hello?

It's my man time.

Mama?

Mama, unplug it, okay?

Schmidt: Hello? Hello.

If you unplug it, it cannot electrocute you.

It's blue? Oh, yes!

Mr. Foster...

No, I don't want blue. With a bisque hat?

Hello, Dog. Dog?

I'll look insane!

Why do you have an electric guitar?

Aah!

Hello?

This phone situation has me really jazzed up!

Excuse my language.

Now, I'm gonna propose something.

Something insane.

Now you just all have to stay calm and trust me.

Fascinating.

Where do you put your music?

Why is there a rope?

(Phone rings)

(Gasps) It's ringing.

Whoa, that's cool.

Just like the movies.

We should answer it with, like, really funny voices.

Yeah.

We don't know who it is.

It could be anybody.

Could be Tanya from sixth grade.

Yeah.

(Stops ringing)

Oh... oh.

Next time it rings, we should answer it.

♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ Who's that girl? ♪
♪ It's Jess. ♪

Just can't stop looking at this thing.

Man, I used to be so great at talking on the phone, man.

You know, something about the cord and the handset that just really set me at ease.

You were weirdly smooth.

If you slow dance with Nick, I'll hold hands with Amy.

Just make sure she cut her fingernails, though.

Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.

I'm just being stupid.

Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.

It was going great, by the way.

If this isn't sexy, I don't know what the heck is.

Something just came over him.

He was amazing.

I'm just excited to add a third number:

Home, work and cell.

Damn, I'm reachable.

I'm definitely gonna mention that in my profile in Business, Man! Magazine.

Businessman Magazine?

No, no, no.

Check that out:  Business, Man! Magazine.

I've gotten a lot of heat from working on the sponge account.

I'm telling you, this is the first step in my quest to becoming a millionaire.

Well, I think that's a weird plan, but let's drink to it... Who's in?

No, come on, I got to study for my interview.

Oh, I would, man, but I got a lot of police stuff to study.

You know, like, roads, laws, b*ll*ts...

Be really nice if you guys spent some time and studied your friend Nick. Pop quiz, hotshots.

I miss you guys.

I don't understand what you're saying, man. Are you asking me a question?

For real, though, I miss you.

So we would just sit around and drink all day?

Aw, forget it, man! I'm storming off.

(Phone rings)

Oh!

Good morning, Vice Principal Day speaking.

What...? Calm down!

What?! Coach?!

(Whispering): Coach...

Are you sleeping with the school nurse?

Jess, are you crazy?

Of course I'm sleeping with the school nurse.

What?

Mazel tov.

My man. Much respect.

Look at you getting up in there.

Yeah. Living the dream.

Great.

That's really hot, dude.

That's really great. For me.

We have to fill out a form declaring our relationship?

Yes, it's a legal thing.

We're just covering our asses.

While you uncover yours.

Sorry, that was an unfortunate joke.

(Nervous laugh)

Um, anyway, uh, how did this start?

Uh, fine. A couple of weeks ago I got a cut.

Mm-hmm.

And I went to the nurse.

Okay.

And when I saw her, I was like, "damn."

And I was, like, "you frickin' got a cut."

And I was like, "you frickin' better fix it."

And she was like, "no. Cuts are gross."

Yeah.

And then we had sex.

Yeah.

That's disturbing on so many levels.

Um, I'm sorry, but your outfit looks like you got it at a Halloween store.

Thank you. Coach got it for me.

It's a child's medium.

(Giggles)

What'd you put for "nature of relationship"... "Girlfriend"?

Well, that's what I actually wanted to talk to you about.

'Cause, uh, we hadn't...

Question mark?

Um, it didn't feel like a question mark when you put a calamari on my finger like an engagement ring.

That didn't seem like a question mark to you?

Jess, someone's in my parking spot again.

Not now, Rose.

Hey, Ernie.

Hey.

Last night was really fun.

I found your swim trunks.

They're ruined. Really fun.

Ah, come on. Yeah?

I thought you ditched this bitch.

I will send your weave right back to the loom!

Oh, no, no. Excuse me?

Guys...

Oh, yeah!

Ladies, stop.

(Both arguing at once)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

See what you did?

This is a different form.

(Phone ringing)

(Groans)

All right.

(Ringing continues)

Settle down, I'm coming.

Hello?

No, Schmidt's not here.

No one's here. I'm here by myself.

Because I work at night, which means I'm probably the one who should answer the phone during the day.

Great, yeah, I'll tell him.

(Groans, sighs)

Great, she get a phone so Nick can answer it.

(Phone rings)

(Sighs)

(Groans)

What? I'm busy.

Winston's not here.

Really?

Uh-huh. Okay, I'll pass it on.

Okay, you too.

My gentlemen, I'm glad you're home.

I got your messages.

All right, here you go.

Wow. Are these alphabetized?

Yeah, you're welcome.

I felt like a secretary. It was pretty awesome.

Some auto body shop called, Schmidt... Apparently you're getting a spoiler?

I'm not getting a sp...

I just wanted a quote. Yeah, I get a quote just in case I do want to actually buy one.

And it's nice to have a price before you get emotionally invested. It's called predicting desires.

What I wish I would have said is when I first said it...

"Spoiler alert."

I wish it... when I... I wish I would have said, um,

"you're getting a spoiler.

Spoiler alert."

I don't think that would have helped.

I just... I'm just getting a quote, okay? It's really none of your business.

Definitely noted. Thanks, my man.

For the... Winston, uh...

Who's this Gal Judy?

I've never heard of her. She called twice.

Who is this woman?

(Chuckles) She's nobody.

Doesn't sound like nobody. Where'd you guys meet?

At the driving range.

The driving range?

But you don't golf.

Uh, I like to watch?

Winston, you go to the driving range just to watch?

Yeah.

Very strange, very strange.

Let's get back to this Judy character, because I am interested.

You made love to her yet?

I don't know.

Leave me alone, dude. Honestly, stop.

That's not even a big d... I don't even like her that much, all right?

Just, ugh. I'm probably gonna dump her.

Do you want to talk about it?

Just kidding. I'm messing with you.

Are you guys having as much fun as I'm having right now?

This landline has really brought us together in a great way.

I miss this.

Hey, if I cooked up a whole chicken, would you guys have some?

Those look like two hungry faces... (Chuckles)

Wow. That was intrusive.

Winston, how do you not know if you'd made love to someone?

I'm mad at you, Jess.

Why'd you put me on blast like that?

Because you shouldn't be sleeping with other teachers, Coach, let alone two.

Who are you, Blanche from Golden Girls?

Honestly, it took me a while to figure out who I was in that school, but I finally did.

Who?

I'm the guy who has sex with everyone.

Why can't you be the guy who loves recycling?!

Everyone loves that guy. This is a school.

It's a sexy place, Jess.

Look at that CPR poster. It's hot as crap.

What the...?

Why aren't they wearing shirts? Are they drinking wine?

Mm... That's it!

I'm gonna need to talk to all these teachers.

You're just jealous because you're not gettin' any.

(Indignant gasp)

When's the last time someone gave you CPR?

Well, I give it to myself at least once a month...

Oh!

To refresh.

I'm talking about real CPR!

Oh.

Look, you work in a school.

You need to have boundaries.

You have to be a professional.

Ah, Miss Day.

Oh.

There's someone here I'd like you to meet.

Oh!

This is Ryan.

He's gonna be taking over the science class.

Now, don't be alarmed, but his voice is gonna sound kind of funny.

It's because he's British.

Say something to her.

Hello. Pleased to meet you.

Ah. Oh, charming. Hi.

It's a... How do you do?

You must be, um... Mister...

"Gos... Gosin-Yure."

It's pronounced "Goes-In-You."

Goes-In-Who?

It "goes in you," Jess.

Goes in me. Goes in... Jess. What!?

I'm sorry, I'm gonna make a note of how to pronounce it.

It's really nice to meet you, Mr. Goes-In...

Ryan.

Coach: Hey, Jess, where you going? You forgot to tell him about boundaries!

It's great having you here, Mr. Goes-In-You.

Geauxinue. Yeah. Goes-In-You, Goes-In-You.

No... goes in all of us.

Yeah.

Sooner or later.

(Phone buzzes) This is Schmidt.

Hey, it's Nick. Let me get Winston.

Winnie the bish, you on?

What is happening right now?

I'm just giving you guys your midday update.

Schmidt, dry-cleaner company called.

Your socks are ready.

Schmidt: Oh, great.

Not quite sure why we need to be on a conference call for this.

Not quite sure why you need to dry-clean your socks, you weirdo, but we'll get back to that.

Winston, Judy called again.

And so, I told her you weren't feeling it.

(Laughs) Now why would you do that?

You said you were gonna dump her.

It was a very difficult conversation for you.

We all know how you are, so I just handled it. You're welcome.

Hey, Nick, do I need to be on for this? Can I get off?

Greta, great, great. You know what? Now she's gonna do something crazy.

You know, this is a very emotional woman we're dealing with, all right?

That bitch a leo!

Can I go now?

You should have thought of that before you dumped her.

I didn't! You did!

Because that's what you wanted.

I don't know what I want!

Judy didn't know what you wanted, either!

Oh, and Schmidt, the magazine called.

And they need a picture. But don't worry. I handled it.

What do you mean, you handled it?

I know you have a lot on your plate, so don't worry...

I sent them the most recent picture I had.

The most recent one?

Winston: Did Judy sound...?

Winston, enough! Nick, what, what do you mean by "the most recent"? I don't... I don't understand what that...

The latest picture.

It's the most accurate.

It's just good marketing. You know that. Check your e-mail.

You'll be happy.

Did you check it? Is it loaded?

Oh, no, no, no!

And that's all I got. You guys good?

(Schmidt sighs)

Okay, I'll check back in five.

What? Five... Five what? Nick? Five minutes?!

♪ I'm a very good secretary. ♪


(Phone buzzing) Hello.

Yeah.

Hello.

Yeah...

♪ Hello. ♪

Yo!

Hello.

Yo...

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

Yo!

What up? What up? What up?

Winston!

Hello.

I said... Winston I said "yo."

Wait. Who's this?

It's Schmidt! We got to do something about Nick.

We're here to address the school policies on interfaculty relations.

Some forms of touching, say, a... a friendly handshake, or a spirited pat, are completely appropriate.

Man: What if you spill coffee on your pants, and you're very burnt, and upon getting your pants cut off by paramedics, you become aroused?

I'm truly hoping that didn't happen.

What if you're in a situation where you either have to um...

Grab a teacher's crotch, or give narcotics to a student?

That's a great question, man.

Thanks, friend.

Not a great question.

And what if you...?

I'm done with you. If you feel things getting sexual...

Just say, "shut it down!"

Followed by a sweeping gesture with your hands, like such.

Everyone do it with me. Shut it down!

No, thanks.

It's kind of fun. Shut it down.

Shut it... Down.

Thank... Thank you, new guy.

Yes, Coach.

See, I'm more of a visual learner.

(Laughing): Oh, yeah, you are.

Do you think you could maybe demonstrate that move in context?

Really, Coach?

I think we'd all like that.

It's kind of like a...

Like a skit.

What?! (Overlapping chatter)

No idea.

Visual learning.

Like a skit.

All: Visual learning.

Show us! Do it!

All: Visual learning!

Okay, Coach, do you want to come up and help me?

How about the new guy?

British people love doing stuff, right?

No, I don't think...

British guy... doing stuff!

Woman: Yeah.

British guy doing stuff!

I'm telling you they don't like to do things.

Doing stuff! (All chanting)

The British are coming!

Okay, okay.

Happy to help.

(Applause and cheering)

Mr... "Guzinya" and I will now act out a sexual scenario.

It's "Goes-In-You."

Yeah. I know.

Okay, let's try it again.

All right, all right.

(Beep) Hello. You've reached the loft.

Oh, my God!

What?

Too sexy!

Sounds good to me.

Are you out of your mind?

I'm on f*re right now.

This is a home. We're not selling lubricant.

Why aren't one of you doing this?

Because we couldn't decide which of us to do it, and this way, it's fair.

Put nothing on it. Flat as can be.

All right, here we go. Flat as can be.

Just say the words.

(Beep)

(Flatly): Hello. You've reached the loft.

Oh, my God!

Will you not stop until the whole world is aroused?!

Cece: Okay.

Hey.

Nick, my man, looking good.

There he is.

New set of PJs?

I know what you're doing.

You're bl*wing hot air up in between my butt cheeks.

And I'm no idiot. I know I was let go 'cause of the dang old machine. Story as old as time.

A new piece of technology comes around, and all the peasants freak out.

But one prince knows what's going on, and he says:"Don't trust the technology!"

And all you peasants trust it, and then the machine becomes self-aware and destroys you all.

And then, I become the loneliest prince of all, laughing in my golden tower.

(Laughs)

Isn't that a movie?

Maybe I stole that from w*r games, yeah.

Short Circuit.

No, it isn't.

Man, you know what's a good movie? Splash.

I don't know what is happening.

(Phone ringing)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Let's see what she can do.

(Beep)

Cece (Flatly): Hello. You've reached the loft.

Schmidt: Oh, my God. Will you not stop until the whole world is aro...?

(Beep)

Woman: Hey, this message is for Nick.

You responded to my ad about a custom secretary headset.

Please give me a call back.

(Beep)

How do they know my name? It's a stinking old prank.

I don't even care.

I got a lot going on today, so...

Are you just eating a bowl of jelly?

What does it look like?

It looks like a bowl of jelly.

It's a bowl of jelly, yeah.

Okay, so say I'm in the library and I feel Mr. G.'S hands on my shoulders.

I'm not interested.

So what do I do?

I say, "shut it down."

Does that make things more clear for you?

I feel like it needs to be a little more real, you know what I mean?

I feel like if he were to touch her, that would help, am I right?

(Others agreeing)

Am I crazy for thinking that? No, right?

Yeah. Just...

It'll be more helpful if he were to touch her. Just touch her, man.

I don't think so.

Yeah, he should touch her. Touch her!

Get in there! Touch her.

Okay, fine. Um...

So I'm in the library and, uh, Ryan approaches...

Hello. You look tense.

(Oohing)

With that accent.

Oh!

(Everyone murmuring sensually)

Mmm...

Sha, na, na.

Mmm... Day-o.

A little lower. Right in the wolf patch.

(Puzzled murmuring) Huh? What?

Should I shut it down?

What? Yes. Yes!

Shut it down!

(All gasping)

I touched your... I... that was...

That's fine. It's-it's cool.

Nice to meet you, too. (Laughter)

That was an accident. And when an accident happens, shut it down.

(Cheering, laughter)

I did it again.

That's what I'm talking about!

I think we need to fill out some forms.

Why won't these messages play, Winston?

The machine's on the Fritz.

Just don't tell Nick.

The magazine was supposed to call today and set up my interview.

I'm as mad as a dad in traffic!

You probably burnt it out. I mean, you listened to Cece's message 100 times.

I know. Then I touched my peen.

(Scatting cheerily)

There he is.

All right, Nick, hey, uh, you were home today.

Did anybody leave any messages about my interview for tomorrow?

I don't know. Why don't you ask the machine? Isn't that what you wanted?

(Chuckles) Uh, the machine's not working.

Isn't that funny? I feel like I'm working perfectly.

I'm gonna go take this machine back to 1993 and exchange it.

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

The magazine. They called.

They left a message. They want to do the interview today.

Why didn't you say anything?

That thing is super important to him.

You know how much this interview meant to him.

Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah.

First you break up with Judy and now this?

Why are you so obsessed with answering the phone?

Man.

We're just peeling the onion all the way to the middle, aren't we?

What's going on?

Just because I miss you guys.

And I didn't know what was going on with your lives and now I do, and it-it made me feel connected to you.

I'm not gonna lie to you, man, that got me.

(Phone rings)

Hello? This is Nick.

No, I'm sorry. Schmidt isn't here.

No, he didn't... Pl... H... Can you hold on one second?

(Quietly): It's the magazine.

They want to cancel the interview.

What?

They want to do it right now or not at all.

Yeah, this is Nick again. No, he-he did... He might...

Hold on one second. I hear something. That might be him. Please hold.

(Quietly): You've got to talk to 'em.

Why do I have to talk?

Because even though you're the most awkward person I've ever met, you're magic on the phone and you know it.

You know, I put those days behind me...

Schmidt's right here. Hold one sec.

(Quietly): You have to do it. For Schmidt.

I need a soda, I need a straw and I need to get horizontal, so get out of my way.

(Grunts)

(Exhales deeply)

Yeah, this is Schmidt. What up?

I read. The last book I read. Good question, good question.

Uh, some biography with, uh, Carson Daly. The one with the red cover.

Yes, that Carson Daly Joint.

You know, I respect that dude.

Yeah, he's just like me. He's always on.

There's not a lot of good white role models out there, and I say that as a white man.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you got it, Business, Man!

Is that the magazine? What are you boobs do...

What are you. Winston, get off the phone.

Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

Shh!

Trust us.

What does marketing mean to Schmidt?

This was the spoiler. What did it say? Uh...

Predicting desires.

Predicting desires.

Well, to me, it's all about predicting desires and finding buyers, you feel me? (Chuckles)

He's really good on the phone.

Did you know that my name was an acronym?

Uh-huh. Schmidt: Some can have money, I desire thoughtfulness.

(Winston laughs)

Schmidt don't quit!

Hey, Coach.

Hey.

I just came in here to say I'm sorry.

Sometimes it's...

Hard to control your feelings.

Which I demonstrated by...

Grabbing a man's "Dujeels" in front of the entire faculty.

Well, I'm sorry for putting you in a position to grab that man's "Dujeels."

I don't like saying "Dujeels." It's weird.

I call mine my Sam Jackson 'cause he's in everything.

I just don't know how to face Ryan again. I was so unprofessional.

Jess, you're the Vice Principal, and you're a great Vice Principal.

Doesn't mean you're not a human being.

Thanks.

Oh... And you'll be happy to know I've repealed the policy.

Oh.

(Gasps) You have?

That's frickin' awesome.

Ruth.

Hi. It's hot under there.

Happy to know you two have patched things up.

Yeah, we have.

Oh, they've been patched.

(Both laughing)

Two times.

I see your hand moving, and I... Wish you'd wait till I left the room.

Ruth: My bad.

Hey. (Chuckles)

Hi.

Hi. Sorry. Um, my hands are...

Staying behind my back, don't worry.

I won't even look at it.

I mean, I-I looked at it just 'cause I said it, but I...

(Chuckles)

Uh... hmm, yeah.

I was gonna ask you...

Foster: Vice Principal? A moment, please?

I'm so sorry.

Don't be sorry.

Um, my boss.

Good seeing you.

I'll, uh, see you around.

I hope so.

Principal Foster, I am so sorry. I went overboard.

First off, it's "Dog."

Dog.

Secondly, do not apologize.

I have tried to corral these animals myself.

It's impossible.

Word.

These teachers are straight-up ho's, Dog.

Sometimes you just got to let people follow their urges.

Yes.

I completely agree.

It's too bad we can't.

We can't?

Absolutely not. We're administrators, B.

This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Two administrators? Perfectly fine.

But, unfortunately, as I've repeatedly told you, I'm not attracted to you.

Right.

You like asians.

So... Exactly.

So that's off the table.

Yeah.

So, do us both a favor...

Lock up that lobster.

(Sighs)

Schmidt:  I still can't believe it. Look at that. "Bringing nasty back."

Nick: "The bad boy of marketing."

That is cool.

So great for my brand.

I mean, I always knew I was a bad boy, but now it's in print and it's official.

Don't call yourself a bad boy.

Am I a bad boy?

You're not a bad boy.

Ooh-hoo-hoo, yeah. I like those boobies. Sweet little '70s boobies. Bra burning, feminist boobies.

(Laughter) Bouncin' around like they ain't go no sense.

You like 1970s cans? See, not me... I'm a 1950s guy.

Aah... Post-Korean w*r, pre-Vietnam w*r, My Nana has those.

Okay.

Check it out.

Holy cow.

Wow. Almost too big.

Way too big.

Those are intimidating, right?

Too small.

Gotta be able to palm a basketball, if you want to slam or jam or dunk it.

See, they're too straight for me, you know?

I like 'em going in two different directions.

Like-like cookie monster.

Oh, yeah, like his eyes.

Ooh. Now, see, my boobs got to go "ooh!"

(All chuckling) Yeah.

Oh, my God.

You guys are ruling women out based on their breast size?

It's the least important part of a woman's body.

Unless you're a baby. Are you guys babies?

We're not babies.

I'd like to think that... that you guys see value in women's bodies other than just the way they look.

Come on, Jess, you're really gonna tell me that you don't care what a guy looks like?

Well... I'll notice an attractive man.

I can go to the butcher and pick out a nice rump.

But I'm not gonna rule out a guy based on how he looks... that's shallow.

That's crazy.

Yeah, right. That explains...

So much.

What?

Okay, if you saw me in the bar and I was a stranger, would you rule me out based on my breast size?

Absolutely not. Your breasts are perfect.

Now, if I saw your wonky knee? (Chuckles)

That's a whole 'nother ballgame.

What w... Wonky knee?

You have a wonky knee?

You think I have a wonky knee?

The left knee's perfect.

Uh, but the right one's got some stuff.

Why?

Well, stuff.

Um... oh, why do you think I always let you take your own pants off before sex?

Because you're the laziest person I've ever met.

Wonky knee, huh? (Chuckles)

Like big bird?

(Sighs) I have a Sesame Street problem.

This is what's wrong with men in this country.

You all sit around all day and you read your p*rn magazines What's a p*rn magazine?

And you think that that's what women are supposed to look like.

Well, I have news for you, okay?

Real women are wonky.

Perhaps. But, like climate change, we pretend they don't exist.

(Snickering, laughing)

Right?

Do you guys all just think you're so perfect?

Yeah. Pretty close.

Ah, please.

I mean, you're an eight, you're an eight and a half.

Everybody knows I'm a sweet, sweet six.

Winston, for the last time. Stop rating us.

Jess, I know I'm not perfect, but if you're asking me if I judge, you know, women based off their breasts, then the answer is yes.

Everybody knows that boobs are a direct indicator of personality.

All right... What are you guys doing?

Yeah, how you walking on this thing?

That knee is not architecturally sound.

Coach: I don't trust it.

Man, if you had a jacket on with a bunch of yellow feathers, I'd be done!

I've had enough. This is... insulting.

Ugh. I'm so sorry, I know I don't know you, I know this is your booth, but, uh, my friends are really pissing me off.

I'm just gonna sit here for like... five minutes.

Or maybe ten.

15 to 20 at the most. Probably an hour.

They're super annoying to me.

(Chuckles): Okay.

(Laughs) Why are you mad at your friends?

They're so shallow. They're like...

They say that they have a boob shape preference, but when the chips are down, they'll take anything.

So would it be bad if I told you that I think you're hot?

Shut your gross, beautiful face.

No, I'd love it. Thank you.

Hi. I'm Matt.

I'm Jessica.

Pleasure to meet you.

Mm. Hey, you, uh, you want to maybe... go out some time?

Yes, I do. Yes.

Should I put my number in your phone or...

Yeah, that's... that works.

Great.

Works for me. But, you know, while-while we're on the subject of stupid physical stuff, you know, I should probably tell you before we go out, uh...

Mm-hmm?

I have a micropenis.

Cool. What?

It's a medical condition... it means I'm unusually small.

Technically, "micro."

Well... Lucky for you... My eyes are bigger than my stomach.

I don't know... what that means. but I'm free tomorrow night.

S04E04
Micro

Coach: It's an actual medical condition.

Here's a web page all about it.

I don't know what I'm looking at.

Where is the...

It's right there. I think. Yeah.

No.

It's like a single tent in a...

A vast, dark forest.

It's like the letter "I" floating around in a bowl of alphabet soup.

Oh, that's awesome... an anteater's being born.

Winston, it's a micropenis, bro.

That's a grown man?

Oh, my goodness.

Oh, my God.

Come on, guys, stop it.

This is exactly what I'm talking about.

Are you honestly going on a date with somebody who has one of these?

Yes, I am, 'cause I don't care what a guy's body looks like.

You know what revs me up?

A fertile mind and a gentle spirit.

A nice, smart guy...

How do you know he's nice? You barely know him.

Man made it through middle school with that ghoulish raisin. He's a hero.

I bet you're not gonna last a week with this guy.

I bet I last at least a month.

You want to put money down?

Oh, absolutely.

500 bucks.

All right.

Winston: Wow.

Great.

Wow.

You said yeah?

If I date him a month, then you will donate 500 bucks to the national organization for women's love your body campaign.

And if you win, I will get you a subscription to the p*rn site of your choosing.

Really?

Yeah.

(Speaking quietly)

Winston: Nubile Nubian Butts.

We know, dude.

Shut up, Winston.

We're gonna go with ass chat.

Ass chat? Come on, what is that... two butts talking to each other?

It's not butts talking to each other.

No, it's all a lot categories.

I'd like you to realize, someday, that a nice, sweet guy who just happens to have a lil' squeaker is just as attractive as a guy with a blue-ribbon hog that's ready for market.

Honey, if you have a blue-ribbon hog, you don't take it to the market, you breed that pig.

(Laughs)

'Cause what's he gonna do at the market?

Jess: Shut up, Nick.

You know what I mean?

Winston, honestly...

I'm sure the national organization of women will look forward to your donation.

Hey, boys, why don't you push heavy up?

Get 'em, heavy.

We got us a bet.

So now I was like screw it grandma.

I'm-a become a street artist, yo.

I mean, most people see a wall and they just see a wall.

I look at a wall and I see, like... a goat in a backpack.

Right.

Like, a ninja handing out cheeseburgers.

Whoa.

A chill alien, you know?

Well, who doesn't see a chill alien?

That's my question.

Lot of people.

Lot of people. It's sad.

You have any tattoos?

No.

I got seven.

Oh, good.

Check it.

Okay.

Custom font.

I invented that font.

Mm-hmm.

Star.

I have a question... do you know of a web site called "ass chat"

and do you know if it's socially conscious?

Just based off the name, I'd say, probably, yeah.

Hey! Okay, so you guys are kind of bringing the bar vibe down, and I need tips, so...

Pretend that you're having fun or pay for me to go to college.

You know, if I could give that poor man some of my penis, I would.

But, obviously, you don't pull a bumper off a Ferrari.

It did go fast, I'll give it that.

You know, when I look at that picture, I think to myself, "is there a God? And if-if there is, did he run out of Clay?"

Winston: I just put five dollars in the jukebox.

We got a Paula Cole rock block coming our way.

I'm just so thankful, you know?

Here we are, beautiful as all heck.

Normal to above-normal endowments.

That's right.

It's like why were we given so much while others were given so little?

I don't understand.

You know, I look at you and I see a stunning physical specimen.

It's like you were created in a la... in a lab. full of gay scientists.

Coach: You have a perfect body, my friend.

You're like the only Jewish Greek God... (Throaty "h"): Hercules.

Thanks, buddy.

You're cute as a button, bro.

Appreciate that.

You're swoll, my friend.

No, look, I work at it.

You're super swoll.

No, it's something I work at.

No, I mean that, though.

It doesn't happen overnight.

It's something that I put the work in, just like you do.

You look good, dude.

Schmidt: We're blessed, the two of us.

Coach: Beyond blessed. Just... I feel like we should be doing more to share our beauty with the world.

Right? It's frustrating.

It's fru... It's frustrating.

So frustrating.

Let me ask you something, guys, haveou er considered modeling?

Now, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.

That's crazy.

What? Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.

Modeling is a real job and, trust me, neither one of you could do it.

Schmidt: What? Give me a break, CeCe.

I could model in my sleep.

Modeling is exactly what these two should be doing.

I bet they would take some amazing pictures.

A drunk baby with a phone in its mouth couldn't take a bad picture of you two.

Oh, well... I mean...

I mean, I mean.

Nick.

Yeah.

Nick, um, uh, I need out of the bet.

Yeah. No, seriously, 'cause, um, he's coming out of the bathroom soon, and, um, he's actually... He's the worst.

So the date's not going well.

I know what you're thinking. It's not 'cause of the thing.

First of all, he's a street artist; Second of all... he called a scotch on the rocks a sko ro.

Ooh, that hurts.

I can't date him for a month... like, I can't even spend like, five minutes with him.

Right. I get it.

So you have to let me out of the bet, please.

You're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is, "he's too small."

No. It's not because of that. He has a... He has a tattoo that just says "Warrior Poet."

Sounds to me like you're being pretty shallow, Jess.

No. He tipped the waiter with a sketch of a hip-hop mouse.

He did? That's incredible.

Yes!

What's up, man?

Do you mind what's up, my man?

If I graffiti your bathroom?

I want to paint a skylight on the floor that looks into hell.

Oh... no, that's okay.

I'd prefer if you didn't.

Matt: Are you sure? Okay.

I'm positive. Yeah.

He's wearing skinny jeans.

They fit him like sweatpants.

Thinking of asking this lovely lady on a second date?

No diggity, no doubt. (Whoops)

We can go speaker shopping, drink some sko ros, if that's where the rhythm takes us...

Mm.

Um, unfortunately, I will be out of town for the next month.

Oh, for trues?

Yeah, for trues.

Hello. This drink is for you, from those gentlemen over there.

You the man.

Skol!

Do you know those bros?

Nope.

Anyway, I'm gonna be out of town for a month, but, uh, we can go out on another date, perhaps when I'm back.

Technically, our, um, one-month anniversary.

Jess, you're not going away for a month.

She keeps forgetting that that got canceled. You're available.

No, but you keep forgetting it was rescheduled.

You weren't on the e-mail.

Okay. That doesn't sound for trues.

For true.

You're not really going out of town, are you?

Oh, gosh. Uh, Matt... (Sighs)

If I'm being honest, I don't think we should go on a second date.

I get it.

Yeah.

It's because of my micropenis.

No!

I looked it up and I-I actually feel like I could make that work. Um...

No, it's...

Don't take this the wrong way, but...

It's actually your personality and everything about you.

You think I'm a douche bag.

You said that you thought street art was the closest thing to an education homeless people would ever get.

Okay.

And I when I asked you, "is that a joke?" You said...

Your mom is a joke.

Yeah. You said, "your mom is a joke."

Right? That's kind of a douchey response.

I'm really sorry.

I mean, I've been made fun of my entire life... in school, in locker rooms... so, yeah, I can be a douche bag sometimes.

But I'm this way... because of my micropenis.

Later.

Radiant. You don't even need Yes, yes. this bounce board. You're making your own light, man.

No doubt, no doubt.

Winston, you getting this?

Oh, hell, yeah, dude. I'm getting all of this.

Flawless.

Yeah, there you go. All right.

Now give me some stuff like it's the first day of school, right?

Okay.

That's right, and you got your backpack on. Yeah, there you go.

But you packed your own lunch. But what you don't know is when you were making it, you got some mustard on your forehead.

That's right.

Now you're playing pictionary, okay?

Now you're playing pictionary, and what do you...

Ooh, now I got... Now I got my little card.

What am I gonna draw? What am I gonna draw?

You get sardines.

They don't smell good.

How do I draw a smell? How do I draw a smell? 

What does that look like?

That's modeling. That's right.

Wow, this is great.

Hey, give me five. I got to protein-load.

Schmidt: What do you see we split that last packet of power goo.

I cannot believe that this actually worked.

Oh, man...

No, that's a lie...

I would've been surprised if it didn't.

A classic CeCe-Winston mess around.

That's not a thing.

All right.

So, guys, I was looking at the sh*ts here, and they're really incredible.

I think I could call my modeling agent, if you want.

I know this... we're-we're, like, just doing this for fun and everything, but part of me wants that to happen more than anything else in the whole wide world.

Ugh! No, but my agent probably would only want one of you, and you guys are a team, so I shouldn't call.

Hold on. (Chuckles) You don't want to be rude to the man.

No, no, no, no, no. We don't want to see you guys pitted against each other.

Mm-mm.

P-pitted against each other?

Pit...? What are you talking about?

I think, you know...

I'm more runway.

He's more...

Yeah, I feel like I'm more catalog, high fashion.

Catalog, back of the mag.

You're t... you're too big for high fashion.

Also, my agent really loves piggyback sh*ts, so...

We should piggyback.

We'll piggyback right now.

Oh.

Yeah.

Let me get on, man.

You get on me.

I didn't know you guys had it in you.

I want to be on the bottom.

Let me be on the bottom.

Yeah, yeah, you're a little piggy.

Bottom's my game, dude.

No, me...

You went to the market. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Little piggy went to the market. (Laughs)

Just let me... (Groans)

Damn it. No.

Oh, yeah.

It's like sh**ting candy into a baby.

Mm...

That's it. That's it.

Yeah, give me that. Give me that!

I could... I could...

I can totally dig this.


Hey, Jess.

Hey.

I know you're bummed and so I hate to do this, but I want to look at p*rn and you owe me a year's worth.

Yeah, okay. You know what?

You earned this p*rn.

And the vip pass.

And the "Kitty Room live cam experience."

Do you really need all of this?

Just click the boxes.

Matt was right. I am shallow.

It's like I jumped to a conclusion about him, but I didn't have the whole story.

I thought I was better than you guys. Mm...

But I'm a superficial size queen.

Coach: Hey, guys?

Can you tell schmidt that my portfolio is way better than his portfolio?

Look at that: I'm better wet, I'm better dry, my sexy baby is way more believable than his.

Watch, look... mama change baby 'cause baby made a dirty...

Schmidt: Okay, mine is way more sexy.

There are people lining up in the streets to have sex with my baby.

Liar!

I don't like this.

You can't use that photo, unless you're planning on posing for the tiny nipples of America foundation.

Schmidt: Yeah, you're one to talk, little miss princess waist!

Hey, I'm a 26! That's normal!

Yeah, in Asia.

Who's talking to you, depression-era garbage man?

I've been holding that in for two years.

I said one thing.

Guys, stop attacking each other!

Come on. He's making fun of you

'cause he feels sensitive about his geisha waist.

And you're putting him down

'cause you've got those cute little kitten teats.

Everybody has something.

She's right, you know. She's right.

Look, I grew up fat, and I have scars that you can't see.

And I'm not talking about the stretch marks that I had removed by laser beams.

Mm.

No matter how many miles I run, I'll never outrun that feeling.

Damn, son.

I didn't even know it was like that.

It'll always be like that, my man.

Still better than having a micro penis.

So much better.

Yeah.

It's true.

Guys!

We're all covered in micro penises.

No, I'm not.

Coach: Come again?

No, thank you.

I don't want to be covered in anything.

No, it's not true.

Yes! Yes! No! We all have flaws!

We're all freaks!

All of us.

We have to support each other!

I knew it!

I am better than you guys.

Thank you for helping me realize that.

I know now why I was superficial.

It's because I was scared.

Of my micro...

No. No!

Of mine.

What?!

I'm saying that we should all celebrate our flaws! Together!

I'm saying that...

The one day I wear jeans.

(Groans)

I'm saying, look. We're exactly the same.

I'm sorry, what-what am I looking at?

This monstrosity the doctors call a knee that I didn't know was a problem till, like, three days ago.

What the hell is this?!

You have a girlfriend?

He did!

Whoa, whoa... How can... no, no, no!

Matt: How dare you!

That's w*r question mark!

How dare you don't answer me!

Think I should go.

You owe me $12,000! (Door slams)

Wait, wait... Jess, I can explain.

Okay, why are you not running after your girlfriend right now?

Aah, if I'm being totally honest, she was getting a little fat.

No, she was... that's crazy!

I wouldn't behave like this if someone, just once...

(Voice breaking): Just once, took the time to get to know...

You're not even crying!

You are unbelievable!

Is anything about you real? Anything? Do you even have a micro penis, or is that...?

It... it... looks like a... little tiny... pigeon's egg.

Don't you want to hatch the bird?

No, I definitely, definitely do not.

You're... you're a very complicated person.

Um...

But I'm glad I met you.

Sort of.

I mean, I don't know why, but... I kind of am.

Anyway, take care of that little rug-rat.

He needs you.

Hey, man.

Oh, hey. I'm just, uh...

It's all right.

I'm just, I'm just looking over some of the pics from today.

I don't know which one to send to the agent.

I've narrowed it down to 60.

I can take a look at 'em.

Yeah, okay.

Just tell me what you think about a couple of these.

I just, I don't know what's what at this point.

This "hot guy with a kidnapped son..."

Wow.

He really looks like he's never gonna find his son.

"Classical guitarist loses a shoe."

That guy's never gonna find his shoe.

I don't know.

This is "cuddles with tigers."

Oh-ho.

It's good.

This is "how did I get up here?"

What do you think about this one?

"Kiss the cook."

See, I like "kiss the cook."

It's catalogue.

His lips are popping.

There's an accessibility with this one that I feel like...

Schmidt, relax. I'm bowing out.

I want you to have this.

Come on. What?!

Why are you doing that, coach?

Because you obviously need this more than I do.

When you look in the mirror, you see a fat kid.

I don't. I don't know how that feels.

I do. It's my micro-p, yo.

If there's anything that could finally help you get over your body image issues, it's modeling.

That's for sure.

Yeah.

'Cause you're not a fat kid anymore, man.

You are a model.

Now, say it.

I don't know.

Say, "I'm a model."

I'm a model.

Say it louder.

It doesn't feel real.

I need to hear you say it, or else I'm not gonna believe it, man.

I'm just saying, it's hard... I'm a model.

That's better.

Hold on.

I'm a model.

Good.

I'm a male model...

You are a male model.

I'm a male model!

What is happening?

What did we do?

I don't know.

(Whoops, laughs)

Thanks, coach.

Mm.

Now, go journal.

I'm gonna go journal.

Right on, man.

Mm.

Coach: Um... What's going on with you two?

Hey.

What?! Nothing.

Man, we just being mega-cool over here.

Mm-hmm.

What is going on, guys?!

Wait. Hold...

Hold on.

Was all this a classic CeCe and Winston mess-around?!

No!

Yes. Yeah.

Do not acknowledge that is a thing.

It's not a thing.

Now, look, okay, look, we got a little carried away, but how are we supposed to know he was gonna get emotionally invested?

This will destroy him. You know that, right?

You two got to make him a model.

I did not mean to hurt Schmidt, okay?

But I can't make him into a model!

Not in modern-day America.

In 1970s Israel... Mm-hmm.

Maybe.

Get... it... done.

I hate when Schmidt cries.

Sounds like a ghost singing "hey ya!"

♪ Hey ya ♪
♪ Hey ya, oh, oh-oh ♪
♪ I want to be your daddy... ♪

Fix it!

It's glorious, isn't it?

How did this happen?

Are there just no laws in koreatown?

Uh, well, uh, CeCe's agent saw Schmidt's portfolio and loved it.

Yeah, yeah, he, uh... he fast-tracked it.

That-that's an industry term.

So, what am I selling here anyway?

Oh, uh, you know, uh, Korean-Jewish interrelations.

All right.

I wanted to tell you that, um, the bank cancelled my credit card after I ordered you p*rn.

That's okay, I wanted to cancel it anyway.

You paying for it kind of k*lled it for me.

Yeah.

Just made me sad for everybody involved.

I wanted to give those girls a hug and say, "wipe your face, go back to school, honey."

Coach: So, guys, when does Schmidt get paid for this?

Well... The agency is pretty tapped Uh-huh. after spending $1,887 on this billboard.

Well, why don't the Jew-Koreans pay for it?

Well, it's an international thing.

See? So, there's fees.

Coach: Yeah, but you said he would get a check for $500.

Yes.

Congrats, bro.

You deserve that $500.

Let's head out.

I think I'm gonna stay here for a little bit, take this all in.

All right.

Tell me more about this internet p*rn. Is there anything I would like?

Like something with a story, you know?

I don't think you'd like it.

Nothing about Victorian England or anything like that?

Oh, there's some stuff, I don't think you would like it.

Millionaire!





Hey, Nick?

(whispers) Shh, I'm reading.

Can you just give me a second?

What do you want this time?!

So, I'm... I'm pitching on the sponge account today.

It's kind of a... it's kind of a big deal.

I'm just wondering why my idea notebook is covered in crimson stains.

Oh, that's a fair question.

It's either Sloppy Joes, or it's blood.

(groans)

You unbelievable pig person!

You giant, fat pig person! You sloth.

You should be living in a tree in Costa Rica, you know that?

Hi, guys. Um, have either of you seen the French press?

The French press is in cupboard 64B. Did you not consult your item map?

No, I looked there. The Tagine's in 64B.

What is the Tagine doing in 64 frickin' B?!

I used the French press.

Everybody chill out. So it's in here somewhere.

Nick, you know you're not allowed to use the French press.

I use it to get the pulp out of my juice.

So just give me one second, I'll find it.

(chuckles): Hold on. Oh, yeah.

I wasn't looking for it, but I found my pulp bowl.

That is a crystal candy bowl filled with orange goop.

I don't need to sit here and take this! I'm going to my study.

You are gonna get back here and clean your room, mister!

JESS: Guys, I still need the French press.

Winston, I need my study corner!

No, not after last time.

Hey, Winnie! You know there's an Albany in California?

(chuckles): Well, hello, Winston Bishop.

I towel-b*rned my unders.

Well, I just prairie-dogged thanks to you guys.

Stop fighting! Now the bathroom stinks for no reason.

You happy, Schmidt? You just scared Coach's poop!

No, I'm not happy. I'm poor, and I'm living in a filthy thimble.

I've gone from riches to rags. It's reverse Annie.

Oh, spoiler alert. Now you just ruined Annie.

(men arguing)

JESS: Guys, chill out!

Schmidt, your people have been selling sponges since the days of Abraham. You got this.

Nick, the pulp bowl is real gross. Tighten up.

Most importantly, my dad is coming with his new girlfriend, and I need the French press.

Oh, 64B. The Tagine is in 64B.

64B is occupied!

Uh, he said the Tagine is in 64B.

It stinks in there! What did you do?!

You k*ll an animal?!

How long before you unleash holy hell on your dad's new girlfriend?

I want to make sure I got a good seat and plenty of snacks.

Okay, Cecilia, look, I know I've been a little bit hard on my dad's girlfriends in the past...

I know you stole my dad's credit card, Margot.

h*t the damn road.

I don't have a car.

(whispers): Find one.

I was the one who had to pick up the pieces when his heart got broken.

Besides, to hear my dad talk, it sounds like he has really found someone who... is good for him.

Ha!

And you believe that?

Your dad has terrible taste in women.

That's why I love him so much.

Remember the one who pretended to be a paraplegic?

Get up!

I can't!

Oh, whatever.

That's the last one I met, and I'm lucky he's letting me meet this one.

So, what? You're just gonna be nice to her? No fireworks? No show?

I'm gonna be nice to her no matter who she is.

Then what the hell am I doing here?

(knocking)

Oh.

Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi.

Hi, Daddy.

Gee, I'm sorry we're late, you know, but we saw Seal at the airport.

We talked to him for 20 minutes, got his autograph.

Wasn't him.

No.

Anyway, this is Ashley.

Hi.

I think, um, we went to high school... together.

You went to high school together!

We went to high school together!

Julie Berkman's older sister Ashley?

That's me.

(Cece laughs)

Is this fun or what? (laughs)

(whispering): Oh, my God!

(whispering): Your dad is dating Trashley Berkman?

Didn't she... ?

Yes. She sexually intercoursed my high school boyfriend George Jiang underneath the bleachers.

While you were sitting...

Yes! While I was sitting on those bleachers.

Have you ever seen sex from above, Cece?

It's horrible. That's why God thinks it's a sin.

Also, Trashley gave him giardia in his belly ring.

Giardia is a river disease.

She had river mouth.

Wasn't George Jiang, like, six-11?

Yeah. They called him George Jiang the Giardia Giant, and I never got to hold him in my arms.

What are you gonna do?!

Uh...

Uh... nothing.

I'm gonna be sweet and kind and supportive.

Look, peop-peop... people change.

People change. It's been 15 years.

She had sex with our DARE officer!

No way.

There were rumors flying around about every damn one.

(chuckles)

You remember the rumor about me? What?

Oh, that you shaved your chin?

Was that was the rumor about me?

That was the rumor.

No. It was... definitely sexier than that.

Thank you guys for coming. It's really helpful that you're here.

I'm trying to get my boss to give me the new account.

I just have to figure out how to sell sponges to men.

What do I have? I have a blood-stained idea notebook filled with terrible ideas.

I don't know what to do, you guys.

Damn it!

"Spongey make wipey." I like that.

Okay, please. I don't have a lot of time.

This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna say the word "sponge", and you guys are gonna say the first word that pops into your head, okay? Ready, one, two, three. Sponge.

Sponge!

Yellow.

Sponge.

That was mine.

Okay, let's just try this. We're gonna try this one more time.

Okay? Just clear your head, okay?

So I'm gonna say the word, and you're gonna say the first word that pops in your head.

Okay, it might be "sponge." Don't say "sponge."

Sponge!

Sponge.

Damn it! Focus!

I'm sorry. Okay, let's just try it again.

Give me a sh*t. Give me a sh*t. Give me a sh*t.

I'm gonna say "sponge" one more time, first word that pops into your head. Ready? One, two, three, sponge.

Sponge. Aah!

Winston!

Sorry. So much pressure, man.

Okay, you know what? Let's move on to Coach.

Coach, here we go. You're the man of the group.

You should be good at this. We're selling sponges to men.

Ready, one, two, three, sponge.

Sponge.

Why would you say that?

Okay, okay, okay.

Okay, come on, come on. Sponge.

Cake.

What?

Cake. No!

Sponge cake.

We all know that men are idiots.

How long have you been in my office?

But what we don't know is how much they love to clean.

You're wasting my time, Schmidt. Go.

Come on, Gina, you have to give me this account.

They want to market sponges to men. I'm the only man in the office.

Oh, speaking of. Sherri, you got the sponge account!

Touchdown! Yeah.

Just hear me out here.

The reason why men don't talk about how much they love to clean is because they're afraid to admit it.

Give me a chance here. Be the one to put Schmidt on the map.

Let's blast America right in the face with a little bit of Schmidt.

Oh! God in heaven! Fine!

Put together a focus group, okay?

I will do that. This is exciting.

All right. Maybe next week we'll start it?

No. Today, 3:00.

Today... today at 3:00?

Today at 3:00?

Mm-hmm.

3:00 today... that sounds great.

I love that idea.

Mm-hmm, you just... you just earned a special thank you in my autobiography.

Working title: Punting the Sweet Fantastic.

I feel like you kind of have to do something to write a book about yourself.

Sports!

(screams)

Oh, it's just so great to see you guys again.

Will you please remind me?

Were you there my first senior year or my second?

I was not good at high school.

(Bob and Ashley laugh)

Oh, the early 2000s.

God, I did so much E.

Just doing E, watching that show Ed.

I would love to know how you two lovers met.

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, sure.

Okay, so I was listening to him sing with his band, The Co-Pays.

Yeah, well...

I didn't know you were in a band, Dad.

Yeah, just... just me and a few other pharmacists.

You know, we do alt rock covers.

Oh, man, when he started singing "She's So High"...

♪ She's so high... ♪

Stop. Because I'm gonna fall in love again.

Okay, go, I want to.

♪ She's so high... ♪

ASHLEY (sighs): Oh.

Oh, man. That was it. I was done.

Ashley, have you kept in touch with our DARE officer?

Oh! Cece.

Oh. Okay, I... I get it.

You guys heard about that rumor that I had sex with the DARE officer?

No! Only a crazy person...

That rumor was true.

(stammers)

Crazy fun person.

Oh, yeah, that guy.

Wow, I did not just say no. I said yes.

Oh, yeah.

I just said, "Yes, yes, yes."

Oh, she said yes a lot.

(laughs) She's had sex with hundreds of guys.

Yeah. You know, we spent some time trying to total them all up.

It was fun.

k*lled a whole Saturday. Yeah.

We couldn't even get through the list.

We got to the "Ls."

(laughs)

But that was in the past.

And then I was diagnosed with a sex addiction.

Oh, great.

Thankfully, I attended rehab.

Which... did not take the first time.

Or the second.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

But third time's the charm.

For a lot of people. Not for me.

For me, it took four. Four times.

Well, Bobby, we should get ready to go to the beach.

Okay.

Yeah.

Thank you so much for this delicious brunch, Jess.

It was wonderful.

I ate so much, I'm gonna have to bang nine guys just to work it off. (laughs)

Oh, my goodness.

(Bob laughs)

I'm kidding. I did do that once, but I'm not gonna do it this time.

It's all in the past for me.

Isn't she great?

I just love her.

She makes me laugh so much.

(groaning)

What? What... what, are you humming?

Mm... Dad, just so we have this conversation...

No, no, Jess.

She seems like the type of girl who might hurt you.

Jessica...

I've seen you get hurt by a lot less.

Please, don't... don't go there.

No matter what you say, you're not gonna change my mind.

I'm in love with her, and I'm gonna marry her.

Gonna... get a new mom, Jess.

BOB: ♪  She's so high... ♪

Hey, are you okay? Because I am not sure if you heard that, but there is going to be a wedding.

Oh... there will be no wedding.

And it begins.

Why are we meeting in a parking garage?

Because what we are doing is unsavory and we're hiding from God.

And you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...

Yeah, you definitely did.

Yes, there'll be pizza.

Just do one thing for me first.

Here, memorize these.

That's yours. That's yours.

"I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand."

Look, I had to scramble, you guys.

I told my bosses how much men love to clean.

What are talking about?

Only you.

Yeah, only...

Yeah. I know!

Why do you think I'm rigging this focus group?

"Sponges make me feel more exhilarated than any home run or touchdown ever could."

This is ridiculous, man. I'm out!

I can buy my own pizza.

Can somebody please loan me $15?

Maybe like 20, 25, depending on toppings, 'cause I'd love to get a bunch of ham.

Ham. What about the tip, dude?

What about tip?

I don't give tips. It's for delivery. You don't tip delivery people, ever.

You definitely tip delivery people, but...

Guys. Guys.

I get sponges, this solves all our problems. Okay?

I make more money, Nick gets his room back, I get my life back on track.

Punting the Sweet Fantastic.

For the last time, Schmidt, that doesn't mean anything!

Fine. But I'm gonna need one hour in a quiet room to get into character.

No.

Right on.

After long and thoughtful and careful consideration, Winston is in.

Okay.

Assuming pizza is still on the table.

Say "pizza" one more time, Winston.

No, just don't.

Just don't.

No, we just never talked about when we're gonna...

Don't.

Just don't bring it up. He's getting really mad.

Like, delivery of... Say "pizza."

Say "pizza" one more time.

Don't say it again.

Say "pizza" again.

Pizza.

Say "pizza" one more time, I'm gonna k... k*ll you!

I just thought maybe we'd talk about toppings, perhaps, or something.

Not a mirror.

Not a mirror, you idiot.

Not a mirror.

Sponges make me feel exhilarated more than any...

Did you just say "sponges make me feel exhilarated"?

(chuckles): No, no. I... I..

What do you think of sponges?

They're stupid.

That's how I feel. (laughs)

I mean, who cares?

Ex... That's exactly how I feel.

What do you think of this whole place?

I'd rather not be here.

"Be here" is what I was about to say.

(both laughs)


I'm Nick.

I'm Brittany.

Oh, my God, we have so much in common.

Okay.

My dad can't marry her.

He gets hurt in relationships with normal women.

Yeah. He can't handle a recovering sex addict.

No.

What if she relapses?

It would crush him. It would crush his heart.

I can't let this happen. I have to protect him.

So what are you gonna do?

I could write him a letter about my feelings.

We... Yeah, but her phone is in her purse, and we could check her phone for dirt on her.

But he hates letters.

He always gets so frustrated opening the envelope.

You know you want to check her phone. You know you want to.

Cece, we're adults; we're gonna handle this like adults.

We're not snooping.

You're right, you're right.

That is... that's a huge violation of privacy; you can't do that.

Put that... What does it say?

It's bad. Mm.

Give that to me.

(gasps)

Dad, she's cheating on you!

What?

Yeah, just ask Jim.

At 10:40, Jim heard she was in town.

At 11:52, Jim had his hands down his pants.

And at 11:53...

Cumin? What, is he cooking cumin?

(clears throat)

Oh, my God.

My dad is the best guy in the world, and you better h*t the damn road, unless you want to say hello to my old friends Crabtree and Evelyn.

That's my work phone. I'm a sex therapist.

Jim is my client.

Your... your client?

Client!

Client.

Client.

Client.

Am I supposed to say "client" now?

I'm gonna go. This was clearly a mistake.

No.

And for the record,

George Jiang gave me giardia.

I saved you from a hideous river disease.

Thank you.

Damn it. She won't answer any of my calls.

I left ten voice mails.

Two of them, I'm screaming. Three, I'm crying.

One is a long silent one. Nothing!

And it's all your fault... both of you guys.

But mostly you.

Look, Dad, I'm so sorry.

Is there anything I can do...

There's nothing more that you can do.

I... I knew this was a mistake bringing her here.

Wait, Dad.

(door slams)

SCHMIDT: So, uh, why don't you tell me what you think about that sponge there, Coach.

I mean... (clears throat) Ernie.

I don't know why I would call you Coach.

Okay. Um... (clears throat)

Well, I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.

Wow, thank you so much for that.

I wish my buddies could see me now.

What?

They'd be all like, "Hey, man, let me get a h*t of that squishy whip."

Right on. Way to, uh, add your own take.

Uh, to-to your... to your own take.

WINSTON: You know, I... I have something I'd like to add.

Please.

Um, I like cleaning.

You like cleaning.

It is the only thing I can control in a world filled with chaos.

Thank you.

May I add, I am Thor, and this is my hammer, Mjolnir.

M... Melnir. Mjolnir.

Okay, wonderful detail. Thank you so much for that.

Uh, how about you down there, Mayor of the Corner?

(chuckles)

(pounds table) Nick.

What?

How does cleaning make you feel?

Uh, like I-I'm cleaning. Move on to somebody else, please.

(quietly): Read the cards that I gave you. Remember the cards?

Not now.

(pounds table) Read your cards!

You want to know what I think about your sponges?!

(imitates farting)

(laughs)

(laughs)

Well, this is clearly rigged.

My office. Now, Schmidt.

Schmidt...

Schmidt, I'm sorry.

(door closes)

Dad.

Thanks for waiting.

I wasn't waiting. I just can't get this damn thing started.

You're just pressing buttons.

This was supposed to be a big weekend for me and Ashley.

I had everything planned.

I... I even wrote new lyrics to our... our song.

(high-pitched): ♪ Ashley, marry me... ♪

(engine starts)

Y... you didn't have to do that, you know.

I can take care of myself.

Can you? Dad, if I hadn't protected you after you and Mom's divorce, you would've ended up with Nancy Zimmerman.

Oh, Nancy Zimmerman.

She was bad news, Dad.

Ooh, v... very bad. You don't know the half of it.

That woman made me try cocaine in 2005.

What, Dad?! Booger sugar?

Yes.

Nicaraguan yazz.

Are you kidding me?

It was a very expensive evening.

I wound up buying his and her Jet Skis.

The point is I'm still standing, and I can take care of myself.

Yes, I might get hurt, but that'll be my problem.

You don't need to do it anymore, Jess.

I should be taking care of you.

Ashley is different from any woman I've ever dated.

She... she makes every day better.

I... I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

Aw, Dad, that's so sweet.

(car alarm chirps)

Hey!

Hey, Th... Ashley!

JESS: What did she do? She went out and found a guy?

She's gonna relapse. Um...

Oh, we have to turn her off. Ashley...

Let's turn on NPR and blare it.

Oh...

Ashley, wait. Wait a minute. Please. Please don't do this. Please.

JESS: Ashley, if you're gonna relapse, relapse with my dad.

I'm not relapsing.

This is Roy. He's my L.A. sponsor.

BOB: This is Roy? Oh!

You know, I... I always wanted to meet you. Hi.

Jess, he's not a strange man.

He's a sex addict.

Former sex addict. Uh, current chocoholic.

I'd be in trouble if you were black.

Thank you?

Ashley, look, I screwed up.

I have to let my dad make mistakes.

Oh, I'm a mistake?

No, you are not a mistake.

That came out wrong.

I'm sorry, Bob.

I never meant to come between you and your daughter.

I love you so damn much.

You're my big, round, bald, fuzzy Weeble-Wobble.

But I just... I just need a little space.

It's not over, Dad.

Get the ring.

I'm sorry, Schmidt. What can I say?

You're just not really built to play with the big girls.

Don't f*re him!

Oh, God.

What the... Why?

Give him the account.

He's a hard worker, and he's a neat freak.

How do I know that? 'Cause I share a room with him.

You two share a room?

And you should see his side.

It is so clean. It looks like the inside of a Japanese subway.

Speaking of sharing a bedroom, Brittany's coming over tonight.

Uh, so I'm gonna need ten to 15 minutes of privacy for...

I don't need 15 minutes. That's excessive.

Give me five to ten.

That feels braggy. Give me three to five, but no less than three 'cause that's rude to girls.

Do you really think that she's gonna have sex with you in that pulp-covered filth bunker? - I'll throw a tarp down.

Oh, God.

SCHMIDT: What if she's turned off by the mess? What if she's turned off by...

What if she's turned off by the mess?

Hey, Gina, why don't you hear me out here for a second.

That's all right.

If Nick cleans his room before Brittany comes over, he might get laid.

I don't know. It seems like a lot of work.

Not with the right tool.

We open up on a modern man with a nose that only America could love.

This might seem obvious, but what side does the dirty stuff go on?

He doesn't know a lot, but he's about to discover the ultimate wingman.

NICK: I bet this side is really good for tough areas.

The Man Sponge.

Because the dirtiest thing in your room...

Probably be her. (chuckles)

Yay. We're doing a pitch.

Yeah. (chuckles)

I... can't believe I'm saying this, but I like it.

All right, you get the sponge account, Schmidt.

Sponges. We got sponges.

We got sponges. We got sponges. We got sponges.

JESS: Wait!

Ashley! My dad loves you!

No matter what! Wait!

I don't know.

I mean, are you okay?

You need to do it now, Dad, before we get flattened by a parade. Come on.

Ashley... will you marry me?

And be the stepmom to a very crazy but... but very lovable woman?

(chuckles): Yes.

Yes. Yes!

Oh, yes!

Jess, you're my little girl now.

Oh, Jess.

You go to your room. (laughs): I'm just kidding.

I'm kidding. But you should go to a-a hospital.

Here's to attending a wedding with everyone from high school and my dad's side of the family.

It's gonna be great. It's like going to prom with all my dad's friends.

NICK: Hear, hear!

(cheering)

Oh. Oh.

No, no, no, no.

Don't worry, don't worry.

I got it. I got it. I'll just clean it.

COACH: Dude, there's a sponge in your hand.

SCHMIDT: No, let him go.

He's my inspiration. You know, living with him in that slovenly hellhole has been a secret blessing.

It's made me stronger.

Without ash to rise from, the phoenix would just be a bird getting up.

I am a phoenix, and I will rise.

He usually says that speech before sex.

By 2015, I will have my own room. And by 2016...

COACH: What is he looking at?

I don't know.

... I will be a millionaire.

Spongey make wipey.

ANNOUNCER: The Man Sponge.

Because the dirtiest thing in your room... 

Should be me.

Sponge. Sponge. Sponge. Sponge. Sponge. Sponge. Sponge. Sponge.





Hey, look who it is! It's Schmidt. And...

This is Barb. Barb is leaving.

Oh, Barb. Like the elephant.

That's Babar, you dum-dum.

Barbara. A little potassium pick-me-up?

Since I know sleeping wasn't the main activity of the night.

Thin walls. Just kidding. They're very thick.

You're just so loud! (chuckles)

You have a lot of roommates.

So many of 'em. That's great.

Bye, Barb.

Bye, Barb.

Bye, Schmidt.

(door shuts)

That was the third piece of nanny this week, am I right?

Sure is.

Little shop talk from someone who's also out there trying to crush butt herself.

Um, where are you meeting all these eligible singles, these, uh, elly-sings?

Dice.

Hmm?

It's kind of like Tinder. Dice and Tinder.

I've been to those bars. They're downtown, right?

(groans)

Dice is a dating app.

Dating app. What?

It's not for you.

Schmidty.

Come on. I've Internet dated before.

You send an e-mail, you get excited, you wait, you get an e-mail back.

You are just describing e-mailing.

Come on.

You're gonna get eaten alive on Dice.

Do you want to see...

Come on, now.

Do you want to see... This is Dice. Come here.

It's all about split-second decisions, okay?

You see a picture, you swipe down for yes, you swipe up for no.

JESS: You're so fast.

Instinct. That's what it's about.

Which you don't have.

Now, I'm gonna go do a deep-ass mouthwash.

Don't go on Dice, Jess.

I won't.

Okay, now.

New account.

I am... Darn tootin' fun.

DTF.

Seeks same.

I'm Dicing.

WINSTON: You know, I'm really enjoying the police academy,

but, believe it or not, I am not clicking socially with the other cadets.

What? Weird.

Oh, my God.

No. That's crazy.

That is super shocking news.

I can't wrap my head around that.

That just doesn't add up.

Everyone's got a nickname but me.

Yo, Swoops! What up, g*n? (chuckles)

Hey, Winston Bishop.

Why don't you just go ask them if you can hang out with them sometime?

I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

Just invite myself? Now, that's just rude.

Winnie the Bish wasn't raised to be rude.

Now, save my seat. I got to go make a caca.

I can't believe we're gonna live with a cop.

I mean, can we still do illegal things? Like, I don't know, what if I want to get stoned or something?

I've actually never gotten stoned before.

You've never been stoned?

What?

Should I do it before he becomes a cop?

We could do this.

Really?

We're adults. We can smoke a little weed.

I think we should do it.

It's been a while.

I pick up stuff really quick.

You can't just pick up pot and be good at it.

Like everything else in life, it takes practice.

Yeah, if pot were a piano, Nick would be a nine year old Chinese girl.

Daddy's here to take care of you. I'm gonna guide you through it.

I'll be your spiritual guru.

And Mommy's got nothing to do this afternoon, so I'm gonna bake some damn brownies so we can all freak out.

Let's do it.

We're getting stoned?

This is like watching a meeting of idiot 12 year olds.

The hell is that? What is that noise?

(ringtone playing)

Your cellular technology.

I haven't gotten a non text message in two years.

Jess?

Hey, uh... So, I Diced and it was great. Um, but could I get a ride?

You sure you don't want to hop on for a second?

Do you have a dog, or is this all you?

Which would you prefer?

(barks)

Schmidt, will you at least just talk to me, please?

He looked nice in his picture.

The frame cut off the bottom of his beard, so how was I to know it was braided into a beardy tail?

Mmm.

He asked me to the food court near his house.

I thought that was down to earth, and I liked that.

He didn't bring any money, so we had to go back to his apartment.

And also he wanted to show me some of his old baby clothes.

(groans)

Maybe I'm not ready for Dice.

Will you just help me, please?

I want to get back out there. I have to...

I need to get back out there.

And I know I'm gullible.

'Cause people tell me that, and I have no reason not to believe them.

Teach me to Dice.

Is that a yes?

(mutters)

Schmidt?

What's happening?

Ah! What the hell?

I will teach you Dice.

Welcome and... good morning.

It's weird here in the morning.

It is very sad.

Now, over the next 1,000 minutes, your notions of dating will be challenged.

Jess, just listen. No notes.

I'm sorry.

You put notebooks and pens on the table, so I thought...

I totally get it.

Look, Jess, you're nervous. Would you like some water?

Oh, thank you.

Of course.

That's really nice of...

Never show weakness.

Write that down. Now, you're on Dice and this hunk shows up.

Hubba hubba, mama in trubba.

Don't ever do that again.

Okay. So you find this man. He looks like a Hemsworth, if you will.

He swipes down, you swipe down, you guys set a date. I show up.

Hey, how you doing? I'm Jack Steele.

Hi, Jack.

(buzzing)

Wrong.

Is that our Taboo buzzer?

Not important. Why did I buzz?

Do you think you could just return it to the box when you're done?

The reason I buzzed is because I look nothing like this person.

Look at this. There's a sun-kissed sweetie.

I am a rugged Semitic prince.

I thought we were role playing.

Role playing?

What about this feels like a game to you?

(buzzing)

(phone chimes)

Ooh, I got a Dice match.

Jacob.

He has dreamy eyes.

Them's joint bank account eyes.

Okay, if you're saying things like "dreamy eyes" to my face, we have more work to do than the Kings of Leon.

Good band, but it feels like they are stuck in one place musically.

Well, I have a good feeling about this guy.

Okay.

I'm gonna ask him out.

Hey.

You're not ready yet.

I'm s... I'm sorry about your phone.

I'm sure you have the protection plan.

I do have the...

(buzzing)

Never get the protection plan!

NICK: The oceans are very wild.

No man or piece of scientific technology has ever been to the bottom of the ocean.

Titanic did.

Uh, Titanic sunk down there, but that's not to the bottom.

No, the man who made Titanic did.

I don't know what Manhoo is, but...

You guys seem a lot higher than me.

Well, it hits everybody at different times, Hoss.

But it's coming for you.

My people! (chuckles)

Time to rally, everybody. We are going to a party.

I took Cece's advice and decided to invite myself to hang out with some of the other guys, and I think y'all should roll with.

Make me look cooler.

I'll totally go to a party on your butt.

What?

(laughing)

No. No.

Now, that is a humorous image.

What?

But, seriously, you have to go.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Know-know what? We're gonna go.

We're gonna go.

Okay. We're gonna go.

We're gonna go. We're gonna go.

You're gonna go?

Hey, we're gonna go.

We're gonna go.

We're gonna go.

Right on, right on.

Well, then we'll go.

(chuckling): Yeah.

You guys are way too messed up to be going.

You're not an expert. I am.

Nobody knows we're stoned.

If we didn't go, then they would know.

You're saying that be... if we don't go to the party, they're gonna think that we're high.

Oh, the guy who's never done weed.

That's not the proper term. It's "smoked weed."

You don't "do weed." That's a test.

You said it. Listen to me, first order of business, we eat their food.

Okay.

Then you look at the pool.

"Aw, what a great pool.

I wish... I wish I could dive for rings."

Because if you were stoned, you wouldn't dive for rings.

Um, I was just thinking of this impression.

Who am I doing?

Who am I doing?

Al Pacino?

Maybe. So, then, you get home, you eat some pizza...

Trust me. I just thought of every single possibility of what could happen at that party, and none of them are bad.

Ooh. Wow.

This is a big party. I'm talking wall-to-wall cops.

Man.

Oh, I did not think this through.

(giggling)

It just h*t me.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

And that is why... No matter how tricked out it is...

You never get into a van.

"...van."

Okay, moving on.

Classic warning signs.

Now, last night, the crazy man said he needed to meet you near his house.

What he was really saying was, "I expect tonight to end in sex."

Or maybe he doesn't like to be far from his pets.

Never date a man with pets. The only acceptable pet for a man to have is a saltwater fish. Okay, what now?

Okay, first test. Now, I'm gonna say something, and you tell me what's really being said.

Oh, you know, I'm just staying in a hotel right now.

"I like to travel."

(buzzing)

Homeless. Pervert.

Oh, my God, my mom is just the most amazing woman.

Oh. "I love my mother."

(buzzing)

Virgin. And somehow also a pervert.

I kind of prefer public transportation.

Oh. Earth-conscious.

(buzzing)

Multiple DUIs.

(buzzing)

Pervert.

Okay, time for the next phase.

Next phase?

Jess?

Hi. I'm Malcolm. From Dice?

Oh...

Oh.

Hi.

Hey.

She'll be with you in just a minute.

Okay.

You set me up on a date? I'm wearing my lounge-around underwear. I set you up on ten dates.

What?

Ten years of experience in one day.

Expert by midnight.

The Dice Diez.

"Diez" is Spanish for ten.

Are you insane, Schmidt? I'm not ready.

That's like taking a musical from rehearsals straight to Broadway. You got to workshop it first...

If you are for one second suggesting that I don't know how to open a musical...

How dare you? I'm trying to help you out here.

Now, of course you're not ready, Jess.

That's why I set up ten dates.

Now, you can do this. Come on.

All right.

So...

So.

Date talk.

Okay. (chuckles) What do you do?

Um, well, I don't have a job, currently, right now, in the traditional "nine to five" sense, but, uh, I got a lot cooking.

I "grow" "raisins."

I'm sorry, Malcolm, um, I'm gonna have to... (whispering): Get out of there. let you finish that story.

Oh, okay. I grow two types of raisins.

There's the Leopold raisin, which is from Austria.

Mm-hmm.

And then there's the Zwiebel raisin, which is also from Austria.

But I think the main thing that got me through my time in prison was the realization that a "raisin" can be anything.

We got to go!

(in Southern accent): Ma called. The bees are back.

Ma called. The bees are back.

Oh, okay. Um...

Should I just... Should I wait for you?

You know that was a bad date, right?

I know, but I just felt so trapped.

Just do what I did, make up an excuse and then leave.

Just, just say as little as you need to, okay?

Make it your own.

You ready? Yeah.

You can do this.

Okay.


You have so much hair. What?

Where did all that hair come from?

You're like a lioness.

So, did you know you could put a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it without plucking it or preparing it at all?

(whispering): Keep it simple.

Uh, let's keep it simple.

You're a nice guy, and that's a neat outfit.

Are you a chef? Are you a beatnik?

Are... Do you work on... on a submarine?

Shh.

No! No!

Oh. Stand down, sir!

We found your son.

He's alive.

They found my son; he's alive.

I'm sorry. It was nice meeting you.

WINSTON: All right, now, remember, y'all are my dogs, okay?

So just stay by my side and make me look cool.

If I tell a joke, dogs got to bark.

(laughs) I want to see those tails wagging out there, okay?

Oh, okay, look.

Look, there's Dugan. There's Dugan.

That's the guy I was telling you about. Come on.

Over there is better.

All right.

What?

Whatever the hell that means.

Is there a cop in the house? (laughs)

I feel really calm. Really relaxed.

Oh, look, a hummingbird.

What the hell are you talking about?

There's no such thing as a hummingbird.

Birds don't hum.

They sing.

They basically invented singing.

You're so high right now, man.

You're so high, I couldn't possibly even bring you back.

Actually, dude, I feel really good.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, when you walk, you look like an insane person.

Okay? And your voice sounds so stoned and crazy.

Say something.

Hello, Nick.

(laughs)

That took you, like, 20 minutes.

"Hello, Nick."

And now I'm a model and a bartender.

But I...

I'm not sure what's next. I feel a little lost.

I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with my life.

I'm so sorry.

What was your question again?

I didn't ask you anything.

You just walked up and started talking.

So, man, I'm in the locker room, and I see a spider, and I'm like, "I hope this is Charlotte's Web and you're nice."

You haven't seen Charlotte's Web?

Charlotte's Web, the, uh, cartoon.

The tale about the spider who was super chill and super cool.

Then, well, series of events, she ended up dying.

So that was sad.

That was sad, but spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.

I'm sure you... You haven't seen it.

Where are my dogs?

I took the liberty of writing down some exit lines, because obviously, you can't come up with any on your own.

Here, take a look at those.

I've got hockey practice?

Sure.

My boss is trying to contact me about a project that could save the company.

Mm-hmm.

Schmidt, these are such obvious rejections.

I don't want to hurt their feelings.

Hurt their feel...

Do you just walk around all day thinking about other people's feelings?

Yeah. Don't you?

No.

How do you get anything done?

It's hard.

Okay, Jess, how can I put this?

You're the prize here.

Okay?

You are the last piece of pie, and all of these guys are the fat kids in the cafeteria, and I can say that because I used to be fat as a truck.

You really think I'm the last piece of pie?

Damn right you're the last piece of pie.

You're the best girl on Dice, Jess.

And who cares what these guys are feeling?

You know, what do you feel?

Jess, what do you want?

I'm the pie.

You're the pie. I'm the pie.

Say it again.

I'm the pie.

Say it again.

I'm the pie.

There you go.

Who are you?

Never really thought about that.

Mmm.

I'm not gay, but I would go crazy on Michael Strahan.

A prominent U.S. senator is trying to contact me.

You know, I just think Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.

An important document has gone missing.

I need to find it.

I've been getting into a lot of fist fights lately.

Like, a lot.

More than usual.

But, you know, I'm kind of enjoying them now.

I have an acquaintance who's in jeopardy.

Jess?

Nope, not Jess.

Velcro shoes, pervert.

I didn't even see those.

I would love for you to share... share... what you think I should do with my life.

Am I boring you now?

Officer, can I read you your rights?

You have the right to remain hugged.

(laughter)

Oh, no, Coach!

And you have the right to remain sweet.

(laughter)

Run! Diversion!

Run! Run! Now! Now! Uh, du...? Whoa. Hold on!

What's with your friends, Winston Bishop?

They kicked over the grill, and then they ran that way.

Yeah... I know.

Wow. Last date.

It's a big moment.

Oh, my God, is that who I think it is?

I give you Dreamy Eyes Jacob.

Happy Dice birthday, Jess.

You're ready for this. Now, go get him.

Thank you, sir.

JESS: Wait a minute.

Are you from Portland?

The Jolly Cow Creamery.

Yeah, I used to work there summers in high school.

No way. I'm from Portland, too.

Are you serious?

Yes. I used to go there all the time in high school.

Oh, my God.

That's so funny.

(laughter)

Yeah, I hope you like this place.

I live, like, right across the street, so...

Oh. (clears throat) I get it.

You asked me here because -you want me to go home with you.

Wait. What?

No. Um, you know what? I got to go.

I have hockey practice.

I'm center wing, so they really need me. I... Wow.

Okay, I just live across the street.

I'm not some weirdo trying to lure you back to my apartment.

I thought we were kind of hitting it off.

Guess you just make a snap decision, and then that's it, so...

All right, well, have a good practice.

And by the way, there's no center wing in hockey.

The Dice Diez!

You did it!

This thing is on!

How do you open it?

Oh, wow. This isn't even champagne.

Look, it's a super fancy salad dressing.

That is delightful.

We're celebrating... Me and you. Jess, you can have whatever you want on the menu. They got pizza, gelato, Tikka Masala.

A raw bar. This place is doing too much.

They can't be doing all this right. What's wrong with you?

I just don't understand how what we did today is gonna help me find love.

Love?

Well, why would you want to fall in love?

Why else would I go on dates?

The point of dating is just to keep on dating, and then never stop.

It's like burning fossil fuels or seeing a therapist.

No. Schmidt, the whole point of going on dates is to fall in love and have a relationship.

Like, don't you ever worry that you're missing out?

I mean, you're plowing through all these girls, and some of 'em might be great, but you'll never know.

Do you want to go through life that way?

Yeah.

I don't.

Oh, hey, yeah. I'll take the, um... the rock shrimp meatballs.

What is this place?

(shushing)

I think my life is going nowhere.

Oh. Mmm.

No, Cece. It's wonderful here.

Do you like to learn?

I do.

I see you going back to school.

I see it, too.

Yes, yes.

I don't see it.

Yes.

She's a bartender. Why would she get paid for it?

(Cece and Coach hum "Pomp and Circumstance") - She's not very good at it.

(all humming "Pomp and Circumstance")

(beatboxing)

On the floor!

Shut up!

(yelling, overlapping chatter)

(shouting and yelling)

CECE: Get the dog!

Get down on the ground!

Yeah, and stay down!

(indistinct, overlapping chatter)

CECE: I'm a student!

Both of you, butts up.

I'm trying.

I'm trying.

(laughter)

See, I see you guys were high, so I got these guys to come and mess with you.

(laughter)

Let's go, man.

Let's never do drugs again.

That was a lot of fun... Toilet.

"Toilet." Is that... is that my nickname?

DUGAN: Yeah, 'cause living with these guys, you got to put up with a lot of crap.

Lot of crap. (laughs)

DUGAN: Let's get a beer.

Thank you very much.

Flush, flush, what's the rush?

Toilet's coming!

You guys want to go back in?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Thanks for coming back.

Sure.

Look, I'm... I'm really sorry.

Um, I was... I don't know where to begin.

Uh, my roommate taught me all of these phony excuses to get out of dates.

Well, anyway, that is not me.

Okay.

So... will you give me another chance to get to know you?

Yeah.

Let's go back in and get a drink.

Yes. Great.

Hey, uh, you know, we can just make that last date disappear.

Like... this coin.

(laughing): Oh.

You're a magician.

No. Ugh. No.

I'm a comedy magician.

Even better.

And, like a lot of people in comedy, I have a little problem with, uh... Nose candy.

Uh-oh.

Can't have this. It's my last one.

(laughing): No...

I'm kidding. Take it.

I don't want it.

Please take it.

No, you take it.

Okay. Let's go in.

(quietly): Schmidt?

I totally didn't think I'd ever hear from you again.

Well, you know, I just figured, why not see if there's something here?

You know, let's hang out, get to know each other.

There's a coffee place down the street.

Maybe we could go... Grab a cup of joe.

I don't think you understand Dice.

Okay.

(door closes)

SCHMIDT: Jessica!

I'm late to officiate a giant's wedding, and these are stuck.

(Jacob giggles)

Now the rings are free, but the groom is imprisoned forever.

I know how he feels.

You know what they say.

You got to cr*ck a few eggs to, uh... make an Amish.

It's an egg.

It's an Amish person.

My uncle is on f*re.

So, you've seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat, but have you ever seen a hat pulled out of a rabbit?

No, no!

Oh, my... Okay, this date is over.





I can't. I can't do it.

Oh, of course you can and you will.

Okay, Schmidt, we've been to 11 weddings in a row.

That's too many weddings.

I can't even get into the fridge anymore.

Aah!

I'm so hungry.

Why does everybody get to have a party for everything in their life?

Why can't I have a party for really dedicating myself to knitting this summer?

God, I hate that you knit. I hate everything about it.

Why?

It makes me angry and scared all at the same time.

Just like when I hear the phrase, "Academy Award winner Anna Paquin."

Jessica, you are going to this wedding.

Well... well...

And I'm gonna tell you why: Sexual intercourse.

Do you remember that?

You got to get back out there, Jess.

The last mouth that you kissed was Nick's mouth.

That was four months ago.

Think about that. That's horrible.

Hey. Is Schmidt making fun of me?

Yes.

Hi, Nick.

Okay, cool. Just checking.

Are you wearing tap shoes?

I got 'em at the goodwill. I thought they were just really shiny dress shoes.

(Clicking)

They're cool.

Coach: Hey, what do you guys think about this belt? Like for a wedding gift?

Nick, Coach, get in here.

Everybody in here.

Are we a man down?

I feel like there's one more of us.

Something's going on in Jess' room?!

I'm coming!

(Moans)

Just wait for me.

He's sore from police academy.

I'm sore from police academy!

Okay, we have gone to wedding after wedding this summer, and, with the exception of Coach and myself, none of us have truly taken advantage of the sexual opportunities that a wedding provides.

Jess: Not true.

Wedding number seven, an unneutered dog ran after me, so...

(Scoffs)

I made out with a bridesmaid.

Jess: You did?

Yes.

She was wearing a hospital bracelet and carrying a d*ad goldfish in a bag.

(Snorts) She was still a bridesmaid.

Coach: She looked like the snowman from Frozen.

Hey, aim for the middle.

The ride's rough at first, but the body adjusts.

(Thud, clattering)

I'm all right! I just rolled off the couch.

Winston, please!

I can't close my ass!

We are hooking up tonight, all five of us, including the gimp.

This is the last wedding of summer, which means it is our last chance.

Nobody meets anybody in fall...

No.

Or winter. What, are you gonna gamble on the unknown contents of a bulky sweater?

Not me.

Do you realize how important this is?

I do.

Winter... is coming.

No one comes home alone.

You know what, yeah.

Yeah, I'm in.

She's in. We're all in.

Yeah.

Yes.

I'm in.

I can't hear what's going on, but I'm in.

All five of us out there together, in the wild, getting some strange, like a sex fist.

I'm sorry, what?

Mm, that's not what you mean.

What's a sex fist, now?

One, two, three, four, five of us, together, make a fist.

You're making a mistake right now.

Schmidt, Nick, Coach, Winston, Jess... sex fist.

When you put them all together, Nick: No, that's not right. tearing our way through the reception.

Slow down.

Are you listening to what you're saying?

Isn't that sweet? It's a metaphor for togetherness.

It could just be a fist.

All five of us sex-fisting our way...

S04E01
The Last Wedding

Hi, everybody. Uh, I'm Ted. I'm, uh...

I'm Mark's best friend and his best man.

I-I've known mark since he was in diapers, you know?

Uh, and, by that, I mean junior year of college.

(Laughter)

Ah, what about him, Jess?

What? The best man?

Best man.

Get real, you clown.

I've been out of the game too long.

He's a wedding celebrity.

Everybody say hi to Nana.

How great does Nana look, everybody?

Give it up for Nana.

Six months sober.

(Laughter)

I'm kidding. Three months.

(Laughter)

Jess, come on. Get in there.

What?

You got this.

Think so?

Yes, you got the bangs parted.

You're looking good.

Really?

Yes.

Okay.

Wait a minute. Hold on.

Stick your boobs out. Gotta turn the headlights on.

Ew! Schmidt.

But you got it.

Sex fist.

All right.

Hi.

Hi to you.

(Chuckles)

I'm Coach.

Oh, my God.

You don't remember me?

Yeah...

Yeah, I remember... (Yells)

Ooh... Ooh...

I'm good.

It's the end of the wedding season.

We've got some repeats.

Oh, God. What is she doing here?

I thought she was in Australia.

How do I look?

How-how Jewish?

I mean, like, good Jewish or bad Jewish?

Oh, I won't say... it feels like a trap.

Come on. Come with me.

I haven't told the guys that you broke up with Buster yet, 'cause, um...

I feel like I might have to tell Schmidt outside a hospital, like, you know, when you give a baby peanut butter for the first time?

Yeah.

You're not doing this tonight.

What?

You're not doing this tonight.

I'm not listening to you.

You're not doing this tonight.

I'm picturing CeCe naked.

Stop doing this!

CeCe has a boyfriend, and your obsession with her is not good for you, man.

She's been away all summer, and you have been k*lling it!

Mostly hand stuff.

Who had sex with a bridesmaid on a 45-minute flight to San Jose?

Me.

You were boarding group "d."

She was "b." How's that even possible?

Gotta think outside of the box, my man.

Now get your little white butt back out there and finish the summer of sex that you started.

That's what I'm talking about.

CeCe gone.

See that bridesmaid right there?

The pretty one?

Schmidt: Sure do.

The foxy lady?

Mm-hmm.

Well, you're going home with her tonight.

And I got your back.

Look at that.

She looks like the girl from the commercial playing tennis with a tampon in.

Let's do it.

Hi. I'm Jess.

Hi. I'm Ted.

Cheers.

Cheers.

So you're from Wisconsin... (Voice squeaks)

(Clears throat)

(Coughs)

I'm sorry. Is this thing on?

You're making your throat like a microphone.

Yeah. (Goofy, raspy cough)

That's funny!

Thank you.

Yeah.

Woman: I loved your speech.

Oh.

Hi. I'm Kat.

Hi.

I'm Ted.

Kat: Really nice to meet you.

Yeah. Oh.

Excuse me.

My girlfriend's getting jealous.

Kat: Perfect specimen.

Ted is the only eligible guy here, and we are his two best options for procreation.

Oh.

I'm not trying to intimidate you, I just want you to know who you're dealing with if we're both gonna compete for this man tonight.

What?

Here are the facts: I am technically a genius, I have a photographic memory and I lost my virginity to Malcolm Gladwell.

Okay...

Have you ever heard of plutoxic syndrome?

That's because I cured it.

You're welcome, vaginas everywhere.

(Goofy voice): Oh, thank you very much.

I'm sorry, that was...

vag*na voice, and a...

It was a huge mistake.

I stay current on sporting events.

I watch 30 minutes of p*rn every night just to stay up to date on the latest sex trends.

In the coming months, I'm predicting a throwback to missionary.

It all depends on what happens in Syria.

Well, have you ever had sex when you were really, really, really, really, really, really tired?

I'm never tired.

I'm the better choice of mate.

From a purely biological standpoint, you're shorter, weaker, and dumber.

No offense. I love those shoes.

I love your shoes.

But I love your shoes.

Your shoes.

No, I love your shoes.

Your shoes.

Your shoes.

(Very quiet): Your shoes.

(Whispering): Your shoes.

(No voice)

What?

I was just moving my mouth.

So you're competing with her?

Jess: I can take her down, because I have something she doesn't have: You guys.

Now, strategies.

What about you, Coach?

You hook up at weddings all the time.

What's your strategy?

It's called being a gorgeous black man with the body of an action figure.

I could give that a try.

(Laughing) Nick: You want to know what your ex-boyfriend thinks you should do to get the guy?

No, I don't. That's super weird.

Yeah, it's too weird, so... Somebody else.

Okay, look, babe, just get out on the dance floor, okay?

Guys think that they way you dance is the way you have sex.

Okay.

So just give them a little something, okay?

You just need to, like, roll your body a little bit.

Something a little sexy.

Pop your hip out a little bit.

Hey, man, I'm not gonna lie to you right now.

I've got a halfie.

Okay, we got to go!

Excuse me, everybody!

I need a minute.

What do you think of this?

Mm... hmm...

Mm-mm.

I'm good to go now.

Let's go!

All right.

Ugh!

I just want to get back out there, but I feel like I forgot everything I knew.

Do you guys still like an Oakland face with an L.A. booty?

Would you like to know my strategy, Jess?

Is the art of seduction really where you shine?

Be there.

(Laughs): That's it?

Yeah. Just be there.

No matter where he goes, be there.

He gets a drink, be there. He talks to his friends, be there.

At the end of the night, be there.

It's called "the Joe Biden."

That's creepy, man.

The basic concept of what he's saying, though, could actually work.

Yeah.

(Quiet laugh)

I'm gonna biden his ass.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, yeah. Yup. That'll do it.

I know.

Oh, hey! Uh, you know, Kat was just telling me about her hairlessness.

Hmm. She's like a seal.

(Laughs) Hmm. That's okay.

You guys talk.

I'm just gonna be here.

I'm sorry I didn't call you.

Why are you so scared of intimacy?

Who broke your heart and why haven't you forgiven her?

Uh... well... Yeah, the thi...

Huh?

You're arrogant, you're sexist...

You stole my phone charger.

You're conceited. You're a liar.

Aah!

I rented best man holiday.

You're not in it.

So, you know Tom...

Uh, Tom, of course, he wanted to sell shoes for a profit.

And I said, "no."

I said, "you...

You do something better."

You got a... pretty good face.

So, you guys want to come home with us, right?

We want to do a four-way.

Me, her, you and him.

Of course. We'll, uh... Nick?

(Knocks)

Nick?!

Hi. How are you?

Hi. Good. How are you?

Are you enjoying the wedding?

Yeah.

You be... yeah.

Mm!

Hey.

Hey, Nick.

Hey, Schmidt.

Hey, do you know how they sell ice cream at the drugstore...?

I'm not having a four-way with you... end of discussion.

Come on, Nick. We don't have any other choice.

I've found 15 other girls since I've been here.

They're all either married or taken or mad at Coach.

I'm not doing a four-way with you...

It's the last helicopter out of Saigon, my man.

Charlie won.

No, Schmidt.

You won't even know it's me, Nick.

Look, at this point, it's all skin and shapes...

That's-that's what I'm afraid of.

It-it's the fog of w*r, man.

There's so much stuff going on.

You're just, you're just here.

Yeah...

You don't even know what's happening.

Okay, but I want to know what's happening if it's with sex... I don't want some fog of w*r on top of me, if it looks like you.

That's the point.

The fog of w*r is something you can't see through.

Like, the whole thing with the Charlie thing and Vietnam, I don't know who I'm fighting!

I'm soft like a lady. You won't even know.

But what if I get a surprise?

"A surprise"?

What if there's a surprise on me?

There's not gonna be a surprise on you.

What if I'm fighting the w*r and boom... there's a surprise!

You go north, I go south.

Do you know what I'm saying?

I'll be in steerage and I'm rowing.

And I'm rowing and I'm rowing and the...

You're up in the crow's nest.

Fre-fresh air up there, man.

And I'm in the trenches, you know?

I'm digging for coal.

I'm breathing in those fumes.

And you're up here. You're just taking in the sights. You're spotting dolphins, huh?

You're just the handsome prince covered in salty sea spray...

I don't want you calling me handsome before a potential four-way!

This...

Nick, please!

I'm begging you for this.

CeCe is here.

And I can't get her out of my head.

Don't, don't, don't play the CeCe card right now, don't do...

I'm gonna play the CeCe card, okay?

Look, she's here and I don't want to go home alone.

(Groans) I need your help, please.

(Grunts loudly)

What's up, guys?

Tell you what. I am so sore I can't have sex with nobody tonight.

Only thing I want in my mouth is Mr. and Mrs. I.B. Profen.

(Laughs) Minus the mister.

My man... Winston, I got a question for you.

Do you think that, that two men can engage in group sex without... without compromising their friendship.

Good question, good question.

Um... okay.

Uh, let's just say Nick is the salt.

And, Schmidt, you are the pepper.

I'm assuming we're talking about you two.

Hypothetically, I suppose.

Whatever. Yes.

Hypothetically, all right. Not necessarily.

Actually I'm gonna need some...

Ooh, boy.

Seems as if I've made a mess.

Got to clean that up.

Yes, look at that.

Salt all in the pepper.

Pepper all in the salt.

Just mixed up like that.

Is there salt shoved in the pepper hole?

How'd it get in there? How did salt get shoved into this tiny, tiny pepper hole?

Nick?

You're terrible at demonstrations!

Oh, uh...

You know, I-I'm just gonna, uh...

Yeah, Ted. Get crazy.

Leave it all out there on the field.

Okay. (Claps hands)

I'll come back with stories. (Chuckles)

(Both laugh)

Are you bidening?

What? No.

(Whispers): How did you know about that?

Because I'm always gonna be one step ahead of you.

Extreme biden!

(Whispering): Kat.

(Grunts with effort)

Kat, Kat... let me out.

This was a huge mistake.

I'm sorry. I'm not proud of this.

It smells so bad in here.

(Quiet groan)

Ted: Jess?

Hi.

Jess, th-this is the men's room.

This is where it all happens.

Don't wait for me, Ted, 'cause I might be awhile.

See you out on the dance floor.

And at wedding 12, I sat on a men's toilet.

When did one-on-one sex become old-fashioned?

You know, America's got to take a hard look in the mirror at ourself.

We used to make things.

Just be glad you're not single.

Oh.

Actually Buster and I broke up.

So, anyway...

(Groaning): Oh... no!

No!

That is so terrible!

Didn't know you cared this much.

No, no, no, no...

If you're single...

Mm-hmm. that means that I have to do something.

Something awful.

You have no idea what you just did to me.

You have no idea, young lady!

I'll do the four-way with you.

Yes! Okay, I'm gonna go book the room.

You go to housekeeping, have them give you as many shower caps as they'll give you...

Okay, stop.

They're gonna get one hand and I'm not gonna move it.

I'm just gonna dangle it into the mix while I look at something else on my phone.

And that's the deal.

Aw, man, this is gonna be big for us.

This is for you, buddy.

Thanks.

(Laughs): Yeah!

What the hell is that?

What are you talking about?

Yeah, what's-what's that on your hand, man?

Why is it so rough? It's like hoof.

There's nothing on my hand. This is a regular old hand...

I'm out, I'm out. You're out of what?

Four-way. Done. No way.

Not with that thing.

You're a buffoon.

That is ridiculous.

I was only doing it for you, Schmidt, so you don't freak out when you find out that CeCe's single.

And now I'm the weirdo with the hoof hand.

What... take it back from the hoof hand.

What'd you say before? About CeCe being single?

How do you know that?

She's single?

I have my, uh... assumptions.

So CeCe's single now.

You don't know that for sure.

That's interesting.

Why are you so calm?

Interesting.

Don't just say "interesting."

That's interesting.

If you're gonna say "interesting" say why it's interesting.

It is interesting.

(Screams)

Aah!

Nick!

What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

It's the men's room!

Mmm...

Jess, scooch over. All right.

(Groans)

What are you doing? Just hiding in the bathroom?

Kind of.

(Laughs)

(Laughs) Me, too.

I know I'm supposed to, like, "get back out there," you know? But...

Maybe I'm just not built for it.

Man, I hear you.

Sidebar: What do my hands feel like?

Hooves.

Aw, son of a...

Maybe there's a reason I'm not up on a fridge, you know?

Maybe some people are fridge people, and other people are... toilet people.

You think you're a toilet person?

(Laughing) You're not a toilet person.

You want to get on the fridge, you'll get on the fridge, Jess.

Just be yourself, and if he's not into Jessica Day, then there's something wrong with him.

Be myself.

Like do my Tina Turner impression?

How did your brain jump there?

♪ What's love got to do ♪

♪ got to do with it? ♪

(Laughs)

(Laughs) All right.

I hear your logic.

Come on.

No man wants that, but... you can't quit, either.

You're our last hope.

You're the only one out of the group who might not go home alone tonight, Jess.

Really?

Yes.

It's all on your shoulders.

So the sex fist... has... turned into a sex finger.

Uh, don't... yeah.

Sex finger.

Hey. Ted. Um...

(Clears throat) I'm out of moves, so...

I'm just gonna try being myself.

Here's some stuff about me: I've never cured anything.

I'm a middle school vice principal and I love my job.

Um, I'm just getting out of a relationship with a guy that I still live with, which is kind of complicated.

He's over there.

What's up, Nick?

Hi, I'm Nick!

Sometimes I cry when newscasters wish each other "Happy Birthday" on air.

My first crush was on a Batman cake, but my first sexual feelings were about teenage Simba.

'Cause he was super hot, and I still, actually, find him hot.

Uh, truth time. Um...

So that's me.

And if you want to take me home, Ted, we can definitely do some no-bra stuff.

Uh...

That's me naked.

Well...

...and this is me with a guy who I thought was Larry king.

So it's decision time.

Yeah, Ted, who's it gonna be?

Me or Jess?

(Sighs)

Hmm?

Ted: Ooh...

Ted: Wow. Hah.

Ooh...

This is tough.

I mean, okay, 'cause I mean, over here we've got, you know, the whole... you know.

And then, but of course over here we got the... bing, and the... you know.

Mmm...

(Groaning): Oh, God, what do I do?

What do I do?

It's over.

Moment's passed, Ted.

Okay.

I'll take him out.

So you and Buster broke up.

Whew. I'm sorry.

Yeah, I'm just waiting for you to do something weird now.

Yeah, I feel that coming on, so, um...

I'm gonna go.

(Sighs heavily)

You know what doesn't whine and cry is the sperm in my freezer.

I am counting down the days until we don't need men to procreate.

If I really put my mind to it...

Autumn 2018.

Are you ready?

Oh, it's my plan "b."

Yeah. Beats going home alone.

Just giving her a ride.

Nothing weird.

(Whispering): We do this every time.

So, Katherine, uh... Where do you live?

About two inches north of your mouth, Padre.

Bye.

Bye.

Schmidt: It's okay, Jess.

Sex fist is obviously over.

We're all going home alone.

Well, that's where you're wrong, Schmidt.

We're not going home alone.

That's great.

All right.

It's like that.

"Regan, Kevin and Rebecca..."

(Laughing)

"...request the honor of your presence."

How about the honor of my garbage can?

Coach: Hey!

Jess: Those fridge people with their stupid houses...

Oh, look at this one, guys.

Uh, it looks like Jeffrey and Lauren want us to share in their joy.

How about they share in my chocolate pocket?

(Laughing): What does that mean?

In my butt.

Mm-mm.

Jess: That's gross.

Yeah, I...

(Laughing)

Oh, man... how about this one, you guys?

Scott and Derek.

Yeah, real tasteful wedding... for a Thursday!

Nick: Yeah.

Oh, look at that... Laurie and Mitchell.

They had a cash bar.

I hope they can't have kids!

That's super dark, bro.

That was too far. I hope they can...

Yeah!

...I hope they can, I hope they can.

CeCe and Shivrang... You bastards, take that one down.

You know what? It's gone.

(Whoops) No...

Nick: Take that one down!

Oh, yeah.

Jess: Wait a minute.

Who are Gabe and Stephanie, with the profile, these things?

Oh, Gabe's the heavy guy with the perm and the wheelchaiair...

No, Gabe was the guy on the motorcycle...

No, no, no, no. The guy with the perm.

The guy who kept showing his stomach the whole time.

Oh. Schmidt: That's the woman who was eight and a half months pregnant.

The groom was dressed as the bride...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, uh...

This wedding's next week.

What?

What?

(All muttering)

Not anymore.

(Whooping, cheering)

Whoa!

(All laughing)

That's right! Come on, now!

Ripping it up!

(Everyone talking at once)

Oh! Oh! Look at that one.

Rippin' 'em up.

(Whoops)

Rip. Oh, right there.

Yes.

Mmm...

(Laughing) More to rip.





Guys, we're going on a cruise and you guys are coming with us. And none of you have a choice.

(Laughs) A cruise? If I wanted to watch a heavy-set guy in sandals eating with his hands, I would've just posted up and watched Nick in the kitchen.

When we were together, we booked a cruise.

We tried to get our money back, but it's Both: Nonrefundable.

Yeah.

(Laughs) They made that very clear.

Seemed like a safe bet at the time.

I don't want a refund on my cruises and I don't want a refund on you.

We're never gonna die! - Nick: Yeah! - Y'all nasty.

Ah-ha-ha, yeah! Where you going? - Yes! - What are you doing now? Oh, there she goes (Laughs) Turns out, I do want a refund On you.

Give me my money back! Jess: Anyway, they let us downgrade our "lovers' suite" to include four more people.

And that's you guys.

I have some concerns about going on a cruise with two people that just broke up.

Absolutely.

Me, too.

Yeah, I have the same concern as Winnie.

Like, I don't want to go.

I have strong qualms as well.

He got qualms.

Put those qualms away.

Yeah.

It's gonna be fine, okay? - Totally.

We are k*lling this breakup, honestly.

But we're gonna be on a ship in the middle of the ocean with no escape.

What if you guys get in a big fight and we're stuck out there with you? It'll be like a floating, all-you-can-eat prison.

I promise you no weirdness.

Guess that's an excuse to go out and buy a new bikini.

Which could be good.

I'm in.

Full steam ahead! We have two on board! Nope! Let's not do, uh, nautical puns, please.

If we're gonna do nautical puns, we shouldn't We shouldn't go.

That's fair, and I won't.

I'm in, too.

Uh, I have an idea.

Just throwing this out there.

What if we do the cruise on the ground? - Like, on land.

That's silly.

What, are you scared of boats or something? Afraid me, afraid of boats? You're afraid of boats, dude.

Cece: Ha! He's scared of boats? (Laughs) Hold on, hold on.

Oh, my God, you're scared of boats.

Dude! Is it the boats or the water? Can you swim? Yeah.

You feel safe now? I'm not I don't need to be safe, man.

I'm brave! I take dumps standing up! I'm a man! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

Schmidt, do you got any Fisherman's pants I can borrow? What's that? It's a class ring for Cece.

She got her ged and I've been tutoring her, so I had this made.

What? Shame, shame, I know your name Please don't "shame, shame" me, Winston.

(Singsongy): You're still in love with her.

I am not still in love with her, okay? You're alone on a boat with Cece, romantic cruise, and you give her jewelry.

Then what? I tell her that I'm still in love with her and that I want her back, and then we have sex until the boat sinks.

I knew it, I knew it! To the bottom of the ocean.

To the bottom of the ocean.

Oh, man the sand and the mackerel and the chum and whatever the hell else is down there.

And crabs.

Not the crabs.

Yeah.

Don't tell anyone.

I'm serious, Winston.

Do not tell anyone.

What are you doing? You are so weird.

Can you ever just leave the room like a normal person? All (Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Yeah! Coach: A little tight.

With the amount of stuff we're gonna be doing, we're barely gonna be in the room.

(Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Both: Cruise! Cruise.

Cruise Welcome aboard the Wave Dancer, your home for the next five days.

I am your captain, Jan Nortis, and I invite you to dance on the waves with me.

(Cheering) Cruise! Cruise! (Chanting): Cruise! Cruise! Cruise! Cru I'm gonna get drunk! Sorry.

Enthusiasm! I like these people.

Friendship is the most crucial ingredient to any sea adventure.

Second only to buoyancy.

Because a ship has to float.

Ah! Oh, okay.

(Laughing) I didn't know where you was going with it.

Nick: We love you, captain! Whoo-hoo! Everybody, my name is Doug.

Hi, Doug.

Hi, Doug.

Hey, Doug.

I'm Winston.

Does anyone know what to do in case of an emergency? Uh-oh.

It looks like we're all in the same boat.

(Laughing politely) Excuse me.

If we could just continue on without any more nautical puns, that'd be great.

Feels like that's just the lowest form of humor.

Looks like I found a grumpy Gus! - I'm sorry, a what? - Doug: Boo! - All: Boo - Doug: Boo and hiss! Boo.

Folks, if you see Gus frowning around, brighten up his day by giving him a tickle.

A what? - Tickle.

Quit it! Enough! - Tickle.

Tickles I don't like to be tickled, you guys.

Tickle, tickle - All right! Enough! We have fun! (Chuckles) But the ocean does not.

What? Listen to what I have to say if you don't want to die.

Don't worry, Coach.

Everyone who works on a cruise ship is a performer.

They're just doing a show.

So what? What are you talking to me about it for? - I'm not scared.

I just thought you should know.

You're definitely scared.

Sure.

I'm not scared, dude.

What are you talking about? - Yeah, no, of course.

I'm not scared.

You'll live.

It's okay.

Okay, now I need a volunteer to help me with some emergency procedures.

I'll do it.

I don't care.

'Cause I'm not scared.

I'll volunteer my ass off.

(Laughs) I ain't afraid of you! (Laughs) - Let's say it's 3:00 A.

M.

3:00 A.

M.

There's alarms going off - What? freezing seawater up to your ankles.

Adults are screaming, babies are crying! Go, go, go, go, go! You're up on deck! There's an Italian guy strapping chains together! - You don't know what's going on! - I know! - What do you do? - I don't know! What do I do? - What do you do? What do you do? - I-I get, I get in the boat? - You get in the boat! - I get in the boat! You're getting in the boat! - I get in the boat! - Wrong! Wrong! No! The first thing you do is you what? Make sure your life preserver is strapped on correctly.

No, no, screw that, man! I'm gettin' in the boat! Get out of my way! - I'm getting in the boat! - Where you going, Coach? He's paddling to heaven, 'cause he's already d*ad.

Don't say that! Spread your wings, little angel.

Douglas that's a little too much.

Oh, my God! Stroke! Stroke! - Ah, there's two of these! - Okay all righty.

How do you do two of these? - Okay - You're safe.

You're okay.

Stroke! Stroke! (Gasps) You're okay! You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

(Gasping, sobbing) Shh.

Amazing grace I'm not afraid of boats.

How sweet No one's afraid.

(Sobs) The sound Okay, I'm good.

I'm good, I'm good.

You okay? (Screaming) Thank you.

Thank you all for coming to the To the seminar.

Remember to sign up for the volleyball tournament.

Hey, Coach? You okay, buddy? You okay, pal? Nah, you guys, I'm fine.

I'm just gonna I'm gonna hang out in the room for a little bit, okay? - See you later.

Later.

Cruise! Cruise.

Cruise What should we do first? Cheer up, grumpy Gus! All right! Cut your fingernails, man! Ha ha! Nice! With this tickling.

(Laughs) Hey, hey, hey, guys.

The captain's coming.

Nick: It's the captain.

Winston: What's up, captain? Nortis: Hello, again.

I'm captain Jan Nortis, as I previously stated.

I would just like to say that I am a fan of your enthusiasm.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Please don't do that.

Sorry.

I may be a captain, but first and foremost, I am a woman.

Absolutely.

Come on! Did anyone just see that she was flirting like crazy with Nick? That was, like, the most shameless flirting I've ever seen.

"Keep it in your pants" is all I have to say to captain Jan Nortis.

You're being really weird.

You're being weird.

Super weird right now.

Here we go.

This is starting now already.

I am not being weird.

You're creating an awkward situation for no reason.

Don't do this, Jess.

If this ship moves as fast as that captain, we'll be in ensenada by 6:00.

Well, she was flirting with you.

Which I'm okay with, because she is a handsome woman.

Jess, stop.

You're being weird.

No, I'm not being weird.

I'm not being weird! I am, I am being weird.

Okay, focus up for a second.

Okay, they say this is an all-inclusive trip, but you know what that means.

But from their eyes, you have a couple of drinks, and then you're done.

And then what have you paid for? We're smarter than that, okay? We are.

We're gonna take every class, we're gonna do every activity.

We're gonna get our money's worth.

Okay.

Got it? - Yeah.

Uh, Jessica Day and Nick Miller.

All right, Day-Miller party.

Here is your itinerary for the grand romance package.

No! No! Yeah, we're looking for something more like PG-13.

What do you have? Do you have, like, a friendship package or? What package would you recommend for two brothers looking for trouble? The grand romance package is nonrefundable.

Well, we're not doing that, so we're good.

Are you sure? This includes over $600 of activities and - We're gonna do it.

We're not doing it.

$600? That is 600 one-dollar bills.

That's the only way I can imagine it.

We can do this.

Okay.

Yeah.

We're gonna get our money's worth.

We are the best ex-couple in the whole world.

Yeah, we are.

Yes.

Okay? You guys are exes? Yeah, you're not gonna want to do this.

We're doing it.

Give us the folder.

(Sighs) - I just wanted to say - Grumpy Gus! No! No! No! - Grumpy Gus.

Sweet mother of sea dragon! What? What happened? I just witnessed a dolphin being cut straight in half by our keel.

It's a ghastly sight.

What? That's horrible! Terrible.

It's a shame about the dolphin, man.

Really is.

What?! As your bodies become one, follow your breath through your spine to the soles of your feet and into your genitals.

What? (Laughs) Into my genitals? Yeah.

(Laughs) Breathe into your genitals I'm not breathing into my genitals, lady.

All right, lovers, let's get sexy.

Give me your sexiest pose right here.

This is it.

This is it.

Sexiest pose.

That's not it's not romantic in any way.

Think about the first time you kissed.

How was it? If you can move in.

Come back in.

Come back in.

Wow, I've never done a couples massage on exes before.

In case you're wondering what that scar on his back is, it's from falling on a fence when he was six.

I was legally d*ad for ten minutes.

We're going to make all the towel animals you guys find in your rooms every single night! - We made laundry.

Nice.

We're always happy Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy We're just totally different people.

Yeah, we just don't belong together.

(Both laugh) You're really bumming me out.

Hey, Jess, is this doing weird stuff to your eyes? Definitely.

Give me five, man! Leaving me hanging! (Laughs) You know what? You were right.

This isn't weird at all.

No, it isn't.

Are they out of rosÃ©? You know what? This is an old bartending trick, Jess.

Put your glass out.

You go like this No way.

Look at that.

You got some rosÃ©.

You're a genius.

I think I'm smarter at sea.

(Both laugh) You look, you look like you belong here.

What's that, on a ship? Yeah, you, too.

(Both laugh) Oh, yo! Yo! Yo-yo-yo! Yo, pal.

Yo.

Well, that was a mistake.

Yes, it was! That was not on purpose.

My fault, too.

Yep.

Yeah, it was We can't do the grand romance package anymore.

I agree.

We should - No.

It's too much.

It's too intense.

They whip you into this sexual frenzy.

I know.

It's weird.

I just feel like Yeah, 'cause everything's fine.

You know, I feel like a cruise tonight.

It's not, like, a really big deal.

I feel like We're good.

Everything's good.

Yeah, no problem, no problem.

All right, bye, dude.

Bye.

Jess, I've been looking all over for you.

I was hoping that as a group, we could do a little night fishing that I already put a deposit down on, so we're going.

And if we don't catch anything, they'll let us sh**t a machine g*n directly into the water.

That is international waters for you, baby.

I would really love nothing more than to go out there and sh**t a bunch of fish in the face with you, but I think that's more of a Nick thing.

And yesterday, we decided it would be better for everyone if we just spent the rest of the time apart.

What? I'm really sorry.

I wanted this to be a great vacation for you guys.

But look, we split up the ship: I took starboard, he took the other one.

I got the starboard and she got the other side.

What are you doing, man? You're hanging out by an exhaust vent.

It keeps the left side of my face warm and it sounds like the ocean.

More than the ocean sounds like the ocean? Come on, Nick.

You guys can't be separate the whole trip.

The trip just made it clear.

The breakup's too hard.

I don't think we can be friends for a while.

What? You're not gonna be friends with Jess? And even you guys said it.

It's just too weird.

Nick, man, that's like the president and the vice president not being best friends.

They're not best friends.

Come on.

Everybody knows they're best friends.

They work together, but they're not best friends.

Dude, they're the president and the vice president.

Okay.

I mean, is this something you're okay with? No, I'm not okay, but what am I gonna do? Well I mean, look, man, we all have to be together on this trip.

That's why we came here.

Nick, there's gotta be something I can do.

Yeah, you know what you can do? Yeah, anything, come on.

You can cash in my skee ball tickets on the other side of the boat.

Get me one of those toy spiders that I was talking to you about before.

And if they're out - All right, man, all right.

then grab me a bunch of erasers? The opportunity has not presented itself as I'd hoped it would, so I'm creating it now.

When I say, "May our progeny bathe in the infinite glow," that's your cue.

Now, what what did I just say? You repeat it so I know that you know the cue.

May our pro what? What's wrong with you? Unbelievable.

I don't know what you're saying.

I'll just say, "go," okay? When I say, "go," you start to play.

And before she sees, just get behind get behind the vent.

Get behind the vent.

(Clears throat) Cece Hmm? Hey.

Um, your hair in the moonlight It looks so shiny.

You know, I'm trying to get a signal so I can talk to Buster, but it's just impossible out here.

In the moonlight, your eyes, they sparkle like, like fish eyes.

I got one.

Now, like, what, do I have to hold it at this angle the whole time? Why is it so important for you to get in touch with Buster? (Sighs) Look, you know better than anyone that I don't have the best of luck with relationships.

And I know you think he's young for me.

I don't.

I just want you to be happy.

Thank you.


Winston: Guys, guys! You got to come with me right now.

Be warned, though.

There is a weird guy with a violin hiding behind this vent.

A what? Dude! (Groans) - What's going on? - Come on right.

I will I will knock you out where you stand, sir.

Get back there.

They're gonna take a break from being friends for a while? What does that even mean? Guys, this is on us.

We're the ones who put the pressure on them to not be weird.

I know.

What were we thinking? Of course they're gonna be weird.

They just broke up.

Hey, that's on y'all.

I-I have nothing to do with that.

I've just been chilling in the room.

Hanging out, singing songs.

You are safe in the room You are safe, you will live I've been trying to get them to talk to each other all morning, okay? (Humming) I passed up on breakfast pizza and singles bingo.

And those bingo chicks? Oh, they put out.

Bingo! They're not gonna listen to us.

(Quietly): Don't-don't ever do that again.

The bingo thing? That's what they It's funny, that's what they say when I You know who they will listen to, though? - A doctor.

The president! - The ca What were you - What were you gonna say? - The captain.

The captain.

(Over p.

A.

): Attention, this is your captain.

Would Nick Miller and Jessica Day please return to their stateroom for a non-life-thr*at but necessary official maritime reason.

This is not an emergency.

It is definitely not.

Hey! Did you hear the captain? Yes! Go, go, go! (All clamoring) Everybody inside! This is not a drill! Okay! Okay, the door is locked.

The "Do not disturb" sign has been employed.

We are not leaving here until you guys are friends again.

We just wanted to spend our vacation alone.

Yes.

On separate strange parts of this ship.

Yeah, it's I really wanted to see how the ship worked.

I think it's interesting.

And I really wanted to see how the other side of the ship worked.

Yeah.

It's interesting.

We should've never asked you guys not to be weird around us.

Mm-hmm.

We-we want you to be weird around us.

Yeah.

Just let us in.

Open your cellar doors, and let us taste your jams.

You want to "taste our jams"? - Again, you have lost me.

Listen to yourself for once in your life.

Jess: It's my jam and you can't have it.

First of all, that's my ex-girlfriend's jam, dude.

I put a ban on jam.

Okay, you know what? All of us are weird.

But we're all still friends.

So, let's talk about it.

I'll go first.

I've made out with half of the guys in this room.

Okay.

That's a start.

All right.

That's a start.

And I have had nightmares about making out with the other two guys in this room.

So, yourself? - And me.

Nick and Winston.

Cece: Okay.

Okay.

It's good for you to finally admit that.

I respect that.

Yeah, thanks for sharing.

Um, it really bums me out that I'll never know the infinite joy of what it feels like to carry a child inside of me.

Wow.

Okay, Coach! That's honesty.

That's real honest.

That's how it's done.

Okay, um Here we go, up we go.

I feel like it is really weird that I live with my ex-boyfriend.

See? There you go! - Nice! Just turn on the tap.

You know, let it out.

Really nice.

That was cool that you admitted that.

I feel weird about living with my ex-girlfriend.

Yeah.

You know, I think it's a landmine for trouble.

What's gonna happen when other hunks come around? What's gonna happen when you bring some ho-bag in the house? Exactly! Like, that it's scary stuff, and I feel like when a breakup happens, you mostly get away.

'Cause I'm gonna b*at her ass.

What if she's bigger than you? She probably will be.

(Laughs): Oh, snap! That was good.

(All laughing) Good for you! Yeah! I saw that, man.

That's how it all starts.

This is how it starts.

Good.

That's good, man, that's really good.

Yeah.

Well, it's nice to talk to you about this.

Yeah, it was really weird when you Tried to kiss me last night, (Groans) And you licked my ear.

What?! What?! - You guys kissed last night? - This is so confusing! - What?! It was just a lapse.

We were drunk.

You guys are getting back together? We're not getting back together.

You're confusing everybody! No, it was the grand romance package.

My God! They were, like, folding these towels.

It was so sexy.

You try folding towels like that and see if you don't get turned on.

Yeah, because they fold the towels like vaginas.

They're swans, dude.

And the yoga instructor was, like, breathing into our genitals, and, like It opened everyone up.

(Clicks tongue) Yeah.

In a real true way.

Absolutely.

This thing was ready to talk to that thing again.

Emotionally and sexually.

Yeah.

What?! What?! - What's wrong with you, man? - Are you crazy? - Schmidt: Just pick one either You're together or you're not! (All clamoring) Winston: Gonna punch you in the face, bro! Things are really weird.

Agreed.

But I'm okay with it.

Me, too.

Hey, there.

Aw! What? All right, okay.

Good enough, good start.

Wonderful.

Thank you for doing this weird intervention thing.

This was pretty great.

Yeah, it worked out.

I think everybody's good now.

Let's go eat our weight in fake crab.

There you go.

Absolutely.

There we go.

Great idea.

I'm gonna get drunk.

Winston: I gotta get psyched up.

Gotta get psyched up.

The door's stuck.

Is that part of your thing? No.

Well, call security.

I got rid of the room phone.

I-I thought it was gonna be got rid of the phone? - More intense than this, I-I'm sorry! - You m*rder us! - Open up! Open up! - What? No.

Watch out.

You know what? It's just, it's usually the handle.

Just, like, get the handle - I'll do it, I'll do it! I got it.

All right, move.

I got it.

Guys, guys, guys! Okay, here we go.

Calm down.

How long could it take for someone to hear us? Oh.

(Flies buzzing) We did bad things to the tub.

(Speaks in Spanish) I got the sugars.

I'm the sugar man.

(Laughs) Silence! I have the talking soap! (Crying) Oh! I'm the queen of Wednesday! It's so nice to have a family portrait.

We should shower less.

I think we look really great.

I'm really glad we framed this.

I mean, what a proud moment.

It is cool being in the paper, though.

(Laughs) Part of me d*ed on that boat.

(Laughs): Oh.

I will never be the same again.

All right, man.

Take a nap.

Sleep it off, man.

I'm sorry.

Is Cece checking out Schmidt? What?! Let me see that.

Huh? (Laughs) What are you talking about, Winston? Winston (Singsongy): Shame, shame, I know your name.

You do not know my name, Winston.

Winston: Cece got a boyfriend who used to be Betty! Cece: Yeah, you better run, bitch.

Winston: Ow! Ow! Ow! That's my mustache! (Sighs) You know, I've been thinking a lot - about your sleeping arrangements and - Weird.

I might have an idea on how to make things a little bit less weird.

Really? What is it? Two words.

Bunk beds.

No.

(Laughs) No, I'm not putting bunk beds in my room, Schmidt.

Not in your room.

In my room.

It'll be just like college, my man.

Only with way more sex.

What? - That came out wrong.

I'm not bunking with you, Schmidt.

(Laughs) Yeah, he is.

Yeah, he is.

Yeah, he is.

There's gonna be a lot of rules, - and I'm gonna make most of them.

You can make them all, man! Except for the ones that I make! (Both laugh) Schmidt: First one in gets dibs!





Thanks for helping me with my school dance.

"Love is forever, and ever, and ever, and" - How many "and ever"s? - Technically infinity, but I could only fit 12.

Well, this is going to be tough for you, huh? Yes! Foster said we couldn't afford it, but I really stuck my neck out for this dance.

No, I-I mean because the theme of the dance is "Love is forever" and Nick, and the breakup What? No, Cece, look, you remember what school dances were like for me.

They were miserable.

I was just waiting in the bathroom for to magically appear and ask me out.

I remember.

I was smoking in the stall next to you.

We get it, you were bad.

I just don't want it to be like it was for me.

I want them to have an incredible time.

My life is a bit of a mess right now, but the one thing I can do is throw an amazing dance for them.

"Love is forever, and ever, and ever" - What is this? - The theme of Jess's school dance.

It's pretty ironic, huh? - Jess, you poor thing.

Come-come here.

Come here.

What? What? Just there.

What are you doing? - All right.

Uh-huh.

Okay.

Oh, I know.

I know.

I know.

What's happening? I got hug number two locked and loaded.

Soft or hard, it's up to you.

I know.

Schmidt Ay-ay-ay, I needed a shvitz.

Ech, me, too.

My arms are so sore from doing so many push-ups.

That seems like a lie.

No, I'm trying to stay fit after the breakup.

I've been eating salads, yeah, no dressing, - mostly just the protein.

What kind of salad you've been eating? - The little chopped of pieces of ham.

Just the ham? - Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

I don't like the lettuce.

I think it's gross to eat stuff on earth that's green.

Well, look, you know baby steps - Not baby steps, - there were some pretty big pieces of ham.

Okay.

It's still not as good.

I genuinely miss goofing around with Jess.

Breakups aren't supposed to be easy, so Well, it's really mature of you, man.

We're doing something where we are we are not allowed to be in the room alone together without Winston.

'Cause he just naturally takes the sexual tension out of a room.

What'd you guys want? You see? I'm proud of you.

That's what I'm talking about.

We're men.

We've felt pain, we've survived it.

Look at me.

I'm watching Cece drool over some 20-year-old.

How could she be interested in a boy when she could have these ripe berries? Look at these, Nick.

Put your towel down.

Oh, God, I need a shvitz.

Why does my sweat smell like asparagus? He does take all the sexual tension out of a room.

Man, I heat up every room I walk into.

Put me next to a dozen eggs.

They hatching.

You know why? 'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.

There was no sexual tension in here before he got here.

Keep telling yourself that, Nick.

Congrats, chaperones! With your help, tonight is going to be unforgettable.

I didn't sign up for this.

No, you didn't.

None of you did.

In fact, none of you have ever, ever signed up for any school event, ever.

Which means you've never felt the joy of exchanging your free time for a child's smile.

I never volunteer because of my Munchausen syndrome.

Are we getting paid? You will get paid, um, actually, in attractive hats that I made.

They say "chaperone.

" And Gary the Janitor has one that says "clean up crew.

" You call me Gary the Janitor as if me being a janitor is my whole identity.

It's like someone calling you Jess the Third-Hottest White Teacher.

Okay.

Are we done? I'm gonna say we're done.

Yeah.

Okay.

Thank-thanks, guys.

Good-good meeting.

I don't know where I'm supposed to be right now.

Thanks, guys.

It's gonna be great! You don't have to wear that, Coach.

As far as I'm concerned, this dance starts now.

I know how important this dance is to you.

Those kids won't get away with anything.

They want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me.

Wait.

If they want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me! Wait.

Hey, Wendy.

Whoa! That shirt's scary! Whoa.

You going to the dance tonight? My mom's making me go.

Making you go to the best night of your life? Your mom sounds really cool.

Come one, at your age, love is forever and ever and ever.

What are you gonna wear? This shirt.

Oh.

Oh! That is the best idea I've heard all week.

Whoa! Scary shirt! We all think that you're an idiot for dating this 14-year-old.

He's 20.

That means he was seven when Good Will Hunting came out.

Seven, Cece.

Good Will Hunting.

You know what? Let me go, let me go, let me go.

Um, check this out.

Cece's boyfriend is so young that It'll come back to me.

Buster is more of a man than all of you.

Okay? He's been to, like, 40 countries, he builds boats, he used to train snakes with his uncle.

Earning a respectable wage, wearing a proper-hanging pair of slacks, ordering sushi like a sick-ass boss - These things a man maketh.

So stupid stuff that you do.

I know that technically you guys are men, but all you do is hang out with each other, like you're 12.

What do you know? You're just a stupid girl.

Okay, I got it, I got it.

Okay, Cece's boyfriend is so young that - How-how young is he? - Winston.

It's not working, man.

I'm serious.

I'm at my wit's end with you.

What? Wait a minute.

Why's the door locked? The dance starts in five minutes.

Okay.

Gary! Thank God you're here.

Can you unlock the door? No.

I didn't put that there.

What? Who else could have done it? We can't start the dance if the door's locked.

Don't tell me I wore my raw denim for no reason.

Don't you dare tell me that! I am not telling you that.

So the dance is cancelled, then? No, no, no.

There is gonna be a dance.

It's gonna be great and perfect and lovely and it will celebrate love is forever and ever and ever.

Where are you guys going? In life, nowhere.

But I know I don't want to be here.

Guys, please stay.

It would really mean a lot to me.

Boring.

It's Jess.

All of her chaperones just bailed, and she needs help.

A lady needs help? Is that a job for a boy? - No.

Or a - Man! - man? Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Men! Well, the dummy patrol is ready.

Men! Men! Men! - Aah! Men.

Man! - So stupid.

Seriously, are you okay for real? - You got any ice? - Dude, rub his shoulder.

Rub his shoulder.

I'll get ice.

I'll get ice.

My shoulder go into his.

You all right? - Ow, man! - Okay, all right, just sit back.

Nick, get the ice! - How do you know how to do that? - Well, a tire iron is actually strong enough to break through a high-carbon steel steering wheel lock, so, you ow, I figured I'd work with this.

Cece scares me sometimes.

It's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend.

Got it.

There we go.

Oh! Yes! Everything's back on track, guys! This bike lock was a real punk move.

Seems like there's a lot of punks here.

Did you do this? - Hey.

You did this? Huh? You did this? - Hey, easy, easy.

If anyone's messing with this dance, it's one of those teachers Those hats were begging for payback.

Let's do this.

Hey.

Listen up, chaperones.

You will obey all of my instructions.

This means everything to Jess.

Your asses belong to me now.

Which means I currently have four asses.

The three of yours and mine.

I think we're capable of handling a bunch of prepubescent kids.

Do you think you are tough, Winston? You have no idea what these little bastards are capable of.

I mean, I love them.

I love them with all my heart.

But they will hurt your feelings sometimes.

He's right.

I remember sticks and stones may break your bones, but not if you're a fat kid with calcium deficiency.

Schmidt, you're on snack table duty.

Keep the chip bowls full.

Don't let the kids spike the punch.

And make sure Diabetic Amy only has four cookies.

Diabetic Amy ain't gonna get no cookies on my watch.

No, she-she has to have at least two or she'll pass out.

She's getting nothing as far as I'm concerned.

At least two, at least two or she'll pass out.

All right, Winston? Dance floor duty.

Yes, sir.

Ooh, you shouldn't have said that, man, that is the perfect place for me right now.

I got - so much heat coming off me, man.

No.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

No heat.

Ooh, ooh, ooh.

No heat.

Hey, hey, hey.

None.

Hey, look at me.

No heat.

The opposite of heat.

Six inches separation at all times.

Nobody's getting pregnant tonight.

That's the same thing I say on my dates.

Not cool.

Let's h*t it.

Hey, hey.


Saving the best for last?

Oh, I'm sorry, Nick, uh, you're not chaperone material.

I've been at this job for a few weeks now and I know the stink of a bad kid.

That makes me the perfect candidate to be a chaperone, Coach.

Just think about it.

I can get in the mind of a bad kid.

Think like 'em, go deep.

I can go too deep.

I'm gonna put you in the parking lot to sweep for stragglers.

You want me on the streets.

It's not that important of a job.

I won't let you down.

I'm not gonna let you down! You taking a a break right now? When the heat moves you, you got to move Okay, no heat.

No heat.

No heat, Bishop, no heat.

Keep that heat locked up.

Keep that heat Think you're going, baby I, this is Crazy.

Put that heat away, Bishop.

Huh? Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

You got that, man.

You got What are you looking at? Cool mustache.

Too much heat.

Too much heat.

All right, kids, let's use the serving tongs.

This isn't Appalachia.

Hurry up, everybody, before Justin eats everything.

Son, I don't think you meant to hurt Justin's feelings, there.

What's going on, really? Are the parents fighting at home? Leave me alone, flamer.

Flamer? You're the You're the flamer, pal.

You're the flamer.

You're the flamer.

Flamer.

Stop saying that word, it's probably - offensive to some people, you flamer.

Flamer, flamer.

Yeah, take a doughnut, there, you flamer.

Flamer.

Schmidt.

I got a bit of a situation here.

Um, thoughts? Advice? What now? Aw, son of a b penis.

Ah, that wasn't better.

Sorry, everyone.

You were right.

Someone's trying to mess with my dance.

Hmm.

It's paste.

And it's fresh.

Banana in the dark.

Uh-oh.

You ruined my dance.

I can smell the paste.

Perpetrator! He's in there.

Okay, when we get in there, I'm going to be good cop, you be bad cop, okay? Got it.

There are two ways this can go.

Number one: you tell us why you ruined the dance.

Number two: I bash your skull in with a carburetor! - I thought I was bad cop.

You are the bad cop.

I'm the tough, competent cop, who's good at her job, you're the kind of fumbly, dumb cop - who's nice and - Yeah, that's not how it works, though.

I mean, the good cop is nice and the bad cop is mean.

That would be nice cop, mean cop.

It's how it works - on every cop show, when you watch it.

I watch cop shows.

You need to pay more attention.

I do pay attention - What do you awful women want? - We want to know why you locked the door and poured glue in the breaker.

I didn't do any of that.

Why would anybody want to ruin such a magical night? Uh, you're the only one who wanted to have this stupid dance.

Revenge would be my guess.

What do you know? Well, you have the grip of a much taller woman.

And I don't not like that.

Ugh.

some fireworks or something.

What's up, gentlemen? Just hanging out outside in the parking lot? We're not doing anything.

We don't need a chaperone.

Calling me a 'rone? I'm not a 'rone.

I'm basically the same guy as you.

We're wearing the same shirt.

I'm a good guy, I'm having fun.

I'm just I'm bored in there, I'm looking to hang out.

Is that a crime, officers? Say, you guys got any Billy Whizz? Any juice, any sweet Mary Jane? I'm looking.

Okay, if you're really not a chaperone why don't you take a sip of this? Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

I got nothing to prove.

Are you a 'rone or not? Give me that.

What is that? Is that a su1c1de? - The soda flavors all mix together.

You know it, bro.

That was super intense.

Sorry, I spit some of it up.

He's cool.

Hey, buddy, uh, Tommy, is it? I just I just wanted to apologize for what happened before, kiddo.

What, are you gonna propose to me, now? That's funny.

No, I I get it.

You know, when I when I was young, I too found that humor can be a useful tool.

Dude, get up, I'm not gonna marry you.

I,, found that humor can be a a useful tool.

And then you grow up and you become a man.

Well, you smell like a woman.

That's it, enough is enough with you.

You think you're a tough guy, tough guy? Prove it, man.

Name the time and place.

Fist fight? - Foot race.

A what? - Yeah, you heard me foot race, man.

I'll run circles around you and all your pals.

Oh.

You girls are multiplying like bunnies.

That's weird.

Lot more of you than there is of me.

We should lock all the doors.

No one gets in, no one gets out.

The culprit's inside.

It's frickin' Gosford Park! You need to just calm down a little, Jess.

I can't calm down! I want this to be perfect.

I know, but it's too late for that, okay? There are kids doing their homework in there.

It's bleak.

I know after what happened with Nick you wanted this to go great, but it's not your fault that the dance got messed up, all right? You'll get 'em next time.

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh, that was a sugar rush, man.

That's a buzz in the brain! Ooh, ooh! You guys see how high I just got? I'm good.

He ain't a 'rone.

Too dumb.

Aw, this is fun, man! I miss this! I really do, man.

Let's keep going.

Let's get burgers.

Meet some girls.

Different ages, man.

It's so early! Hey, we got something to show you.

Look, guys, we had a lot of fun, but we can get in a lot of trouble for doing this.

Which is why you gotta run really fast when it goes off.

Like now! - Oh, dude! - Go! I mean it! Go! - Oh, my God! - Yeah! Yeah! What are we gonna do now? Let's ride.

Oh, hell yeah! Wendy? Busted.

Well, you really did come prepared, Wendy.

A wrench some glue a box of tampons? What were you gonna do with this? Um Oh.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

So you really didn't want the dance to happen? None of the boys want to dance with me.

Jess? Hey, Cece.

Hey.

This is Wendy.

She was just telling me how she doesn't like to dance with boys.

Oh.

Yeah.

Well that makes sense because boys are the dumbest.

You're just saying that.

No.

No, no.

No.

Cece and I have met so many boys, and they are all so dumb.

Yeah, and I've met more than her, so Yeah, and Cece has met more than me because she is nicer than me.

Nicer? - I just mean you've met 'cause you're well-traveled.

"Well-traveled" is how we're gonna say it? - I mean - You better tread lightly.

I will Travel You travel a lot.

Mm-hmm.

I don't think I'm ever gonna dance with a boy.

Listen, are boys dumb? Yes.

Yes! Do they do disappointing, stupid, stupid things that really hurt your feelings? Yes.

Sometimes things don't work out the way you plan them actually, they never work out the way you plan them but, in the end, it's all worth it, and that's why you have to try.

Are you talking about sex or dancing? - Dancing.

Dancing.

Oh, God.

Dancing, dancing.

We're talking about dancing.

Upright dancing.

Okay.

I'll try.

So let's get back out there.

Oh, Cece, it's okay.

There's no light, no music.

The dance is over.

Oh, no, this dance is not over.

We just need to find some stupid boys.

You look so slow.

Like a s like a s super dumb, slow turtle.

I'm so fast, and you're so old.

So much like a like a turtle, it's crazy to me.

Are we gonna do this or what? Oh, yeah, we're gonna do this.

I'm like a Hebrew cheetah.

On the count of three.

One two thr Flo-Jo! Flo-Jo! What are you doing? Hello?! Yeah! Yeah! Man! - What is your problem, man?! - I wasn't driving! Are you kidding me?! All students inside now! Go, go, go, go, go, go.

You three are the worst chaperones possible on earth.

A dog would be better than you.

A plant wearing underwear would be better than you.

Ray Charles' ghost would be better than you! Wh what kind of men are you? Hey! Stupid boys! We need ya.

Who's ready to have a good time? The lights went out, and you made your own light.

The music went out, and we're gonna make our own music.

We have a very special guest for you tonight.

Please give a big Coolidge Middle School welcome to the Dumbest Boys in School! I ought we were going with Sweet Surrender.

This won't be good.

Calm down, girls.

Don't get crazy.

Just calm down.

Okay, Coolidge, get ready to h*t the dance floor in three, two, one! Aw, yeah.

All right.

Rap battle.

8 Mile.

This one goes out to your vice principal, my friend, Jessica Day.

I don't wear indigo, I don't wear teal You better look out, you know that's right That's right 'cause 'cause Schmidt is for real, mmm I take that back, actually I do wear teal sometimes When I say "sometimes," you say "teal.

" Sometimes! - Teal! - Sometimes! - Teal! - Sometimes! - Teal! - Mic drop.

What's up, what's up, what's up? Anybody here from Chicago? Chicago, Illinois? City of Big Shoulders, Big Dreams! That would make sense.

You guys go to school here.

You're just kids, so you're all from here.

Somebody else, go.

That was it? Yeah.

Gonna be a cop, straight walking a b*at Role model, out on the street Unless I get assigned to a desk, which is also vital Because when paperwork slides, that's how you get a mistrial When I say "miss," you say "trial.

" - Miss.

Trial.

I said, when I say "miss," you say "trial.

" Miss, unless you trying to die.

What, are you nuts? Then know who you are.

A whole carton of dumbasses.

Ruin them khakis you got on.

Thank you all very much! Thank you! - I'm just saying, they're wearing light Hey, they're kids.

Good idea, Todd.

also got to die.

Ow! One, two, one, two.

Here we go.





(groans) (sighs) "You and Jess broke up." (sighs) Oh, man.

The bed got b*rned.

I thought it was a dream.

It was a not a dream.

I'm a little scared to see what's on the other side.
Writing left-handed is HARB.

(sighs) (spluttering) - Oh! - (shrieks) Goodness.

Hi.

Sorry.

I was just changing in the closet, like Superman.

Are we still allowed to see each other naked? - Yes.

Do you think so? I don't know.

Hmm.

Maybe.

Ah - Definitely not.

(goofily): "Derfi-niddley nit.

" (laughs) Boob season's over, for you.

Mind if I grab my socks? - Um, no.

You can go ahead.

I'll close my eyes.

Okay.

Hey! - Whoa! So how you doing? - I'm really good.

Good.

How 'bout you? - Great.

Yeah, I'm really enjoying the breakup.

Yeah.

I think I'm handling it well.

Yeah, you are.

You are.

You're.

You know, you're not drunk, you haven't left me And you're not crying while watching that movie Ghost.

Well, it's Dirty Dancing.

Doesn't Swayze do a dirty dance with that clay? That's not Dirty Dancing.

It's Ghost.

It's a different movie.

Which one takes place at camp? Dirty Dancing.

Which one's Whoopi in? Stop asking me questions about them.

Drop it.

(sniffs) So I saw this TV show about monkeys in India, and one of the monkeys, when it gets nervous and it wants to play submissive, it goes like this: And that lets all the other monkeys know it doesn't want trouble.

That's cool.

They also give each other oral pleasure.

And they masturbate.

So what do we do now, Jess? Well, normally, I would go home, but I already am home, so - (laughs) - can't do that.

I know where you live.

And I live where you live.

Should we tell the people we live with? - Yeah, let's do that.

Okay.

Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do What you gonna do when I come for you? Hey, you guys, we have, um Big news! I just got into the police academy.

(laughing) Police naw give me no break - Not a solider mona give you no break - You know it.

Coach: He knows it.

Because you are a cop.

No, my uncle was on Cops a bunch of times.

He got no residuals, though.

He's poor.

That really is big news! Big news.

What a happy, happy day! Huzzah! And to celebrate, I'm gonna have a banquet in my honor.

A banquet for yourself? That seems tacky.

Can anyone here think of any reason why today should not be all about me? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

So I guess we're not telling anyone today.

Nah, it doesn't seem like the right move.

Yeah.

So we have to pretend to be a couple for one more day.

It's not that big of a deal.

It's gonna be easy.

Yeah.

So we broke up.

What's the difference? Um I-I couldn't be more okay with it.

Well, I couldn't be more okay, either.

Great.

Me, too.

Capital "O," capital "K" capital "A," capital "Y.

" I'm okay.

(crying): I'm not okay, Mom.

(sniffling) I'm not okay.

I'm not okay.

I'm sorry to pull you out of your dance class.

Oh, the recital was today? I know we did the right thing, I just I feel like really upset, and Nick seems totally okay and I guess I just need someone to tell me it's gonna be fine.

(sobbing): It's not gonna be fine, Jess.

I'm never gonna be a grandmother! What? Mom Stop crying.

You don't even have to love him, honey.

You just have to get that sperm cooking! - Mom - I'm sorry, honey, I just You know, this is where I'm at right now.

Well, this was really comforting, Mom.

(Joan sobbing over phone) It's like I'm in the womb, sucking my thumb.

Look, of course she doesn't know I'm in pain, Tran.

I'm hiding it like you're supposed to.

But I'm lying to my best friend.

You're also my best friend, don't don't start that weird jazz train.

I don't know how I'm gonna hold it all together.

I can't talk about it with anyone all day.

I feel like a piÃ±ata, you know, and I'm just gonna pop.

What does that mean: "The problem is the solution?" Oh, you mean just focus myself on Winston, and I won't have time to think about Jess.

That's really smart, but that's not exactly "the problem is the solution.

" Do you know what I mean? That's, like, a cool sentence, but it's more just "stay busy," right? Thanks, Tran.

If I'd met you in your prime, during the w*r, that would have been glorious! But then we would've been enemies and tried to m*rder one another, unless we formed an alliance.

Oh You and me forming an alliance in an old-school w*r? That's a fantasy.

Or a novel.

You just gave me another idea.

Winston? I've been thinking about it, and a banquet is not big enough.

You're not retiring from some insurance company.

So what do you really want, besides a piÃ±ata? Dream big.

Dream big, he said.

Okay.

Um If I had my druthers you know, 100% of my druthers I I gotta go Honey Roast.

The hell is that? And don't say it like it's some thing we know! It's a roast, except you say nice things about me.

Honey Roast.

Huh.

You know? Well, I can't wait to make that happen for you.

You serious? - He thinks you're serious.

How do I do it? - You just get everybody to say a bunch of cute stuff about me.

You know, all the, like, funny stuff that makes me sweet, you know? Done! What else? What? There's There's more? (laughs) Uh make me a prominent chair.

Like a throne? - Come on.

A throne? Who am I, CeeLo? (laughs) No, I just This is me, I'm still the same person.

Stop touching me.

I'm not gonna change.

I'm still the same person.

Stop touching me.

So make me a prominent chair.

Then you shall have that, Winston.

What else you want? I'm thinking maybe you should MC my roast.

Okay, I will.

And can you do it dressed as Furguson? I'm not gonna do that.

Thought it might be special.

Nah, it's strange.

All right, I'm gonna get started on that chair.

Schmidt: Well, this just in: the dress code for Winston's banquet tonight is is opt is optional.

Why would he write "optional" there? That's gotta be a mistake, right? And they're gonna give him a g*n? What are you doing back there? Thought it was about time I graduated high school.

Mmm - I'm proud of you.

That's it? No snide comments? I've got legions.

But I'm gonna be supportive.

"Legions" means "a lot.

" I know what "legions" means.

Anyway, I probably won't even take the test.

I failed the last five practice exams.

So that seems like a bad sign.

Of course you're failing.

You're studying here in a rowdy tavern.

Chumbawamba's playing, it's not even "Tubthumping.

" You're writing with what looks to be a golf pencil.

Where are your flash cards? Do you not have o-one single flash card? There's maraschino goo everywhere! You don't have a flash card? I'm taking over.

You need a tutor.

Yes, I'll do it.

You realize I have a boyfriend, right? Oh, the hunky Australian boy? Congratulations.

Cece, this is about your education.

Nothing more.

Mm.

He's actually from Perth, so Perth is in Australia, Cece.

We'll start with geography.

Oh, Cece, I really need to ask Schmidt if my outfit's working.

It is not.

I was in the middle of tutoring Cece! - Make it quick! - I know why you're upset, okay? I should've asked you to tutor me.

But he just volunteered, and I figured you'd be busy with Nick.

Well, I'm not busy with Nick anymore.

Oh, no.

Did you guys break up? Jess, are you pregnant? I feel like I made it weird with the pregnancy thing, you guys.

Did I make it weird with the pregnancy thing? 'Cause I really feel like I did.

I feel like, in my heart, that that was a that was the wrong to say, especially to two women who are sitting alone in a room together.

You know, I don't know where you guys are at with your lives But you're certainly getting up to an age where babies are on your mind, and-and I didn't want to throw that into the mix.

I could see that you were emotional, Jess, when you left, and I, and I don't want to make you more emotional by bringing up pregnancy.

And, Cece, you can probably barely spell "pregnancy.

" And I feel terrible.

Are you frickin' razzing me in there? Did I just here a razz? Damn it! So you're really building Winston's throne, huh? It's a prominent chair.

And it's not right! It's not regal enough! - How long have you been doing this? - It's for the Honey Roast.

I'm trying to think of cute things to say about Winston.

I got great stuff about his feet.

What are you saying, dude? You sound insane.

If anything's cute about Winston, it's his yawn.

(yawning) He goes, like (both imitating Winston's yawn) - Can I use that? - You're scaring me, man.

Like, for real.

Like, I'm scared for you.

Don't do that voice 'cause it makes me confess things.

I'm really scared for you.

I broke up with Jess.

You broke - You broke up with Jess?! - (quietly): I broke up with Jess.

Aw, man.

It's real.

Or she broke up with me, I don't know, but we're broken up.

Well, at least that explains all of that.

Kind of.

I just feel like I'm falling apart.

Like, my brain feels like spaghetti.

And my future feels like a dark hole that I can't stop falling down.

You can't show her this pain.

Or she'll freak out and it'll be over, okay? I wish someone would've told me that when Malia and I broke up.

(crying): Malia, I'm in pain and I want you to know! (sobbing) I want to get this pain out of my body! (retching) I haven't seen her since.

I still read her e-mails, though.

Every day.

Every day.

Every damn day.

Every day.

You have to hide your feelings no matter what.

And I am.

She thinks I'm okay.

That's my game plan.

I'm talking about pills, man.

Schmidt's got some anxiety pills in his top drawer, you know? - That's a great idea.

Do it.

Don't tell any of the roommates about the breakup.

Thought I made it clear that I do not want to talk about this.

Sure.

He just seemed so fine with it.

Like he's happier than me watching Coach watching Winston yawn.

(yawning) I'm sure he's just as sad as you are.

It's an act.

You need to go and talk to him so he can tell you how he really feels.

I'll go with you, okay? - Thanks.

Of course.

Are you guys Frenching? Okay, say you're Frenching and I'll stop knocking.

Ignore him, okay? Just ignore him.

Remember Cece, no one knows we broke up.

Not a word.

Nope.

Hey! - Come here, you.

Why are we doing this? Uh this is, uh, how I, how I greet everyone now.

And then I, uh, do this.

Then do that.

Oh.

And top it off with a little bit of that.

You feel me? This is how you greet everybody now? Ah, come here, you.

Uh, that wasn't an invitation.

Nick, hi! Son of a bitch! Come here, you.

What are you doing, man? - You take the pills? - Uh, I feel as if I'm of cotton.

Sorry for what's about to happen.

(grunts) (whispers a blessing) Do you have a minute to maybe have a conversation with your sweet, sweet girlfriend? I think the only way we're gonna get through this is if we're really honest with each other about how we're really feeling.


This morning I told you I was okay, and Why are you winking at me? - Am I winking? - Yeah.

I think I'm just a little nervous.

I'm gonna put my sunglasses on so we can keep talking.

Okay, okay.

'Cause I don't think I can stop this.

Please continue with what you were saying.

Um, I just, um, want you to tell me how you really feel.

Great.

Gre I'm sorry, "Great"? - I feel great.

Is great the, the, uh, is the emotion you feel right now? - No.

Oh.

I feel amazing.

(laughs) - "Amazing"? - Yeah.

You feel amazing right now? I just feel happier and amazing and lighter.

Tonight's about Winston.

You don't have to worry about me 'cause I'm worried about the Honey Roast.

I'm sorry I forgot that Winston is the most important thing that's going on today.

That's where I'm putting all my energies.

Fan tastic.

Took a long time to say that word.

There you are! (groans) - We're supposed to be studying.

Come here, you.

Ah, thanks, Coach.

I needed this.

Mm.

Delightful.

To you, too, my friend.

That is super weird.

What is wrong with you? What are you scared of a couple practice tests? Just something more important came up, that's all.

There should be nothing more important to you, Cece, than your future.

Because nothing is more important to me than your future.

Do you know how stupid it makes me feel to care more about your future than you do? Nick and Jess broke up.

(Coach laughs) I knew you knew! - Oh! - I knew it! So, you knew, too.

But you knew and you told.

Look, that was so sweet of you, Schmidt.

Okay? And thank you for believing in me - Who gives a rat's A?! - Hmm? Nick and Jess break up.

and you spring this on me like a, like it's a freaking weather report? I am a child of divorce! I'm delicate! Should've graduated the first time around, you buffoon! Better keep it together, dude.

No one can know you know.

Jess: Guess what, Cece? (door closes) My boyfriend Nick is totally frickin' fine.

He's actually, he's "amazing.

" Okay, wine.

Yeah, make it a big one.

A holiday pour.

'Cause today's all about Winston.

Nick: Yeah, it's all about Winston.

Somebody say Winston? - Whoa! - What? Guys, I gotta say, I am walking on air, I really am.

It's, uh Excuse me for a second.

Hey, Winston! Hey, it's your day! I'm diving in! What can I do? 'Cause today is all about Winston.

Yeah, all about Winston.

Whatever you want, buddy.

Mm-hmm.

Anything? My name is Nick Miller and I'm your host of tonight's Honey Roast.

Winston: Thank you! Thank you! And I'm Furguson the cat.

Ya-ya! Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast, we're gonna keep it sweet, keep it positive, and most of all, we're gonna keep it cute.

Am I right, Furguson? Hope that cat's not driving.

How is a cat costume just lying around? She has four of them.

I'm drinking a "Catbernet.

" - (laughs) - That's pretty good.

Okay.

That's pretty good.

A Pinot "meowoir" Meow-oi-rr.

If I have one more of these, you're gonna have to point this old kitty in the direction of my litter box because I'm gonna need to find it.

Mm, let's keep it cute, guys.

'Cause I'm gonna have to pee.

Speaking of cute, Winston Bishop is so cute All: How cute is he? How cute am I? Teddy bears buy Winston for their kids.

That was good.

That is exactly how cute I am.

Horrible visual.

Want to know how cute you are? Yeah, I want to know how cute I am.

You want to know how cute you are? I want to know how cute I am.

Puppys put him Not gonna do that one.

Are we still pretending that we don't - Relax.

Keep it together.

Mm-hmm, it'll be over soon.

Pretend like you're enjoying this.

Smile.

Mm-hmm.

Winston is so cute, he once met a Japanese gal named Ariko, and she started wearing him as a backpack! (both laugh) Boom! Ooh! I did not see that one coming! Oh, my! - I didn't expect it either.

Surprise ending! I think it's time, I think it's time that this cat takes over.

Why hold back? I feel like we should make this - a real roast.

Yeah.

Don't do that.

Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

I'm kind of scared, but I'm also kind of excited.

I think, actually, it's my turn to - It's my turn! - Uh mm-mm.

Okay, back here.

This is the best idea.

I think I should sit down.

Getting a little mean.

(laughs) Time to add some honey.

Who's in the house? Coach is in the house.

What-what? What's up, Coach? You have so many sweatpants, you need to buy normal pants.

(laughs) Cece here.

You guys know Cece.

Your hair's so long.

Well, you're basically busted.

Good one.

That was good.

That was really a good one.

That was a good one.

Schmidt - Jess, please, don't.

I'm very fragile right now.

Your head's so big.

(laughing) That actually wasn't that bad.

You got a big-ass head, dude! And Nick Miller Oh, boy.

What can I say about Nick that hasn't already been said? Oh, here we go.

Nick calls birds "wind mice.

" Nick: Think about it.

Nick says "Yahtzee" when he climaxes.

Oh, boy.

He calls turtles "shell beavers.

" Well, that's what they should be called.

Jess: They're green.

Beavers are brown.

We've had this argument and we have agreed to not talk about it in front of others.

But you know the worst, worst, worst thing about Nick? - You don't have to say it.

You just - Mm-mm, mm-mm.

He's okay.

He's okay.

And I am not okay.

(sniffles) I'm not okay.

What are you talking about? Are you nuts? I'm falling apart.

Yeah, I I'm on Schmidt's anti-anxiety medicine.

What?! (laughs) Nick: Yeah, I stole it from his drawer.

Schmidty's little helpers.

Ooh.

Sorry about that.

I'm very much not okay! I was only acting okay 'cause I thought you were okay.

I'm not okay.

I am not okay.

I'm terrible! I know I'm smiling right now, but I feel terrible.

I'm so happy - Yeah.

that you feel terrible.

It's a devastating breakup.

You know, I know we lived together.

It's really hard.

It's tricky, you know? - Yeah.

You know, it sucks.

I really thought we had a future.

Me, too.

Yeah, saw the whole thing, the whole thing.

And now we don't.

It's done, yeah.

We have nothing in common.

(laughs) Yeah.

I also can't stop smiling because of the drugs, so my face feels crazy.

It feels like I had plastic surgery.

Winston: Can somebody please tell me what the hell is going on in here? - You want to do this? - I think we should.

Both: We broke up! - We're done.

It's over.

It's all done.

Are you serious?! What?! - What?! No! Come on, guys, it's so obvious.

Son of a bee sting.

I mean What, you broke up today? - Yesterday.

Yesterday.

Well, why didn't you tell me? Because we didn't want to ruin your day.

And I'm so sorry we did.

We're so proud of you that you got into the police academy, but we're just, we're in a really bad zone.

Yeah, a too bad zone.

So let's just come out and admit it.

We're in a terrible zone.

Are you kidding me? Something this big happens and you guys still look out for me? I mean, that's Thank you.

I really appreciate it, you guys, but I'm here for whatever you need.

Thank you, buddy.

Look, I know this is super weird and definitely high on anxiety pills but I'd like everybody to hold hands in this moment.

No.

Just do it, man.

That's it.

Everybody? - Oh.

It's two ladies.

I'm okay.

This feels good.

Om (all humming) (humming stops) Let's never tell anyone we did this.

Should we all try to live inside a peach, or is that weird? Guys, in light of what's been going on, I will be postponing the Honey Roast - until tomorrow night.

Okay.

Ah! - No.

Coach: No way.

Schmidt: Not doing this.

We could say everybody come back, - Sorry, Winston.

everybody come back the same time, so then you guys all get to wear white.

Hungry eyes (phone ringing) One look at you And I can't disguise I've got hungry eyes Hi, again.

I feel the magic (mutes audio) I'm watching Dirty Dancing.

I know.

I've heard all three screenings.

I just don't understand how Penny got in trouble.

Well, you know, it was a different time.

Who wins in a fight? Swayze from Dirty Dancing or Swayze from Roadhouse? I think, uh, To Wong Foo Swayze would win.

Jess, this is really hard.

I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to call you.

It's like a riddle.

I know! I don't know where to change or where to sleep or where to go to the bathroom.

Well, I know where to go to the bathroom.

But you know, the social component.

(sniffles) (chuckles) Oh, no.

I'm out of tissues.

Nick: I got it.

Heads up! Oh! Hey.

Thank you.

Nick: No problem.

That's what I'm here for.

Good night, honey.

Good night.

With these (sings along): Hungry eyes One look at you and I can't disguise (Nick joins in): guise, I got hungry eyes





We're all adults.

What's the harm? We can do this with dignity, self-restraint, and dare I say - honour.

The game is True American.

One, two, three, four JFK! FDR! Sorry.

Welcome to Ellis Island, folks.

You're a Bill, - Ah! you're a George, - you're a Bill.

Ah.

You're Greek.

Get out of here! What? Why am I Greek? You're a Greek.

Get out of here! - Get out of here.

And you - (moans) - He's got the plague! Scatter! Hello! (all shouting) Taft just sat on you! My name is Eli Whitney, and I created the cotton gin.

Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! - Gin! Gin! Gin! - (gags) (snoring) Oh, God.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

(groans) Son of a - (moans) (slurred): Jessica, did we die? No.

Alive.

Shh Turkey bacon.

Mm.

That's nice.

(slurred): That's ni, Nick.

That's ni.

Get sleep.

(moans) - (speaking incoherently) - Yeah.

(smacking lips) Help me up.

I'm trying.

You're (mumbling) You drink some water.

Aw, son of a bitch, the water fell on the ground.

(groans) Here.

Here you go.

Drink the water.

That's good.

(sucking) (phone ringing) Oh, no.

No.

Oh, make it stop.

Jessica, make it stop.

No! (groans) Oh.

(moans) Hello.

Jess, where are you? It's Jacob's first birthday.

You're his godmother, I need you here.

Sir, hi.

Who are you? This is a private residence.

I'll be right there.

(groans, exhales) (hoarsely): Hey, Nick.

It's me, Jess.

I have really bad news.

We have to go to a one-year-old's birthday party.

I'm not interested in that birthday party.

Thank you for the invitation.

Good night.

(groans) (groans) I'm so hungover.

Why today? - What? You think it went bad? We're your new neighbors.

Um, I think y-your bagel fell out of your mouth.

I'm Jewish.

Why didn't you guys tell me I was still wearing ladies' sunglasses? I look like Magic Johnson's son, EJ.

Hey, you guys, I got a problem.

You know that guy that I'm dating? Buster, your child bride? He's 20, okay? Not that it matters.

Is he smooth all over? Does he take baths in the sink? I sent him a bunch of drunk texts last night.

What? - Mmm.

(sighs) Oh, dear Lord.

I know.

"I miss the way that your hands smell"? Did you write an entire Jewel song in here? Is it from Pieces of You? You want to buy a rabbit with him? This isn't a text message, it's a freaking Russian novel.

Okay, well, you know what, what do I do? Text him one of the little yellow men.

The-the emoticons.

You know, with the with the fa with the faces.

I hate all of you.

Okay, so we really t*nk it with those babes.

Look, we need to orchestrate a situation which allows us to put our best foot forward.

That's easy.

We help 'em move.

Winston, Winston shh.

Why? It makes perfect sense.

Helping a girl move makes you come off as a doormat, you know what I mean? Honey, honey, honey, just listen to Coach.

Baby, look, let us handle this, okay? You go help Cece with the text messages.

You know, maybe I will.

Okay.

But only because I really do enjoy helping people.

You're gonna be great, buddy.

You're gonna do good things, man.

You think we were too harsh on him? He makes you.

He does.

Don't blame yourself.

(groans) How the hell did this happen? (Jess groans) I found some things and I put them on.

(groans) Throw this on.

Mm.

Okay.

That'll do it.

Cover up the tops.

You look great.

(crying) - No.

I couldn't have done it without you.

No, you're you're getting emotional.

You do this when you're hungover, but I'm gonna need you to stay focused so we can get to that party.

Yeah.

We just need the gift.

Yeah.

I got the gift.

All right.

Why is it in the box? It's supposed to be out of the box, assembled.

I said I would put it together before the party, and it's before the party.

So what's the problem? Just give me five minutes.

(pieces clatter) Ten minutes, tops.

But I got this thing.

This is it.

Christmas morning.

Our little guy waiting by the fireplace, but there's no gift.

'Cause Daddy's in the other room putting it together.

Did you say "our" kid? Yeah, sometimes I think about what our kid would be like.

(sniffles) Don't you? Yeah.

You don't think about the future? Can we not talk about this right now? Six hours ago, I was lapping cognac out of Winston's hands.

Drink it up, Checkers.

Forget what you saw.

Never talk about anything serious when you're hungover, Jess.

I don't even really think about it that much.

I just think about, you know, passing things.

Just Nothing specific.

We live in a house by a lake.

That sounds pretty specific.

We live in a town with a sense of history but not so much history that the locals are suspicious of new people.

Two small children who are so incredibly creative they named themselves.

We don't need to discipline the kids 'cause they're so afraid of disappointing us.

Our house smells like cider.

And if there's a horse out back, you're not gonna get any guff from me.

Anyway, that's where I'm at.

(scoffs) What are you what are you thinking? What, um Where do you picture us? Where do you Nick.

Nick.

Mmm, mmm.

Oh, God.

I still feel like crap.

Guys, will you, um, look at this follow-up text that I'm sending to Buster? - It's for the little boy? - Try to be helpful, okay? - What are we looking at here? - Are those nursing cats? Winston said it was funny.

It's not.

It's incoherent.

No.

It's borderline p*rn.

(sighs) Wait, those are not cats.

That's a human man! What is he suck What is he sucking on? - What Web sites are you going to? - What are you guys doing out here? Obviously we're creating an accidental bump-in with our hot new neighbors.

Elevator's on the move.

You got to go.

You're too hot.

You'll confuse them.

(groans) (elevator dings) Yes, well, of course.

It's my garden party, and Zachary Quinto is not on the list.

Um, you sure you can handle that, Winston? - I'm fine.

I'm fine.

Ooh.

Are you sure? Winston: I'm fine.

I'm fine.

To the right a little bit.

Up right.

Son of a bitch.

Okay.

Thank you so much.

We'll get you some nice cold lemonade after this, okay? Ooh, be careful.

Oh! Good Lord.

You know what, we don't have to talk about the future.

Let's just put this toy together.

I want to talk about the future.

Okay.

Great.

All right.

I would love to talk about it.

Yes, great.

I always thought it would be cool to be a long-haul trucker.

You want to be a long-haul trucker with a family? No, the family would be in Montana.

Or-or Mars Landing, you know, if the government finally steps up.

Where is Mars Landing? Where is Mars Landing? It's on M It's on Mars.

It's the American capital of Mars.

And if you don't think there's gonna be space travel in the next 20 years, then you've got your head buried in sand, girlie.

It's already basically happening.

I always thought I'd move back to Portland.

Oh.

Portland, Earth? It's like friendly San Francisco.

Slow food, fast bicycles, great schools Education is very important to me.

That makes me happy.

It's something we agree on.

I really want my kids to beg for it.

What? 'Cause if you force a kid into school, he's gonna hate it.

Oh, no.

If you make a kid work and sit in the yard and grind and grind - and grind - What? eventually, that little kid is gonna beg for education.

Then you hand it to them - like the gift that it should be.

No! That's why public school's a joke.

I'm so hungover and my body's shutting down and nothing you're saying makes any sense.

There is something serious I have to tell you about the future.

The name of my firstborn child has to be Reginald VelJohnson.

I lost a bet to Schmidt.

Reginald VelJohnson? That is non-negotiable.

Unfortunately.

The dad from Family Matters? Well, the actor who plays the dad.

The dad is Carl Winslow.

What was the bet on? I said I could flip a big pancake (laughing): and I couldn't.

(muffled): How is this going to work?! The only upside is the original name was gonna be Ass Baby, and I kind of talked my way out of that one.

All of the guys in this building are so sweet.

It's no problem, yeah.

Couldn't be easier, really.

Just a p piece of cake.

Coach: We love it.

You know, it was my idea to help move.

The only reason we're doing this is because you forced us to.

If we don't help now, we'll look bad.

Yeah, now they're gonna think of us as "nice" and "helpful.

" Nightmare.

Hey.

Hey.

Coach: Oh, cool! Uh your brother? Actually, it's my boyfriend.

Yet he's not here to help you move.

He's out of the country.

Oh! Afghanistan.

Second tour.

Ah - Oh Please thank him for, - uh, for his service.

Yeah.

Are you and your boyfriend and Michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a, like, double date kind of thing whenever he gets back from Afghanistan? She doesn't have a boyfriend.

She's not really the relationship type.

Oh.

Okay.

I'm just having fun right now.

I feel you.

No, I feel you.

(laughs) Girl, I want to feel you And then there was one.

May the best man win.

I am also involved in this.

Winston, get out of here.


What is your problem? And then there were three guys Jess: Here's what I'm saying: Reginald is way too shy to beg for an education.

He's very sensitive, and when he's out on the horse, all he's doing is staring at leaves and writing poems about them.

Why do I have a horse? You know how many people are k*lled on a horse every year? Hey! You're not listening to what I'm saying.

What I'm saying is, I'm not gonna take Reginald out on the damn lake when you're out on your space truck - We're not living by the lake.

(exasperated sigh) Why would I spend my hard-earned truck driver money on an Earth house? - You make up so much science fiction - Science but you know nothing about science.

Do you know what science is? - Okay, science is more of a belief - than anything else.

No.

Do you know what science is? - Yes.

What you believe in.

Have you ever taken a science class? I've taught two at a community college.

When did you teach science at a community college? I made that up.

I didn't think you were gonna fact-check me.

My kids are not gonna beg for an education, okay? They're gonna be forced to go to school just like everybody else and they're gonna hate it! Can I actually be very real with you for a second? - Yes.

Here's what I really believe: You can create a plan for your life, and then crazy things get thrown at you, and that, by the way, is the closest thing that I have to a plan.

So maybe it's crazy to talk about being an intergalactic truck driver.

But what I think is crazier is trying to plan every single detail of our future.

I think it's crazy not to.

I just can't - live that way.

I guess we just disagree.

Well, we never agree on anything, ever, Nick.

Why are we doing this right now, Jess? We're hungover.

Just because I want to know we're going in the same direction, - that we're on the same page.

Yes, we are.

Well, we live on different planets! Oh You're talking about the fake future! I just I guess we want different things.

Clearly, we do.

Clearly, we do.

All right, so what are you saying? Should we just break up? (both laughing) Yeah, right.

Like we're just - gonna break up! - Just break up! Over what? You don't like lakes, I don't like space.

That's okay! This is not why people break up! I break up with thee, sir! (bad Australian accent): I break up I don't do voices.

I think I'm still drunk.

(laughs) Let's just get to the party.

Build this toy and go.

Yeah.

Let's do it.

We are an unstoppable toy-building team! Yes, we are.

Yeah.

All right, well, first hurdle: the instructions are written upside-down.

Ah, it's a false alarm.

Okay, h*t me.

What do you got? Okay, take the thing - that looks like a meth lab - This thing? and put it in the thing that looks like a pipe b*mb.

Oh, hey! - Hey! Now we're cooking with gas.

We're a good team.

I agree.

You know what, Jess and if you want to move to Portland in the future, then we're gonna move to Portland.

You know, we'll live by the lake.

I'll learn to fish, and me and Reginald will start a newsletter, you know "Lake Father, Lake Son.

" And you know what? If you want to be a long-haul trucker, I can deal with that for six months, tops.

Yes! - Um, this piece is a little sticky, - but I think I can just jam it.

Ah! - What did you just do, Jess? - Oh.

Well, I put the swastika in the guillotine.

How is this a children's toy? Why is it so brittle? What is that? I'm not sure what I've been doing.

(sighs) Hey, Michelle.

Hey.

You guys are lifesavers.

You have beautiful taste, by the way.

Really.

Is this early Californian? You know, this color, actually, it symbolizes a woman's fertility.

Huh.

I was pregnant once.

Cool.

What-what do you know? - Yeah.

Thank you, guys.

No, thank you.

So much.

You bet.

All right.

Talk to you la - You see her blink at me? Wait, you think that was a sex blink? That wasn't a sex blink.

That was definitely a sex blink, dude.

You would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex.

What? - It's over already, man.

You don't have a sh*t.

'Cause the chicks you pull are gremlins.

You did not just talk about my chicks.

My chicks look great.

Just like me.

I'm saying my chicks - literally look just like me.

All of 'em.

In varying color, but they look like me.

That is super awkward, and I don't feel like you know what - you're saying right now.

Whoops! Oh Coach! Oh, man, I can't believe you just did that to her vase.

Whoa! Dude! I will knock you out where you stand, and you in the ground.

I will pound you from the side! I will pound you from the back! That sounded weird.

Once again, Schmidt has found himself in a position where he is infuriated! I will fight your face! I will freak out so hard on you right now, you don't even know, on your face.

Winston: What are you two Oh, my goodness.

Guys! Her study-abroad mirror? Her dream vase? Come on, guys.

(huffs) Have some self-respect.

We're Nick: Hey, Jess? I don't think that belongs there.

That's why it doesn't fit in.

Well, I don't think this water bottle goes here, either.

But you put it there.

Well, why did we take the toy out of the box? We could have just given the box to the kid.

What does he know? He's one.

He eats pennies.

And he poos in his pants.

Because not putting the toy together is lazy.

So, if we can't put the toy together - I-I know, but it's not gonna fit.

You can't just keep pushing it because it Oh, God.

Okay, where's the tape? - Oh, we used all the tape.

Oh, you used all the tape.

Yeah, to fix the things that you broke.

You used a lot of duct tape.

Actually you broke a lot of pieces.

(laughs) All right, give it to me.

I'm gonna use a lighter.

And I'm gonna melt the plastic.

I'm gonna weld it together.

What? You don't think that's a good idea? No, you should, I think you should try it.

I also like doing Zippo tricks.

Ow! Aah, I b*rned my finger! - What happened?! Are you okay? Yeah, it's fine.

My skin's a little bubbly.

Well, I knew that was a bad idea.

Then why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago? Because I'm not Santa Claus! I don't just put toys together two weeks in advance! And also, it's none of my business what they want to do with the toy.

Maybe they want to return it.

Maybe they want to put it together as a family.

That is not my business.

What do you want from me, Jess? I just want you to take a little more responsibility.

Just a little bit more.

And I want you to have a little faith in me! I've gotten this far in my life.

And I'm doing just fine.

I mean, for the most part.

There's definitely a few blunders here and there that we could look past.

Whatever The blanket's on f*re! I can see that, Jess.

Go get a bucket.

Where is it? In the kitchen? No, that's for meat.

We need a different bucket.

Oh, right! The famous meat bucket! You said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea! Why would I think an unrefrigerated bucket of meat was a good idea?! To taste what meat tasted like before electricity! Why would you want that?! Why did you say it was brilliant!? Because, Nick if I was always honest with you then we would never stop fighting.

(smoke alarm beeping) - Let's go! - We have to go! Wait, my hat! What? My hat.

So sorry.

I'm sorry.

So sorry.

Sorry.

It was uncool.

I'm so sorry! Do you need? Here, do you want? Oh.

How did this happen? - It was Winston's fault.

He just ca he carries things wrong.

What?! I have heard just about enough from you two.

What? Ow! Schmidt: Winston! Girls, I know you're both smart enough to know exactly who broke your things.

It's the same two clowns who've been trying to sex Michelle every which way from Tuesday.

I mean, I ain't gonna lie.

I've been trying to sex you every which way from Tuesday myself.

I'd be crazy not to, Michelle.

You're a very beautiful woman.

You have crazy witch eyes, and I dig it.

You're like a witch! (laughs) You know.

But I'm a good guy.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.

My name is Winston Bishop.

Welcome to the building.

Whoa, Winston, I would not that's a - Winston, what are you doing? - That's a big (roars) - Okay.

Aah! - Oh! Whoa! - Son of a Winston, you do know that the building's on f*re, right? I got this! Move, move! Buster: Cece, hey.

Oh, hey, um, I didn't think you would pick up the phone.

I'll-I'll make this quick.

'Cause I'm sure you hate talking on the phone.

Oh, I actually do.

'Cause I'd much rather, um, talk in person.

You know? Face to face? (laughs) What are you doing here? I just, I was, uh, walking over here to see you.

Mm-hmm.

And then you called me.

Didn't all those texts really freak you out? Oh, no, no, no, no.

They freaked me out.

I thought you were gonna m*rder me.

You know, I called my mother, changed my locks.

Then I kind of, you know, had a change of heart, and I thought, "Well, you know, I like this girl.

" I'd much rather just come and look at you with my eyes.

And talk to you with my face.

If you ever got off the damn phone.

Yeah.

Right? - I, mm-hmm.

I understand.

Hi, Cece.

How are you? - Hungover? - Yes.

Would you like to come and get some pancakes? Yeah, I could, I could use some pancakes.

It's gonna be a bouncy ride.

My kangaroo's around the corner.

(laughs) But I did bring an extra helmet.

You're lucky.

(grunts) All right.

Nick, why is this so hard? I don't want to fight all the time.

I don't know, and it's awful.

Do you ever miss when we were just friends, Jess? And there wasn't this pressure to be together and to be - Be different people? - Yes.

Be different people.

I'm sorry, but I'm not that guy who's gonna put the toy together.

That's just not me.

I'm the kind of guy who's gonna leave it in the box.

I don't want you to be that guy.

I-I want you to be yourself.

I want you to be yourself.

Are we? (laughs): No! I love you! - Well, I love you, too.

More than I've ever loved anybody.

But what if that's the only thing we have in common? (sniffs) I miss my friend.

I really miss my friend, too.

So, what does that mean? Are we? Yeah.

(quiet laugh) (quietly): Earn this.

Was that Saving Private Ryan? It was.

It was a hu-huge moment in that movie.

And I just, I know this is a moment.

(both laugh) So, um, I'll walk you to your room then, I guess.

(sniffs) (sniffs) - Schmidt is living in my room.

Schmidt's in your room, yeah.

Yeah.

Do you think I could? - Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's cool.

(door shuts) Jess? Jess, you didn't have to run away.

I don't know what you're so afraid of.

It's just a man doing full downward facing dog in the nude.

It's a couple of testicles just hanging upside down.

(quiet laugh) I can hear you laughing in there.

Yeah, you liked it.

You telling Nick about it? What's he saying?
