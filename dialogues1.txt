You taking up tennis? No, it's fly swatter.

I want to see it work.

Well, we need a fly.

I've been waiting whole morning.

Did you honestly just k*ll one? Hey, what's going on, guys? Ooh! Ah! Walk with dignity, you giant toddler.

Come on, Schmidt, you got to get this stuff out of here, man.

Yeah, well, I can't afford storage.

All my money's tied up in the storefront I leased for Jess' sister.

So why don't you put your junk in the storefront, Schmidt? You really want me to put an Ian Schrager rug in a room without climate control? What? Oh, he was the guy in Star Wars.

Medium talent.

Hey, guys.

Morning.

Hey, Jess.

Hey.

Come on, Coach! Let's hustle! I got Coach a job at the school, and it's his first day.

I don't like kids, I don't like teaching, I just like paychecks.

Well, I think you're gonna love it.

I don't think I'm gonna love it.

Run! Do not stop running or I will eat your faces and bodies! Keep running or I will m*rder your family! I love this job.

You're pissing me off! This one.

This one.

I got my eye on you.

Thanks for helping me move my stuff, you guys.

Lots of hairy boxes God, I've fallen.

Almost below you now, Nick.

Fellow passengers, stuck in the caboose of life.

You think I'm in the caboose of life? You love it in the caboose, not me.

It hurts.

It's actually quite jarring.

Loves it in the caboose - I don't love it in the caboose.

Yes, he does.

Uh, hi.

Are you guys open? Oh, this actually It's not a store.

Oh.

That's too bad.

I really like that lamp.

You like You like the lamp? I'm sorry.

He's lovely, isn't he? Pl-please look around.

Feel free.

The lamp is 100% full price.

Uh, pretty much everything's What you're doing is illegal.

You can't say this is a store.

I'm not taking advice from you.

You pronounce the "G" in "lasagna.

" Lasag-na.

Oh, my God.

I think my arm's broken.

I'm gonna sue the crap out of you.

Winston! Quiet.

So, I have Jamal Chambers in my fourth period, and he cannot stop talking about how fun and enthusiastic his new volleyball coach was.

You were right.

I love this job.

I knew it.

I knew you'd love it.

Hey.

I was looking for you.

You weren't in my car.

Internet's down.

Okay, um, well, I rebooted the router.

You're actually on the wrong IP address, so There you go.

Ooh.

You know I can see everything that you search for, right? I'm a biology teacher.

It's all research.

Fixing computers and stuff now? I'm just taking on a little extra responsibility around here, just getting stuff done that needs doing.

Graffiti's wrong, kids.

Don't do it.

I love corn on the cob, too, but I'm not gonna paint it all over the walls.

I'm just hoping, you know, in a few years I'll have enough experience that Dr.

Foster will consider me for vice principal.

Why don't you just ask him for it? You can't just ask for a promotion.

You know.

You have to earn the promotion with years of good work.

What's funny? Uh, how's that working out for you, Jess? Do you see this volleyball? It won't get over the net just because you want it to and you hope someone will notice that you want it to.

Okay.

I'm gonna ask you one more time: What do you want? Um, I want to be vice principal.

All right.

Then spike that ball, Jess.

Oh, that's not Okay, um - You got to spike! You got to spike! - Is that really Yeah.

Okay.

No, wait.

I'm not very good - Spike it! I've just never really been good with athlete b*lls.

Spike it! What do you want?! - I want to be vice principal.

Spike the ball and tell me what you want! I want to be the vice principal! - Yeah! - Yeah! Oh! Oh Oh! Oh I will not laugh.

An outrage! Been all over and I can't afford anybody.

Unbelievable.

Access to premium legal counsel should be every Jew's birthright.

And the jury will see that there is no justice for the Hebrew man.

Not in these so-called United States.

What is that that you're doing? I can't get enough of this legal drama.

Check this out.

Favorite author, Grisham.

Favorite TV show, Judging Amy.

Favorite color, courtroom brown.

Courtroom Brown.

Damn, I wish that was my nickname.

Did you just think of that? 'Cause it was perfect, man.

Courtroom Brown.

Dude, you're a born Courtroom Brown.

That's me.

When you say "Courtroom Brown," I respond.

Hey, Winston.

Hey, Courtroom Brown.

Yes? k*ll 'em, Courtroom! That's awesome! What am I supposed to do in this situation, represent myself like some nut job? Nick could be your lawyer.

This Nick? Vivica A.

Dropout? First of all, I don't want to be involved, but thank you, Courtroom Brown.

And second of all, I passed the bar, which means I can practice in the state of California.

Oh, Nick, you would be the worst in the whole entire world.

No offense.

I love you, dawg.

I could be your lawyer easy.

You don't forget how to be a lawyer.

It's like riding a bike.

They've changed these! Fine.

I forgot how to ride a bike.

But I'm not gonna forget how to be a lawyer.

I guess I have no choice.

You can be my lawyer, Nick.

I won't do it.

What? I value myself too great for that.

If you want me to be your lawyer, if you want to win this case, you must start with the word "please.

" And I'll need a symbolic five-dollar retainer.

Four dollars.

Skin it.

Let's do it.

Hooah.

Dr.

Foster, I am young, I'm energetic and I think it's about time you take advantage of me! Well, this is a little awkward.

I'm, uh I'm exclusively into Asian women.

It's really a Kristi Yamaguchi thing.

After Lillehammer - I really meant professionally.

I want you to take advantage of me like that.

Sorry.

It's a professional thing.

Okay.

Sorry.

I want to be vice principal.

Frank retired, you need someone.

I deserve it.

I bust my ass for this school.

You've got it.

The job is yours.

It is? - Oh, my God, are you kidding? I thought I was gonna have to force somebody into it.

This is so much easier.

Really? - Go ahead.

Be vice principal.

I can't believe this.

In fact, I think you should start right now.

You will not be sorry, sir.

Did you? - I got the job! Yeah! - Oh! - I spiked the ball.

Time to celebrate.

No! No! I'm not doing that! - No! - We got to celebrate! Celebrate! Let me pour it on your face and your clothes and your hair! Yeah.

Uh looks standard.

Yeah.

You're definitely being sued.

Uh, your deposition is tomorrow.

What-what do we do now? Do we prep for the plaintiff? I don't like prepping.

It makes me feel nervous.

I feel boxed in.

And I'm very quick - on my, uh - Sure.

Did you just forget the word "feet"? Feet.

Yeah.

Nick, you should really prep.

Fair enough.

Winston, you're my plaintiff.

Done deal.

Okay.

Hi, my name is Tim Baker.

I live at 522 Dugan Court Terrace.

Okay, Mr.

Baker, how long have you been a chef? I don't have to answer that.

You actually do though, Winston.

Doesn't he? You ask Why you asking me, man? - No, I'm not.

I'm Yeah.

You're the lawyer.

No, I know.

You have to answer.

How long you been a chef? I already answered that during background.

What in the hell? You did background without me? Why wasn't I invited for background? You have to answer it! How long you been a chef?! You're fired! Give me another chance.

No! Okay, here's something.

Get on a plane with me.

While you think about it, put this on my card.

It's the black one.

Wow.

That just happened.

You think maybe we should take his card and buy him a new shirt? I'm scared he'd want to change it in front of us.

I'm Cece.

Hi, Cece.

I'm Buster.

I really hope that's a nickname.

No, it's not a nickname.

It's your real name? I was bullied pretty bad.

Hi, Buster.

All right, hold on.

I've got quite an eye for young boys.

Oh, God.

That's right, I said it.

It's not a typo.

Let's see some I.

D.

God, you're handsome.

I'm sorry.

Wyoming! - Look at that.

Mm-hmm.

Wyoming.

So you're one - of the three people from Wyoming.

Yeah.

Cowboy state, big sky country, home of the Liberty Bell.

Bull snatch.

That's an awful accent.

What is your real accent? Are you Australian or from Heaven? How old are you, for real? - Leave him alone.

Don't bull-snatch a bull-snatcher.

Leave him alone.

You're over 21, right? I'm not.

Um I'm 20.

Get out of here, you delicious bastard.

Can I get my I.

D.

back? - No, of course not, you can't.

It'd be against the law, you wonderful creature.

Nice to meet you, Cece.

Good God, you look nice.

Nothing irks me like underage drinking.

It's stupid, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible.

God, I want to have sex with that kid so bad, it's freaking me out! Oh.

I'm real tingly.

We have talk about the budget.

There's a problem with the budget? But it's due Monday.

Yeah.

Do we have too much money? - No.

We need to f*re people.

What? - And when I say "we," I mean you.

Start with the most recent hires.

Well, we have, um Janet from the history department.

Human garbage.

Okay.

Ernie, uh Ah, yeah.

No.

That's Coach.

No.

No.

No.

No, he's very good at his job.

Last one in, first one out.

You know how this works.

That's just wrong.

This is the job, Ms.

Day.

He's my friend.

I can't.

No.

I'm not doing it.

I'm not f*ring Coach.

This is the job, Ms. Day.

Do you want it or not? I'm what? We had to do budget cuts, and we have to let two people go, and you're my friend, and I couldn't stop it.

I'm so sorry.


We all pitched in.

Thanks, guys, I'm not coach anymore.

I'm just Coach.

What? - What? Morning, Winston.

Are you not talking to me? Look, I had to f*re Coach for my job.

I didn't want to.

Don't squint at me.

Don't do that.

I did it for my job.

It wasn't my choice.

Hey, Nick, what's up, man? - What's up, Winnie? - Hey, Nick.

Hey.

Can we talk for a second? - Can I talk to you? Schmidt fired me, and now I'll never get to use this briefcase I just bought, and it was $19! - I think my thing is a little bit more - Do you think I'm sexier when I hold it or when it's down? 'Cause I think it's kind of sexier when I hold it, like this.

Not really.

Do I look like a man of power? Imagine this: It's, like, a rainy day, I'm on the streets of New York, Hey! Stop that cab! I'm a businessman.

I'm late to an important meeting.

I honestly feel like I would've been so good at this.

You don't want to be a lawyer.

Why do you care whether - Schmidt fired you or not? - I spent all those years at law school with those preppy dicks and I never got to prove them wrong, Jess.

Okay, go after what you want.

Just make sure that what you want doesn't make you a cog on the wheel - of a larger, flawed system.

Stop it.

Shut your mouth.

'Cause what you're saying is beautiful.

I'm gonna go put on my power suit.

High and loud, girl.

Whoo! Um Good talk, Nick.

With this thing, I feel so sexy, It's disgusting.

I think you misunderstood - Whoo! - Your representation running late? - Uh, no.

Actually, I'll be representing myself today.

Sorry we're late.

What? - This building is a total mess.

Nick Miller of, uh, Cooper, Bishop and Furguson.

As you know, my boss and senior partner, Mr.

Winston Furguson.

Gentlemen, pleased to be with you.

Please, please don't get up, don't get up.

I-I insist.

Madam Secretary.

What are you doing here? - I'm representing you.

Everything all right? - I'm a bit caught off guard.

I wasn't expecting these two very real lawyers to show up today.

Well, we wanted to let you know that the entire firm is standing behind you.

Besides, whether I sit in my office or in here it's all billable.

Am I right, gentlemen? Shall we get into this, or just take our pants off? Ask him a question.

Let me Let me do my thing.

Do your thing.

Mr.

Baker.

Yes? What's your home address? Okay.

Uh, no no further questions.

What? - Keep going.

Ow! Just keep going.

What are you Don't h*t me.

What are you hitting me for? - Is everything all right? - Sure it is.

The meter's running.

Even though you don't work at Coolidge anymore, you'll still be Coach Coach to those kids.

It's Coach Coach.

Yeah, Coach Coach.

Coach Coach.

Coach Coa - Coach Coach.

I'm sorry.

It's all good, Jess.

You did what you had to do.

I'm proud of you for that, okay? - Yeah.

I hope I'm the first of many you f*re.

That really means a lot to me.

I am gonna miss those kids, though.

Yeah.

That's what I'm gonna miss.

Those little those little bastards.

Little Ronnie.

Ronnie's so clumsy and slow.

Yeah.

Thomas.

I mean, he's strong, but that boy is a classic middle child.

He's just looking for love, up, back and sideways.

And Maurice.

He always makes a mess whenever he eats a Popsicle.

It's, like, dude, stop sucking your Popsicle like that, man.

You're never gonna get a girlfriend like that.

And then there's Hunter.

God Fat cross-eyed clod-hopping Hunter.

Hunter is the sweetest little idiot there ever was.

He's so sweet! He's so sweet! Ahh Screw this! Because you told me to go after what I wanted, and this is not what I wanted.

Let's go! We're gonna get you to that game! It's okay.

They're playing Pasadena.

They don't stand a chance.

Pasadena has a bunch of bitch-ass tricks.

Weren't raised right.

Hey, what do you want? I don't know.

I want to be there.

So, spike that ball! That was not a ball.

That was beer.

I know.

I feel really bad about it.

You know what? Don't feel bad! - Let's go! - Let's go! - You got me all fired up! I think you're gonna have to drive.

Mr.

Miller: "Were you or were you not wearing oversized shoes in the store?" Mr.

Baker: "I was not.

I told you that.

" Mr Miller: "But are you sure?" Mr.

Schmidt: "Shut up, Nick.

" Mr.

Miller: "Let me do this.

Ow.

Stop it.

" Mr.

Schmidt: "Stop what? You're hitting yourself.

" Mr.

Miller: "You're a child.

" Mr.

Schmidt: "A child would be a better lawyer.

" Mr.

Furguson: "Children are our future.

" Mr.

Berklan: "So true.

" Mr.

Miller: "I need to regroup.

I'm gonna stall a little bit.

Watch this.

Could the lady typer read that back?" All right, all right, we've had enough.

My client is graciously willing to settle for $20,000.

As an actual real attorney, I highly suggest you take the deal.

Great.

We'll do - Not a chance.

There's not a chance.

Sidebar.

Come on, Schmidt.

Hurry up.

Just You are not taking that settlement.

Well, Nick, at least if it's $20,000, I can get out of that hole some day.

I've got a plan.

You just have to give me a chance.

Can you believe in me? All right, I believe in you.

Deal.

Deal.

What's the plan? Oh, I'm not telling you.

You're gonna get too mad.

Let's go.

Nick, I take it back! I don't I don't believe in you! Here.

Day? - What? What is going on? I thought you fired Coach.

Look, Coach loves the kids, and the kids love him.

I want this job, but I'm not going to do it your way.

I'm not going to let our best people go.

You were the one who told me, we have no money.

Yeah, but we can make it up in other ways, we can be creative.

We can rent out the multipurpose room after school to local clubs.

And where will the orchestra practice? Did you ever consider that, Ms.

Day? Or were you too busy buying a ladies bike? - What? - They can use the library.

No one goes in there anyway.

Yeah, let's burn the books! Except for The Da Vinci Code.

Well, that took a weird turn, but Thank you, Susan.

That-that's so nice.

What a great solution.

Come on! Let's do it! Oh! Hunter, you animal! Yeah! h*t the robot.

So, are you gonna sit, or? No, I'm gonna stand.

'Cause isn't that what we are doing? Standing for the little guy? What is the plan? Injustice! I will not stand for it.

That is why I will sit right now.

I will sit down in this chair You're negligent! Aah! Get off me! My neck! My neck! Seriously? The fall-down on the chair bit? - Is this your first case? - Yes, it is.

And that is why I'll file petition on petition.

You're gonna wake up in the morning to paperwork.

You're gonna go to bed at night to paperwork.

So how about this, gentlemen? You pay the $20,000 settlement to your client yourself, and you'll never see our faces again.

What do you call a lunatic who's only got one case and no hobbies? Your worst nightmare.

Let's go, guys.

Oh, I knew you'd come back for me.

So what do you want to do now? You want to just drive? Oh, no.

Mike! - What? - Ple I got it.

Thank you.

Hey, what you doing here? - I just wanted to come and say - Mm-hmm.

First things first.

The legal drinking age in Australia is 18.

Second, you're really beautiful.

Like, you're really beautiful.

Like, I want to take you out some time.

But because I'm 20 and already at a bit of a disadvantage, I thought I'd come and do some uncharacteristic self-promotion to help the cause? - Okay.

And let you know that well, I just opened my own business.

I build boats.

Uh, wooden boats with my hands.

Mm-hmm.

Um, old ladies love me.

They call me sensitive.

And I'm a really good cook.

But I know three dishes, and two of those dishes are the same thing.

Yeah, that's about it, so, what do you think? Do you want to get a drink? Like a soft drink with you? - Soft drink, a walk.

Can you have a coffee? - Yeah, I love coffee.

Mm-hmm.

It's one of the three meals that I know how I make.

All right.

Oh, do it! - Well, done, sir! - Oh! - Oh, yeah.

Or you know what? We could actually we could probably just go now.

I'd like to comb your hair, you hunk.

I don't know who they are.

They just come in here, and they drink, and make a lot of noise and talk about things they don't know about! Hey, Mike, I'm gonna take a break.

Um I don't know when I'll be back.

I'll just meet you out front.

Stop what you're doing.

There's a lawyer here to make Jessica? Jessica, I won the case.

If you woke up right now, we could be making love.

Jessica? Power couple.

03x18 - Sister III

by bunniefuu Â» 03/06/14 21:25

Thank you so much for having us over for brunch, guys.

It's the least that we could do to celebrate the one-week anniversary of your sister moving in with me and becoming my live-in lover.

Was a little fast.

Babe, you have syrup on your face.

Oh, you can get it.

Mmm.

Babe, you have some powdered sugar (muffled): Back off! I'm starving! Come on.

Just let me get it off.

It's so much.

Get your own French toast, Jess! I got these slices, so they're for me to eat.

If you want the slices, get your own slices.

Coach: Um, that's your fourth plate, Winston.

I'm trying to bulk up for the LAPD fitness exam.

I am going to ace this obstacle course.

Schmidt, you got something crazy around your neck.

Abby made this.

Look.

Ow.

Look at that.

Not a fan.

I forgot how much I love making jewelry.

Schmidt's been lending me money for supplies.

Yeah.

Schmidt, are you bleeding? Oh, look at that.

I most certainly am.

Wow.

What makes Abby's jewelry so interesting is that it's actually dangerous and can cut you.

Abby's gonna open up her own store one day.

Mark my words.

She shouldn't do that.

Nope.

I'm gonna open up a store in your mouth.

But now that you're living here, I can have my old room back.

Jess, I'm gonna need you gone by 5:00.

Done.

I need a break from Snore-a Ephron over here.

Okay.

Oh, Schmidt and I don't need any space.

We have no boundaries.

But I guess not everybody can have what Schmidt and I have.

You guys will probably get there.

Don't worry.

Remember how long it took you to get boobs? Yeah, but I started shaving my legs at nine.

So joke's on you.

Mmm.

Wait.

We have so much sex.

Don't try to eat the other slice.

I'm gonna get to it.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

Can you believe Abby and Schmidt? Yeah, tell me about it.

Making love at their own brunch? No class.

They're a fake couple.

They're not real.

We're a real couple.

If anyone should be moving in together, it's us.

Well, you know, we already live in the same apartment.

Right.

So why not take the extra step? We basically sleep in each other's rooms every night, so what is the difference? It's a really big difference.

Because right now we're roommates but we're not living together.

Not "living together.

" - You know? - No.

Living together is a step.

It's official.

It's an official step in a relationship.

So the word "official" is the key.

Abby and Schmidt did it after one week.

Come on.

We have so much left to learn about each other, stuff you can only learn if you're crammed together in a small space and you can't get out.

Just you and me.

Four walls.

No boundaries, no escape.

When you put it like that, it sounds amazing.

And like prison.

Well, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room.

It's so close.

Just pop over there.

Mm.

Do you not want to? - Whoa.

(whistles) I did not - That did not - So you're saying you do want to? (chuckles) Oh, my God, Nick, we're moving in together! - Officially? We just agreed on it? - Yes! Yes! I cannot think of a reason why not to.

Reason 13: I like my stuff and I hate her stuff.

Reason number 14: How am I ever gonna change my clothes? You don't change in front of your girlfriend? You get naked in front of her.

Yes, but those are different things.

When you're naked, you're powerful and it's glorious.

When you're changing, you're hunched over and cowering, like an animal.

Animals don't wear clothes, Nick.

All I'm saying is I need my space.

True intimacy.

Embrace that.

Abby and I, we have one sponge.

And we use it for everything.

I don't like that, but you seem happy.

Don't hold back, Nick.

Expose your cracks and love will fill them.

That's nice.

Thank you.

Do you know how hard it's been for me to take this conversation seriously while you're wearing - that thing around your neck? - It's an Iroquois throat band.

That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

Yeah, you're jealous.

No, I'm not.

It's not just a choker, it's story.

What's the story? She didn't have enough supplies? - I'm not through the whole thing yet.

I got to tell you, man, looking at that thing, the sex must be awesome.

Coach: Cece and I have been hanging out a lot more lately.

She sort of treats me like I'm one of her girl friends, and (strained): You don't like it? I love it.

I mean, usually, when I'm friends with a girl, I'm either trying to get that butt or she's trying to get this butt.

But with Cece, it's not about the butt.

(chuckles) It's not about the butt, man.

It's cool.

It's like We're like sisters.

What? Coach.

Hey, do you have, uh, Schmidt's keys? Kind of got a weird favor to ask.

It's only weird if you don't ask, girl.

(laughs) - What? - That's what I'm talking about.

(meows) (grunts) You know I'm doing this for you, right? - Somewhere - This is great.

(chuckles) What are we doing? We are snooping on Abby.

Oh, love it.

I do not trust that girl.

She's always working an angle.

Now she's got Schmidt all wrapped up, giving her money for "jewelry.

" Treachery! (Coach screams) First, they came for my silverware and I said nothing.

What's up, dawg? - What are you guys doing here? Schmidt, I know that Abby is fun and she is charming, but I'm telling you, she's bad news.

Is that why you guys are sorting through my garbage? I appreciate the concern, you guys, but Abby has changed.

Coach: Then how do you explain this? I put my coffee grounds in a plastic bag so it doesn't get the rest of my trash dirty.

Really? - Yeah, he does that.

You got clean-ass trash, man.

I don't even need gloves for this.

Quit sorting through my trash, Coach.

You're messing it all up.

Schmidt, you've known this girl for a couple weeks, okay? I've known her for 20 years, and, I am telling you, she's not to be trusted.

Your words are changing his opinions about things.

(chuckles) Up top.

Mm.

You two as friends is a real bummer.

I'm not into it.

Jess: Our first night living together.

I'm just excited.

Expose your cracks and love will fill them.

I'm changing.

Great.

I'm reading.

Okay.

Yeah, I'm just gonna take my pants off.

Okay.

(grumbling) You know, I've seen you naked before, right? What's going on there? Oh! Never changed in front of a woman.

You know, mostly you just hook up and - Really? Are you serious? All right, I'm gonna read.

(clears throat) Okay.

Here we go.

(Nick moans) Yeah, it's Just gonna put this on here.

What is that? Oh, this is my long shirt.

(snorts) - Yeah.

Oh.

That's why you're laughing.

I had it on the wrong way.

(laughs) That must have been funny-looking the way it was.

I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.

And so yeah.

Why does your bottom need to breathe? Well, it's like a plant.

Needs sun and air to survive.

Never mind.

Um I like it.

Um yeah.

Great.

I like it.

(grunts) Okay.

This is great.

This is great.

I'm excited.

Me, too.

What are you doing to the pillow? - I'm trying to get comfortable.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

Got it.

I can't I'm gonna go to sleep.

Turn off the light.

Great.

Mm.

Ow! What? So-Sorry.

Sorry.

What the hell is that nightmare? - I just have to Sorry.

Just reading.

Yeah.

You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna sleep with my head over there.

Okay.

Yeah, that's That's gonna be better for me.

You know what, I'm gonna get some water.

(muffled music playing) - Oh, hey.

My room looks totally different.

Turned it into a workout space.

I am so glad it opened up.

Oh, why didn't we do this sooner? Crab walk.

You don't know where a crab's gonna go.

And you know what? Where does the crab go? Oh! Oh, aah! Owie.

(elevator bell dings) Hi.

Just enjoying the peace and quiet.

Whoa, hold up.

Hey, Jess, what are you doing? Oh, I just, you know, sometimes I work in the elevator now.

(whispers): You know, helping some of the older residents.

Hmm? (elevator bell dings) (loudly): This is your floor, ma'am.

So, how are things going with you and Schmidt living together? I have never felt so clean while being so dirty.

Awesome.

Last night, Schmidt wanted to take me to a hotel, but we could not even get out of the loft without ripping each other's clothes off.

Oh, that's our thing, too.

We have the hotel until tomorrow night and it's all paid up.

You guys might as well use it.

Take it off our hands.

(elevator bell dings) Lobby, please.

(mouths words) Wait, I forgot Bernie.

Hold the elevator.

Bernie, Bernie, where are you, you idiot? I'll just be here, waiting.

Winston: So, Nick, the police academy training is going well, but I'm a little worried about the rings, because of the you know the incident.

(laughter) Shut up, you guys, I can do this.

No, Miller, no, Miller, no! (laughter) (laughs) I'm sor I got big laughs.

You got to give the people what they want.

Everybody saw my ding-a-ling, Nick.

My ding-a-ling.


I've got an issue that's more important than this.

Ever since Jess moved in, I haven't had a second to myself.

You see what she's done to my writer's desk? It's like an arts and crafts area now, man.

Hey, guys.

Hey.

I'm staying at a hotel tonight.

Not alone.

With other people.

I have to chaperone a field trip to Sacramento, so You know what, you seem too busy to talk about it.

Go, go.

I'm gonna miss you.

I'm gonna miss you.

Wait, weren't you just saying how you Whoa, dude! (Jess laughs) - Good one, Nick.

Bye.

Bye, yeah.

That, uh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

Schmidt: I can't believe I let you guys talk me into tailing my own girlfriend.

Cece: Look at this neighborhood, Schmidt, she is up to no good.

I feel very uncomfortable being here, I trust Abby, I don't want to spy on her any more, okay? We're not spying.

We're just carefully watching.

Girlfriend is going down.

Yeah, she is.

Let us bust her, buster.

(giggles) That was a good one.

That was.

Yeah.

Okay.

(both sigh) This dynamic between the two of you It's very annoying to me.

I'm sure I'm not alone on this.

Hi, hater.

Bye, hater.

Okay, enough is enough.

I'm getting out of here.

Hey, it's my car - Guys, guys.

I don't care whose car it is, I'm going.

I don't care who - It's my car.

Oh.

Aah! (gasps) Great.

h*t a parked car in the same neighborhood they sh*t friggin' Children of Men.

Yeah! I'm alone! (laughs) Yeah.

I made my reservation I'm leaving town tomorrow (yells happily) I'll find somebody new (grunts, laughs) I'm alone and I love it.

Coffee for one, a sundae for one, and the most tasteful, story-driven (whispers) adult film.

Preferably a period piece.

The farther in the past, the better.

You know what I'm talking about, girl.

(sobs) Do you have anything in the Byzantine Era? No? All right, just a sh*t in the dark.

Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley (sobbing): It's so little.

It's so little.

Bump, bump, bump went my heartstrings When he smiled, I could feel the car shake (pounding on wall): I'm trying to sleep! - Okay! - Which ding is ours? - Which ding is ours? Coach, there are Kn*fe holes in the door.

What does it matter? Let's get out of here.

At least write "sorry" and put it under the windshield wiper There are none.

Uh Maybe put it under the d*ad bird's leg? - Hobo! - Aah, there's a dude! (screaming) Ho-ho-hobo, for real! - Hobo! - Son of a bitch Hobo.

Thank you, Jingles.

You got it, girl.

Hey.

What are you guys doing here? Tailing me? - No.

Um - Yes, we're tailing you.

I know how you work: You glom onto guys and then you just bleed them dry.

Well, you are not gonna do it to Schmidt.

What's in the box? Tell us what's in the box.

Zippers.

What? (laughs) Z Zippers, you guys.

Guy up there'll give you a great deal.

He also loves cr*ck.

Can we go now? Thank you, Abby, let's go.

My car is gone.

Well, that's not surprising.

Oh, you can do this.

You can do this, Winnie.

What are you doing here? On a school day? I see this means you're the cutting type.

Which means you're the pantsing type.

Well, I got news for you, buddy.

You ain't getting 'em! Not today.

How 'bout I take your pants, huh? Not like that, everybody! I'm not trying to take the little kid's pants.

He's trying to take my pants.

You see how he's eyeing my pants? So I eyed his pants You know what? You win.

You win, you little son of a bitch.

You win! I don't want to tell you how to police your beach, but right now there are truants outside of this hotel, stirring up trouble.

Hey, yo, lookin' good, Charlie! Debbie, see you at 1:00 on the massage table.

Winston.

Mm.

We are gonna sneak into Schmidt's and see what's really inside those boxes.

Cece, darling - Hmm? - What? - How long have we been friends? A week or so? - And have I ever steered you wrong? - Well, no Exactly.

Because I know you better than anyone, girl.

And you're acting like a lunatic.

I mean, the kind of lunatic other lunatics look at and go, "Oh, my God, that bitch a lunatic.

" So I'm gonna need you to figure out why you're really doing all this for Schmidt and then sort it out.

You did not just say that to me.

Think about it, girl.

sh**t Just to be clear, I did not ask you to act like this, okay? - It's just kind of fun to do - Slow down, girl.

You gonna eat that scone? - Damn it.

Slow down.

Are you-are you gonna have this scone? - Hey, man.

Hey, man.

Just looking at my Garbage Pail Kids.

Jess makes me put 'em in a box.

How are you gonna put art like this in a box? What's going on with you? Nothing You will not tell Nick that you saw me here because then he'll get upset and I'm gonna have to move into my old room, and that means that we suck as a couple and that Abby was right and I cannot let that happen.

Jess went to a hotel because sharing a room with you is driving her crazy.

(relieved moaning) Dude, at really was a tough one to keep in, but, honestly, I held my own and I did - my best.

Are you kidding me?! I can't believe it! I changed in front of her! Sharing a room is driving you crazy, too.

But I didn't lie about it.

I never get to win these things.

So, anyway, I just want to apologize.

It was wrong of me to get involved.

Are you sure you don't want to tap Abby's phone? Run a DNA sample? I don't want to be coarse, but the bedroom is covered in it.

I was worried about you, okay? I didn't want her to take advantage of you 'cause I know that you will do anything for the people that you care about.

Well, I guess I could say the same thing about you.

And, you know what, maybe Abby has changed.

I'm thinking about helping Abby lease a storefront - for her jewelry.

Is that crazy? - It's - (chuckles) It's amazing.

Don't hold back.

Here.

Here, I want you to have this.

Oh.

Abby made it.

Oh Mm It's a cough drop and - these are hard candies.

I see that.

I truly hate it.

You're welcome.

(sighs) - Oh.

Oh, hey.

How was Sacramento? It was great.

The kids cried when they saw the capital.

Oh, did they? How many students showed up? - What hotel did you stay at? - Old Sacramento Inn.

What room did you stay in? - 523.

What floor was that on? - Five.

Was there an elevator to the 4th floor? - 5th floor.

Smoking or non-smoking? - Smoking.

You don't smoke.

In Sacramento, I do.

What'd you have for breakfast? - Continental.

How are you this good at lying?! I know you're making this all up! I know you didn't go to Sacramento.

I know you went to a hotel to be by yourself.

Damn it, Winston! - Nick loved being alone, too! - Damn it, Winston! - That's for my ding-a-ling! You didn't like living together either? No, but it was your idea, and it seemed like the thing to do.

But at least I didn't lie about it, Jess.

Okay, I did! But you were driving me crazy.

(quietly): You wear a nightgown.

Are you talking about my long shirt? You look like the Little Match Girl, wandering around Victorian England selling matches for a penny.

I look like George Washington.

I was just trying to be a good couple.

Schmidt and Abby are doing it.

Well, Schmidt and Abby are crazy.

They're doing a lot of things.

Why can't we do this? I don't know.

Hey.

Hey.

Uh-oh.

Last time I saw you day-drinking was when you got kicked out of jazz ensemble.

I'm still pissed off about that.

What does that mean, "too enthusiastic"? How come you're not at the hotel? Did you and Nick break the bed? Because, legally, they cannot make you pay for that.

No.

I was by myself.

Oh, I've broken the bed by myself.

Big-time.

No, I went to the hotel to get away from Nick.

And I wore a robe and I watched a documentary about Ethel Kennedy and it was one of the best nights of my life.

So you win.

Your relationship's better than mine.

And I can't even share a room with Nick.

I don't win.

Come on.

I swing from guy to guy.

I don't think I have ever paid my own rent.

You travel the world, collecting lovers.

All my lovers could fit in one SUV.

And, yes, maybe somebody would have to sit on someone's lap, but they would fit.

And you're just brave.

You and Nick are brave.

You guys know each other, you get under each other's skin.

He has the feet of a hippy cult leader.

But that's the difference.

I just throw myself into whatever comes along because I really don't want to be alone.

Why not? Being alone's great.

You should try it sometime.

Seriously.

It might help you figure yourself out.

(sighs) You're Abby Freaking Day.

You can do whatever you want.

Except vote.

(laughs) But, seriously, you should've seen Nick's feet.

The bottoms are all black, except for one patch of yellow.

(laughs) - Hey.

Hey.

What are you doing? - Oh, just packing up your things and then I thought about what you would want and how you probably didn't want to move again, so I decided to do the right thing and just take your room.

My room's bigger.

Is it? I never - Nice try.

All right.

I got to move some stuff back then.

(chuckles) - Hey.

I'm sorry that this didn't work out.

I'm sorry that we sucked.

Look, we don't suck.

I'm crazy about you, but I don't have to spend every second with you in what amounts to a one-room log cabin.

Cabins are what drove the Pilgrims crazy.

That's why they k*lled each other at the Plymouth Rock m*ssacre.

That's not a real thing.

So how did the millions of Pilgrims die? There definitely weren't millions of Pilgrims.

Then how do you explain my 37-page essay about it? - I think you made it up in your head.

This seems like one of those - "agree to disagree" moments - No.

It's not.

I'm also older than you.

Anyway, I love you and someday we'll make this work.

I think so, too.

Just-just not now.

Not like this.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But if you're not doing anything, want to come over? I am over.

(knocking) - Oh! - Hey, guys.

Uh, just a little hot goss from apartment 4C.

Abby's gone.

What? - She's gonna stay with your mom for a little bit.

Something about saving up to be independent? Wow.

Good for her.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

You know in hindsight, maybe we moved a little bit too fast.

I just wish that I had realized that - before I rented her a storefront.

You rented her a storefront? It was a three-year lease in an undesirable neighborhood.

(chuckles) It totally obliterated my bank account, so I've decided to sublet my place, and I'll be moving back here, under duress.

Y-You're moving back in here? Well, it shouldn't be a problem, right? I mean, Coach is in my room, and you guys are now moving in together.

I'll just move into Jess' room.

Cool? - Yeah, but, like - Asking was just kind of a formality.

'Cause my name's on the lease, so You guys are the best.

Oh (sighs) (chuckles) - Yay! - Yay.

Cool.

Great.

Let's do this.

We can make it work.

You have to start washing your feet.

Man, this is gonna be fun! - Ah, come on! Get it close to the light.

Okay, just because you invented Sky Kn*fe doesn't mean you can tell me how to throw.

Hurry up, man.

You can do this.

One, two, three.

All: Sky Kn*fe! (cheering) Yeah! What's up? Oh, hey.

What's up? Nothing, just a Hey, uh, straight-up chillin'.

(indistinct chatter) Jess: You guys, it's a really long story, but I think I saw an eagle.

I was shopping for books on Western Oh, my God! (all exclaim) - Oh! - Oh! Oh, God, what the hell? You were in the drop zone.

Good save, Nick.

You were a hero! Good save.

We were playing Sky Kn*fe.

You mad? No.

No.

I I think it's been a great game this week.

I'm amazed at how great it is.

Uh! Awesome! I thought you were gonna be mad.

All right.

I'm gonna go get the bad-ass knives from Schmidt's house.

Cool.

Get 'em, girl.

Um, guys, we have a problem.

I know, but Abby's gonna fix it.

She's going to get the cooler knives.

The problem is Abby.

She's been here one week and has already created chaos everywhere.

I don't know if anybody noticed, but she destroyed my sunflower painting - with a picture of a penis.

The iguana's cool.

I like the iguana.

Who doesn't love an iguana? - I like its tail.

Yeah.

Oh, my God, you guys, it's Terry.

The bastard found me.

He wants his stuff.

Who's Terry?! What's his stuff?! Cocaine drugs?! Worse.

You guys got to hide.

Oh, my God, I knew this was gonna happen.

Everybody in your earthquake spots now! - Jess! (laughter) She's messing with you.

(laughter) Yeah, I know.

We are messing with you.

No.

I don't think you were involved.

Don't taunt you, dude.

You guys were all afraid of Terry.

Us Day sisters up to our old pranks.

You're not part of it.

(in high-pitched voice): Yes, I am! - You got messed with.

You got messed with, not me.

You're doing that voice when you get messed with.

No, I'm not.

You guys, this is so fun.

I want to live here.

(fake laughing): Ah, ha, ha! That was funny, 'cause we're messing with you again.

No.

I'm serious.

That one was real.

I think I should live here.

I hate this game.

(all exclaiming) Hey, girl What you doing? Hey, girl Where you going? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

You looking up how to eat a bagel? - (laughs) No.

I'm, uh, seeing if I passed the LAPD entrance exam.

Results go up in 30 seconds.

If you pass, you get to be a cop? No, I get to go to the police academy, you know? Hope I get a dog partner.

Yeah.

Oh, you are pretty calm for someone who's about to get life-changing news.

You must be really cool under pressure.

No! I'm a huge choker.

Huge! (laughs) Girl, I ain't had a job in over three months.

So, this is that moment, I guess, when you find out if you're really a failure or not.

Check it.

Excitement's k*lling me! Man, would you look at the time? Man.

Girl, I got an obligation at a sandwich meeting to to go to.

Yes Nick (in dramatic voice): Well, you see, loyalty has a price, Mr.

President.

Give me the hot dogs! Put the damn hot dogs in the bag, you son of a bitch, and I won't Oh, my God.

What are we gonna do? She can't move in to Take that off.

I hope those are clean.

Enough.

I don't want to be involved with your weird thing with your sister.

It's not a weird thing with my sister.

She is crazy.

No.

She's wanted in Canada.

Canada.

No one's wanted in Canada.

Hey, uh, you guys want to hang out, like, right now? Maybe go up to Alhambra, try on a whole mess of jeans? Don't you find out about that cop test today? Oh, you know Oh, yeah.

No.

Look, man, the Alhambra thing, though it's getting a lot of momentum, you know? So I think I'm gonna go ahead and do that 'cause when you you know, when you do that, so Okay, I'm gonna guarantee you that Abby is responsible for that.

Winston: Yeah, she got to me.

If you don't want Abby to live here, Jessica, why don't you just tell her? Nick, you can't just tell Abby to do something, 'cause she'll do the opposite.

So I'm gonna have to go find a place for her to live and make her think it's her idea.

She can't find out what I'm up to.

Do you think you can keep her busy and lie to her all day? Jess, I come from a family of con artists and liars.

And the one thing I learned is, you can't lie to a liar.

It don't fly.

Yeah, you shouldn't be involved.

No, I shouldn't.

Wait a second.

Are you doing reverse psychology? Yeah, it is reverse psychology.

That is reverse psychology, so you just reversed it, so now it's reverse, reverse, which is just psychology.

Hmm, which one is it? You outfoxed me.

I'm in.

I'm gonna do it.

So, our time is up, but, um, I don't have any more clients, so, uh Oh.

You brought it with that less set, ma.

I got to tell you.

I mean, what can't that butt do? - You shaped it, so you get dibs.

Mmm.

Dibs.

(laughter) Can I get dibs? Because both y'all butts look great.

I mean, I can't tell who's in first place.

Hey, uh, Coach, you know how you're always getting on me about my pizza baby? - Yeah.

Well, today is the day that I get rid of it.

I am here to train.

Save it, dude.

You're avoiding your test results.

Nick texted me.

Guess you can't outrun a text.

Nope.

Well, with the right amount of training All right, listen to me.

Um, I need you to leave.

I'm with a client.

A beautiful one.

I'm trying to, you know - Mm.

(whistles) You're trying to whistle.

No, no, no, no, no, I'm trying to have sex with her.

Oh! Sex.

But I did book you for the entire afternoon, though.

(groans) - Why would you do that? - But if you guys are doing a little thing, then I could easily just - Leave and check your test scores? - do a tandem session.

Oh, fun.

Right? Coach, you should show him that ground stretch you did on me earlier.

It was opening me up really nicely.

Yes, please.

(laughs) I don't wanna.

(grunts) Oh.

(sighs) (Winston grunts) This is amazing.

Oh! I'm taking a little trip here, Coach.

You know where I'm going.

Why do I keep looking down? I don't know.

This museum is my favorite place in Los Angeles.

Um come on, Nick.

Jess is making you babysit me, right? Babysit you? (laughing): What? Like you're a little baby? No.

That's how you want to play this? - Well, I'm not "playing" it.

Oh.

Hey, hey, hey.

What are you doing? - I just want to touch it.

Don't touch it.

I just need to touch it.

But it's not for touching.

(inhales) - Hey, hey! What? Can I not jump on it? - Abby.

That's not allowed? - Abby! - Maybe I shouldn't climb all over the car.

You need to get off of that car.

Why don't you tell me what it is Jess is up to? Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you're scratching the hood! Tell me what I want to know.

Get off there right now.

There's nothing to tell! - Tell me what I want to know.

There's nothing to tell! - Tell me what she's doing! - Get her off! - If I tell you, will you get off the car? - Yes.

You promise? - Yes.

She's looking for a safe apartment for you 'cause she doesn't want you to live with us! Now, would you please get off the car? Do you guys serve drinks here? (sighs) Why don't they give us Tasers? Wow.

I mean, this place is beautiful.

It makes the other nine places we've seen today just kind of fade away.

Yeah, um, tell me about the neighborhood.

Is there a lot of nightlife? Well, this part of town is pretty quiet.

Unless you count church bells.

Which you should.

We have nine within hearing distance.

What about the other tenants? Are there single men between 18 and 65? Actually, make that 16 and 72.

Most of the other tenants are middle-aged gay veterans like myself.

Oh.

Whoa.

Jackpot.

And if the demons come calling, there's an emergency room right across the street.

You had me at "gay veterans.

" And then again at "emergency room.

" And before that at "church.

" I wish I could just travel back in time and tell 19-year-old me to move into a place like this.

Maybe I would've settled down.

Met a, you know, nice guy.

Nothing flashy.

Works in a bank, makes a great veggie lasagna.

Okay, not now, Cece.

No, don't stop her.

Who is this guy? (laughs) Right? (sighs) Bet you are a mean dancer.

Come on.

Live a little.

You were right to call me.

Nobody deals with crazy girls better than I do.

Crazy girls are kind of my Hurt Locker.

You know what I mean, Nick? - Okay.

Yeah.

Some-some men, they can just walk away.

Not me.

I just keep coming back.

Okay, are you gonna help me - get her off the car? - Mmm.

You know what this is, Nick? - What? - This is nonsense.

Exactly.

And how do we deal with nonsense? No, no.

We just don't stand for it is what we do.

Security is on the way.

Come on, you old bird.

Have you seen Abby? Huh? (sultry piano music playing) What are you what are you doing? I'm melting chocolate.

Abby and I are having sex.

(whispers): What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt? I've really changed my tune on nonsense, Nick.

You know, for the life of me, I could not understand the grasp that Jess had on you, but if she came from the same gene pool as this one (chuckles) kudos, my friend.

Even if it's a tenth of what I just experienced.

Even if it'sa DeVito/Schwarzenegger split from Twins.

You calling Jess the DeVito? - What? - Abby, I was supposed to be watching you.

Go ahead.

Don't don't play tricks with my words.

Jess is gonna k*ll me.

She's gonna say my name in that short, clipped way - where she doesn't add the "K.

" - What? When she's mad, she just says "Nic.

" Do you really think that the "K" adds to the sound of your name? - Yes.

How do you usually say your name? - Nick.

Say it without the "K.

" - Nic.

It's the same thing.

Stop distracting me! Nick, you're so worried about disappointing Jess.

Relax, man.

(ding) Okay, you got to get out of here.

(grunts) (moans) (grunts) (giggles) Oh I choked.

I choked, man.

I'm 31.

I have nothing figured out.

Can I not find a job? - I mean, I feel like I'm losing it.

Dude, they're hiring here.

You know I can't work here, man.

They never have any cookies.

It's all the better, man! There's no pressure.

You get this job and then when you're ready, you try the cop thing again.

Okay.

See? - Yeah.

But now I'm sitting here thinking about how badly I need this job.

Stop! - I need this job real bad Excuse me, um, could we get a job application over here, please? In a way, I have a lot more riding on this job than I do the cop thing.

God, I'd love to work here! Jess: I got the apartment! The place is great.

The only thing I'm a little worried about is there is a Russian grocery store down the block and Abby has a little bit of a weird thing with ethnic white people.

But I think she could really thrive there! Where is she? - Where's who? - Abby.

Ab? Oh, she's sleeping.

By herself.

Which is called "napping.

" Okay, I'm gonna start secretly packing up some of her stuff.

Do you think you can keep distracting her? - Yes, yeah, you know, just - Good.

how do we distract her? How do you distract a woman like that? Probably a guy.

(laughs): Right? Who can we set her up with? Well, well, well, who do we have? Coach.

(laughs) No.

Winston That's actually kind of a good idea No! - Schmidt! - That's a terrible idea.

But in the same sense Abby will wreck Schmidt! - Well, then luckily, the - So, here's the plan.

We're gonna have a nice dinner, we're gonna get her buzzed but not drunk.

And then we're gonna casually and naturally bring up the apartment so she thinks it's her idea.

And I can do that, okay? - Okay, good.

I'm glad.

I'll act cool, natural.

Casual.

Au naturel.

Au casual.

You know what? Maybe I should write you some lines, pal.

Yeah, I'd really appreciate that 'cause Maybe not a lot of words.

Uh, so tell me, what are your three weakest qualities? (chuckles) See (whispering): Just say "perfectionist.

" - Perfectionist.

Yeah.

And the other two um (laughs) (sputtering) I'm overheating, right? I'm overheating, okay? So here's what we're gonna do now I'm just gonna sh**t from the hip, little rapid f*re, give you some fun facts you might not know about me.

I hate standing up, I'm bad with numbers, and I just honestly, from the bottom of my heart, don't think women should be allowed to handle money.

Just, that's for real.

Let's just move on to the salary.

And you didn't even fill out the back of the application.

There's a back? There is a back to the application? - Coach.

What? The LAPD exam maybe it had a back.

You didn't check to see if it had a back? We got to go to the precinct.

I didn't choke.

I'm just careless.

And that is my biggest weakness, you bitch.

I'm so sorry, dude.

I'm so sorry, dude.

Yeah, that was bad.

Man, I didn't even mean that.

All right, get out of here.

Get out of here.

Dawg, I didn't mean that at all, man.

To our newest resident.

The City of Angels has sprouted another pair of wings.

It's a majestic city, drenched in sunshine, that is actually just a collection of 75 different neighborhoods.

Wow, I had no idea.

Please continue to tell me more.

You want more? - Who wants to rediscover couscous? Hey, what the hell are you doing here, Schmidt? I invited him.

I live here, too, right? - Yeah, but It's okay, Abby can make her own decisions, no matter what they might lead to.

Thank you.

Now, somebody call the pound 'cause my stomach is growling.

I said my stomach is growling.

Sp okay, uh, speaking of dinner, there are a lot of great options in North Hollywood.

It's a real hot spot full of young, hip people who will be the leaders of tomorrow.

More wine? - Great.

If I were moving to L.

A.

now, I'd say yes-ho to NoHo.

Nick: Hey, hey, what are you doing? Oh, my.

Stop touching him, Abby.

I'm sorry, what'd you say? - Touch him more? - Do not touch him.

What are you? Do not do this right now.

(whispering): How about that? As luck would have it, I actually know of a place in North Hollywood with great tile work.

(pouring wine) I said, "Great tile work.

" Oh, for the first 12 months.

(Jess laughs) I think what you really mean to say is there's an introductory offer - for cable television.

That's it, yeah Cable's a scam, I tell ya.

Sa Satellite.

What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt? Satellite's where it's at.

(whispering): Nonsense has the hands of an angel.

Okay, what's going on here? (chuckles) I told Abby about the apartment, and now she's giving Schmidt a sp a special.

Don't look at me.

Just look away.

Look away, look or look right at me.

So this was going on the whole time? - Yes.

And the hands are just the half of it.

I mean, there's been banging and poking and scratching and hanging and teasing such teasing.

I mean, really excruciating, life-giving teasing.

Shut up, Schmidt! She was talking to me.

This has been a whole day of lying and I can't take it.

First I had to lie to Abby, and so I spilled the beans - about the apartment.

I'm sorry.

And then I had to lie about Abby and Schmidt and the boning.

And then the manipulating and the out-manipulating That's lying! If you guys were just honest with each other for one second, none of this would have happened.

Okay.

All right.

Abby I'm really sorry I tried to trick you, but I just want what's best for you.

One of us has to! - You know, that is your problem.

You think you're better than people and you always try to fix them.

No, I don't! - Yes, you do.

You've done it your whole life.

It's annoying.

You know what? Yes.

Yes.

I would like to fix you.

No I would love to fix you! But I'm done trying.

Because you're not changing.

And you don't think or care about other people at all, and I do.

And that's why I don't want you living in this loft.

(scoffs) That's honest.

You're a garbage person and you should live in a Dumpster with rotten snails.

Hey! Nick! - Too far! - Yeah, way over the line, buddy.

Yeah, but I thought we were just piling in That's my sister, dude.

I didn't mean that, yeah.

Sorry.

Well, lucky for you, I'm moving out.

Oh, thank God, Abby.

Oh, my God.

You're really gonna like this place.

It's so nice - I'm moving in with Schmidt.

What what's that, now? You're moving in with who? - Seriously? - We would have sex all the time.

(chuckles) Dinner was lovely, you guys.

Thank you so much.

Bye.

What? - Schmidt: Ooh.

Hey, uh, Jess? Can I borrow your glasses? We're gonna role-play as you guys.

Ew.

No.

You don't understand.

She's not gonna be you.

I'm gonna be you.

Ugh! Get out, Schmidt! Get out of here! Okay Oh, God! Winston: What's up, my man? I took the test last week or should I say, I took the front part of the test last week and, sir, I am here to finish what I started.

What? What he's trying to say is, he took the entrance exam, but he forgot to do the back half.

Well, the test is administered on a computer.

There is no back.

You took the test on a computer? I choked.

I am a failure.

I am a loser.

I am never gonna amount to anything.

I'm never gonna sh**t somebody.

Dude.

Have some dignity, all right? Thank you for your time, sir.

Coach: Winston.

Winston! Yo! Winston! Dude, you failed, man.

You failed hard! At everything! - Dude, this pep talk sucks.

I'm not finished.

Like, seriously, it's like the Winston of pep talks.

Look at me.

You can do this, Winston.

Because now there's nothing to be afraid of.

You h*t rock bottom, man.

This is the worst it's gonna get.

Sir, it has been my dream to become a cop.

And no one's gonna stand in my way not you, not him Hey, I was helping.

and definitely not myself.

I would like to retake this test.

Well, there's one at 7:30 tomorrow.

Man, what about my last score makes you think I'm ready to take this test again in 12 hours? Coach: He'll be there.

Yeah, I'll be there.

Yeah.

Thank you for messing everything up and being such a terrible liar.

Uh, you are very welcome.

I think I really needed to say that stuff to my sister.

She's gonna wreck Schmidt.

Oof He has no idea.

I'm sorry my family's so crazy.

Crazy? Your family's not crazy.

My family's crazy.

My father used to trade horse semen.

I've got an uncle whose God-given name is Shifty.

(laughing) Well, thank goodness we're the sane ones.

(chuckles) So - Okay, now, remember: Up, and - Uh-huh.

(screams) (elevator bell dings) Hello, Abby.

Hey.

S'up? Have you thought about what you're gonna do if they pair you with a dirty cop? Well, then, I would just go to Internal Affairs.

Well, that's a good way to get k*lled.

Then at least I would die a hero.

Hmm, no, you won't.

They'll put you in panties and then they'll plant you next to a d*ad prost*tute.

That's a poor lady.

It'd be a dude.

But it's awesome! Good luck on the exam! They got dude prost*tute? Nuh-uh.

Hey, guys.

Bertie's playing it cool, but you guys coming over for dinner tonight is a really big deal to her, so Be there by 6, and no bailing.

Ooh, bailing on dinner.

Nick, I need you.

Wingman sitch.

Jewish girl, sensible nose.

High-level target.

I can't be your wingman.

We got to go this Bertie dinner.

Don't make it seem like a chore, okay? She is making ten or eleven soups.

And all of them are cream-based.

Cool.

Hey, Mom.

Hi, baby, I'm sorry to interrupt.

I know the morning is the most sensual time of day.

But, um, I need you.

It's your sister.

Abby? What is it? She was arrested at a hotel in San Diego.

How's everything with your sister? I mean, she was caught stealing, they called the cops, it's a mess.

Imagine me next door with a, with a nice Jewish girl.

Hey, Jess has a sister? - Yeah, I've never met her.

I need you to go to the jail, pick her up and put her on a plane home.

Oh, that's fabulous.

And by the way, um I don't know what kind of jail this is.

So be prepared for anything.

I mean, wear a shirt you don't love-love.

Okay.

Love you.

Hi Nick Okay, here, these are all the ladles that I could find.

Ooh, this one is deep.

Well, what's up with your sister? Well, she's coming to town.

Great! - Ooh, yikes, that's The best news ever? I know! It's so, so, so, so, so, so, so good.

Well, I can't wait to meet the mysterious Abby Day.

Not mysterious.

Jet setter.

You know, I always imagined her with a French-speaking black husband, like a Jerome St.

Pierre.

So, I'll probably meet her at the airport for a little layover hang.

Why are you ignoring me, Nick? - 'Cause I'm paying - Nick! - attention to my girlfriend.

There, a reaction! Thank goodness! Now I know I'm not a ghost.

All right, I got to go.

Oh, you're going? I'll, uh, I-I got to go.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jess, Jess! What if I came with? Yeah, you know, I don't think - you two would really get along.

Why not? Look, I just haven't seen her in a really long time, and Jess, I'd like to meet your sister.

Why don't we do this? Um Why don't I go pick her up? And then come meet us for a quick dinner before she leaves? That would be awesome.

That's all I was looking for.

Yeah.

Okay.

Winston, we can't make your dinner! - Bye, Winston.

I'm not gonna be with you.

Wait! No, no, no, no! Wait Hey, hey.

Are you really letting Nick meet Abby? Hell no.

I'm going to pick her up from jail.

Like, straight-up jail.

I told Nick he could meet her on her "layover" but, whoops, her flight got changed.

No time.

Sorry.

Bye, Nick! I'll see you later! - I'm out of shampoo! Gonna use bar soap! But your sister won't know the difference! Okay! Can't wait for you to meet her! He's never going to meet her.

Hey, dude.

I can't go to this dinner.

It's a double date now.

Things are already weird enough between me and Cece.

Because you went on a date two months ago and she never texted you? Yeah.

Be a man, Coach! - All right.

Be there by 6:00 and bring a bottle of wine.

And don't be cheap, either.

Bertie is a Somalian.

Okay.

Oh, tidings, Abigail.

I'm Jess's beau.

My name is Nicholas.

It's a pleasure to - Oh, good God.

Is that a common barber's comb? - Look, Schmidt, I just want to make a good impression on Jess's sister.

Yeah, well, I want Julia Child not to be d*ad, but here we find ourselves.

What did you come here to talk to me about? As I was saying earlier, I have a very difficult flirting situation here.

I mean, it's a double black diamond: trees, moguls.

And, as we both know, you're the best wingman who's ever wung.

Thank you, Schmidt! I'm almost glad I got in the accident so we can have more days like this together, with you helping me through this.

Hocod a guy so rich be so generous with his time? Whoa Excuse me.

Are you the writer of So You've Mastered the Female Orgasm, Now What? - Incredible.

Can I have your autograph? - Of course.

Come on, man.

It's a quick party.

I'll have you back by your little dinner.

Okay, I'll do it, but as soon as Jess says I've got to go, I'm out.

Thank you very much.

For your mitigated support and tiny portion of your life.

Sure.

Okay.

Hey, Abby.

Oh, look who came to pick up her big, bad sister.

So, you good to go? Or you gotta sign yearbooks or something? Bridget stole your gum.

What? You took my Fruity Fruit? I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch! - Oh, my God.

Oh - Gum? I want my Fruity Fruit! I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch! What about the new guy? I want to meet him.

We don't really have time to meet him 'cause I have to take you to the airport 'cause Mom's already bought you a ticket.

I know all of her credit card information, - No.

and I can just change it.

Wait, what are you doing? Wait, no.

Sweet.

Why don't you just for once in your life do something that you're not supposed to do? I didn't put the cap back on the honey bear the other day.

Drive.

Drive.

Drive.

Oh, my God.

No! No! - No! No! I will not drive unsafely! - Try-try it! I have a perfect record.

Get your hands away from me.

Why don't you want me to meet him? - About.

Are you embarrassed of me? - I do.

No.

Great.

'Cause I just got on a later flight.

That's great.

So excited.

I know.

Did you just start driving really slow? No, I actually think I'm speeding.

I hope there's no coppers around.

Drive faster.

Sorry, sir! Thank you for your service! - What is this place? - It's a bar mitzvah.

I am not watching a kid get circumcised.

The target is Rachael.

She's a Hebrew school teacher.

Crashing some random kid's bar mitzvah's the best way to get her? Get her on the dance floor, a little bit softer now, a little bit louder now, sweep her off her feet, we'll get married, we'll have a son named Elon.

At his bar mitzvah, I tell the story of how I met his mom at this bar mitzvah.

Not a dry eye in the house.

Jewiontinuity, et cetera, et cetera.

Do you realize how long you were just talking? There she is.

Whew! - A beautiful piece of hamentaschen.

What the hell is hamentaschen? Problem is her dad is my rabbi.

He hates me.

So I just need to charm Rachael before he gets to her and tells her horrible-slash-true things - about me.

Absolutely.

Oh! Hello! - What a day.

Oh a special day.

Oh, take my hand.

Take your hand.

A special day.

You just wanted to take my hand so you could say that again, didn't you? Mmm, I did.

I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting.

May I take your hand, too? You can take anything you want, Shirley.

So, yeah, just the just the two of us with Bertie and Winston tonight? Yeah, just, uh just-just you and me.

Uh, and Bertie.

And Winston.

Just eating night lunch.

Yeah, like a you know, like a date.

But not a date 'cause - Yeah.

Yeah.

So, uh - What is that? Is that a onesie? - Yeah.

How do you how do you take it off to use the bathroom? Mmm Whoa.

Oh, my God! - Hey! - You look, you know, amazing.

You look amazing.

Look at you.

Oh, my God.

I'm so happy you're not just paper-thin anymore.

You're just the best.

Hello, Hot Cocoa.

Whoa.

Nothing.

No.

Mmm, you want to have sex with her, you are not so sure.

If she doesn't want to put out, I will.

Abby Day - There you go.

Abby Day, she always says The most inappropriate stuff.

Let's go in my room Don't hurt me.

Please don't hurt me.

I distract the rabbi while you h*t on his daughter.

And action.

Go.

Ugh.

What a spread, huh? - Terrible.

I agree.

Thank God I have pizza in my car.

Yeah, that's very funny.

What's the matter with you? That wasn't a joke.

Who has pizza in their car? Listen, when I make a joke, you'll know it.

I'm a joke machine.

What are the chances? I love jokes! Oh, good, okay.

Uh Oh, did you hear the one about the waiter? - No.

Walks up to a table full of Jewish women and says, "Ladies, is anything all right?" Hi.

Rack-hael! Baruch ata Ado, nice dress.

Oh, thank you! - Uh, Shabbat sha-hello.

Yeah.

It wasn't as good as mine, but it was cute.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Thanks.

How's Hebrew school? - It's fine.

It's the only place that would hire me after I got out of rehab.

Two Jews walk into a bar.

They buy it.

'Cause they're rich people.

Yeah, they well, these particular Jews happen - to be rich, but they worked hard.

I'm sorry.

Hold on - Telephone call in the middle of a punch line? - Hey.

Generation's the worst! - Hey, what's going on? So Abby's flight is crazy delayed.

Um, so, no time for dinner.

Remember when we used to be best friends? Uh, that was neat.

What a neat time in my life that was.

Hey, Schmidt! My girlfriend's embarrassed of me.

Can we go on that for a little bit? Or does the wingman never get to, you know, flap his wings? The bird never gets to be the main bird.

This.

Ugh! So, I just talked to Nick, and this is a real shame in the pants, but he's not coming home tonight.

What? Why? - He had to hang out with his work friends.

He can't come and see me? - Guess it's just us till the airport.

Mmm.

You see what you're doing, right? Oh, my God.

Mom.

It's a regular chair, man.

Yeah.

Hey, bub.

How you doing? Well, I want to apologize.

Sorry I got distracted.

It's okay.

I'm sorry your girlfriend hates you.

Ah, she doesn't hate me.

She's just ashamed of me or something.

Well, you know what? If she's really ashamed of you, then then she's the stupidest bitch in the whole wide world.

Easy.

Okay, slow down.

I apologize if I went overboard.

Water under the bridge.

I've never been ashamed.

Wish I could have helped you get that girl, man.

Feel like I blew it.

Well, she was kind of nutty.

What happened to us, man? We used to be the best in the biz.

We still are.

I'm the best wingman that's ever wung.

Make a plan? - Absolutely.

You're my brother.

Thank you.

Get your ass in the car.

I'm taking you to the airport.

Thought we could share some calamari.

Now! - Kobe beef sliders? - Now! - Lobster quesadilla? Right now.

This is a great Mmm.

You know, Bertie had a dream she k*lled me.

So, uh, Coach, what's new? Nothing.

Isn't that right, Cece? Hmm? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you'll figure it out.

If not, just text me.

Or don't.

You're good at that.

Oh, my God.

Okay.

We made out once, pointlessly, for two hours.

That's it.

Get over it.

Let it go.

Pointless was it? - Yeah.

I mean, who does that?! Super-hot make out, and then, you ice me out for two months.

What are you talking about?! Ice out what? You text me, "Happy Monday.

" What do I do with that? Oh, I don't know.

Maybe have a happy Monday.

Going out with you was the hottest and dumbest mistake I ever made! It was the hottest, dumbest, sexiest mistake I ever made.

It was so dumb of me to pick you up and press you up against that wall.

So dumb how cool those bricks made my skin feel.

You guys should try the fisherman's bisque.

Has just the right amount of tang.

That tang? - Mm.

That's tang.

Okay.

Whoa! Whoa.

Now what do we do? Maybe just, like, lower your center of gravity, and then this is gonna work.

Just lower it down, I'm gonna clench my thighs.

I'm gonna fall.

I'm gonna fall - I'm clenching my thighs as hard as I can.

Okay, okay.

What? Oh.

Geez.

Oh! - Geez.

That was awful.

That was the worst.

Oh, my gosh.

Wow, what is happening? - Oh, Lord.

Maybe you were right not to text me back, 'cause that was embarrassing.

I'm sorry.

No, that's cool.

Can we just be friends now? You know? Yeah.

I mean, why not? Friends? Friends.

Friends.

Come here, you.

Oh, oh! - Aah! Sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Literally just bit my tooth.

I'm sorry, when I get excited my teeth come out.

Who does that? - Sorry.

I think I broke my tooth.

Let me see? Oh.

Okay.

Go straight to the gate.

Look I get why you're mad at me.

Okay? But if it's any consolation, I'm a woman in my 30s about to get on a plane to go live with my mother.

It's only a matter of time before I have a tiny denim backpack, too.

I said I would never go back to Portland.

So I guess I'm a complete failure.

I'm the baby.

Is this the craziest thing that's going on in the airport? Really? Okay, recap, you h*t the dance floor, and Do what I do best, be an embarrassment.

Well, it's a gift, Nick.

I need you to ruin this bar mitzvah.

What do you say, just get out there and do some weird dancing? - It's got to be bigger than that, man.

Bigger than that? Then I come out there and I knock you out.

It's all right.

Again, it'll be a stage punch.

Don't worry.

I've done several productions of West Side Story.

I know.

You told me.

As a Puerto Rican Shark.

Da, da.

That's cool.

It was awesome.

You never came and saw it, but - Well, I was very busy at that time.

Whatever, never mind.

The rabbi will then come out, he'll thank me, - the hero - Gotcha.

He'll offer me his daughter's hand, then, five years from now, Rachael is pregnant with Elon's little sister and we're having a beautiful family New Year's then in our vacation condo - in the Florida Keys.

You're doing it again, you're talking in speeches.

You've been monologuing, lately, Schmidt.

Do you s Do you, do you hear yourself? - I-I'm unaware of it.

This is why I buy my food from gas stations, Jess.

Nick, you knocked over a wheelbarrow full of fruit, and then you actually skipped away.

Guys, I'm trying to concentrate, okay? The LAPD does not offer entrance exams every single day.

Just Mondays and Fridays.

But I am not waiting till Friday.

Hey, why do you have so much fruit? Because this one ran into his ex-girlfriend at the farmer's market.

Nick? Hey! No way! Caroline of my past.

What a pleasant surprise.

My ex-lover No! I don't deal with exes.

They're part of the past.

You burn 'em swiftly and you give their ashes to Poseidon.

I'm really good friends with Berkley, and we had a terrible breakup Come on, what? You have a good relationship with him because he wants to bone you.

He's a stay-at-home dad.

His entire life revolves around his family.

He's the most emotionally evolved person I know.

And I'm sure his favorite emotion is the emotion of wanting to bone you.

That's not an emotion.

Possible sex is the only reason people stay "friends" with their exes.

Come on.

Back me up, Winnie the Bish.

Yeah, that's true.

I mean, I'm friends with all my exes - See? - families.

Ha-ha! See? I still send Shelby's dad a Father's Day card, and he still sends me five bucks on my birthday.

What is wrong with you? - That's nice.

Hey, guys.

I bet Coach is friends with his exes.

No.

Oh, for sure, yeah.

Yeah! I'm right! - For sex.

No! Ha-ha! I'm right! Can't spell "sex" without the "ex.

" Man, is that sexy when he does that.

Announcement: I finally finished my loft.

Hold the applause.

Let's go.

All right.

Come on.

C-Come on, you guys.

All together, now.

We're not Who's coming? Let's go.

Come on, Nick.

I don't want to go, man.

Thanks for the invite.

Nah, come on.

Winnie.

No? You and Caroline still need some closure.

Well, what do you want me to say? That I walked out on her and now I'm dating you? We started dating, like, a year after you broke up.

Yeah, but that doesn't matter with her.

She's got a crazy streak, and this is bound to set her off.

What if she hurts me physically? What if she hurts me with words? Just talk to her.

Clear the air.

You'll feel better, she'll feel better.

Besides, Nick, I can't give up that farmer's market.

Strolling around, chatting with vendors It's so nice.

I feel like Don Corleone.

I think a lot of ladies do.

Hey.

Hey Sorry about that.

Haven't spoken anybody all day.

Phlegm buildup, you know? I've been cooped up all day in my loft apartment.

So much space for one person, you know? You could scream in there, nobody would ever hear you.

I'm gonna go.

Bye.

What is going on? May I speak plainly with you, Cecilia? I'm in a bit of a sexual drought.

The Good Valley Schmidt hasn't seen rain in months.

You're just you're giving off a creepy vibe.

All right? Living alone is messing up your game and it's making you weird.

Yeah, but I love living alone.

Where are you, grapes? GrÃ¡pÃ©s.

Great apes.

Grapes, we have you surrounded.

Come out with your stems up! I guess my game could be upped if I increased my my human contact - a little bit.

Good.

Because you're caressing your own arm right now.

Hmm.

That's not normal, man.

I've been working out.

It feels I don't I just want to know why you walked out.

Was there something else going on? Was there someone else? Can I just say, I really wish this coffee was a giant beer.

And I wish this scone was a-a whiskey and I could just drink one just chase 'em.

This is nice.

Glad we're doing this.

So how'd it go? We gabbed like a couple of washer women over the back fence.

That's great.

So proud of you.

You two are dating? I knew it.

I knew it was her! What? You didn't tell her we were together?! I told her we were together.

I'm not getting away with this.

I didn't tell her.

Screw you, Miller! I don't understand.

You guys talked for 30 minutes.

How did our relationship not come up? - 'Cause I got scared.

There were so many things that I wanted to tell her.

You ever thought how weird it would be if you just gave up your thumb? You just didn't have a thumb.

I mean, how would you give a thumbs up? Just like this? I think a guy d*ed in the building, 'cause one day in the Dumpster is a bunch of clothes that just fit me.

What I like to do now is take the Underground, yeah? Spend my quid.

Cheers? Oh, crap.

This is her.

She thinks I cheated, Jess.

You know who you should talk to? Berkley.

He's so good at this stuff friendship, closure.

Actually, he did write a book about it.

It's an e-book.

I gave it four stars, but it kind of falls apart at the end.

He goes into God in a way I don't think he needs to.

You know what? I'm gonna text him? Why would I talk to your ex-boyfriend about my ex-girlfriend? Well, you need his help.

You're right.

Give me.

Can I see? - No, no, no.

Can I see? - Yeah.

Yeah.

"Hey, babe" Don't call him "babe.

" It's just what we call each other.

"BF problems"? My boyfriend is having problems.

XOXO? - It's a really common greeting.

"Kissing you, hugging you, kissing you, hugging you"? What else am I gonna write? "O-O-O"? That just looks like "Oh" You're leading him on, Jess.

Oh, Nick.

You are.

Berkley's really gonna teach you a lot.

Men don't talk to people they've dated unless they want sex, or they're Winston.

I also want sex.

Going to Schmidt's.

He's been begging us to all week.

Jess, men are sick.

Look, I'm a relatively good guy, but even I'm a sicko.

Luckily, we have the Internet as a community of Oh, this is terrible! She's quoting scriptures, but using tons of cuss words.

This is as bad as it gets with Caroline.

Okay.

Berkley's around the corner at his baby's world music class.

Okay, you know what? I'm in.

Great.

What kind of beer does Berkley like? - He doesn't.

Oh, great.

I cannot wait to meet him.

Fellas.

You made it.

As promised, here's a coupon for a free sub.

Yup.

Probably get ham.

Wow, man.

It's nice inside of here, man.

Yeah.

It's like a European airport.

Oh, what's that? Uh, you want to watch the game? Which one? Basketball? Football? Of Thrones? Oh! That is awesome, man.

Look at this place, Schmidt.

You got so many plush surfaces.

Well, there are 15 different bang spots in here, each one specifically designated to its own sexual position.

Mm.

That's standing, this is sitting, that's diagonal.

That's how I do it.

The "Why? Why? Because.

" The "Closure of the Lincoln Tunnel.

" The "Red Beanbag Chair.

" Which is pretty obvious, but, you know, that's a good one.

The "Glass Menagerie.

" - The "Bike Share.

" - Nice.

The "Backwards Oops.

" What is "backwards oops"? You don't want to put it mm.

You don't know what it means.

I mean, I don't I've done it, I've done it, but I didn't know I was doing it.

You know, it was Super cool, dude.

I wish I had my own place.

Guys, mi casa es su casa.

I even made you guys keys.

What? Check these out.

That one's yours.

Aw, it looks like a guitar.

Yeah, that's 'cause you're rocking.

Mine's a It's a rainbow kissing a star.

You like it? - Blah! Yeah.

Guys, hang out here anytime you want.

Even now.

Who's thirsty? - Thanks.

Right there.

Dude! - Shut up! - Damn, man.

You're like James Bond.

But I'll be I'll be Moneypenny for sure.

Yeah.

Wait, which one is Moneypenny? It's the woman.

Oh.

So, did the store have that, uh, bamboo highchair you were looking for? No, not the one I wanted.

So I think I'm just gonna Order it online.

You still got it.

You still got it.

Big deal, I've been online, too.

I still got it.

It's different.

So, this is the problem.

Nick didn't tell his ex that we were together, and she found out, and now she's really, really upset.

This is the scariest one yet.

It's just a bunch of smiley faces.

Okay, um, not to be all guy with a baby, but, uh, exes are really a lot like newborns, okay? The burps can be so yucky, but you know what comes after a burp? What? A big old smile.

Aw.

What the hell are you talking about? It was a metaphor, Nick.

It was a classic fatherhood metaphor.

No, my-my point is you just need to face her and let her get it all off her chest.

Oh, I feel like I've done that.

No, you didn't.

You just talked and talked about nothing for 30 minutes.

Okay, look, I know it's hard.

I know that, man.

I'm here and I'm hearing it.

I mean, when Jess and I did this, I think we cried for, like two days? I mean, at least.

But look.

Now I have such a good friend, and we talk all the time, and he's such a good listener.

Say what? I can't hear you.

Is this real? You guys saw each other naked, and now you're friends? Yes, it's the purest form of friendship.

Straight Leno and Eubanks.

I just want to say you're incredible, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life.

Okay, I took your advice.

What do we got? "My bad.

Let's be friends, 'kay?" Smooth, but tough.

That's not good, Nick.

Friendship is a, um it's like a beautiful flower.

You have to nourish it, okay? - You can't just buy it at a store.

All right.

First of all, it was a draft, okay, and I'll fix it.

And second of all, with all due respect, you can buy a flower at a store.

Millered! I know as an angel you usually sleep in heaven, but would you care to spend the evening at my place? I think maybe I would.

Fantastic choice.

Here's my address.

There's usually no place to park.

Well, so where would I? You're a big girl.

You'll figure it out.

Uh, just tr-try south of Sixth.

There's usually a string of open spaces down there.

And there's not a right turn on red on Fifth, just FYI.

Okay, here's the deal.

I've been wanting to end things with Claire for years now.

And I'm gonna do it.

It's gonna take one phone call.

What? - She's gonna burn all my clothes on the lawn.

I don't care.

I only want to wear Henleys anyways.

Jess, we can finally be together.

What?! Wait, no, but leave your wife?! For you.

I'm gonna leave my wife for you.


Wait, what? "Thank you for being so incredible.

" "So lucky to have you in my life"? - Jess.

Mm-mm.

When you said those words, I knew.

No.

Berkley, there's been a fundamental misunderstanding here.

You know the last time Claire thanked me for anything? It was when I was pulling out her chair at our wedding.

No - She doesn't appreciate me like you do.

No, it's not happening.

No, no Aah! Damn it, Winston! Oh, God.

Pretend this is attached, and there's water coming out.

Okay.

No, not like that.

It's not sexual! No! I'm not feeding you water! - Wet my mouth.

No! Oh, hi.

Are you Schmidt's friend? - What? Sch-Schmidt's friend? Where you at? 'Cause I'm ready to ea Hey! My good friend Frank Scabopolis! Ah, give me a hug, you Greek son of a bitch! - Come here! - What? Where is this coming from? You.

The phone calls, the texts, "Boyfriend problems," "I need you," hugs, kisses.

What? - More hugs, more kisses.

I - You have been setting up dominoes for ten years.

And now they are falling.

You have a baby, sir! I know.

And you are gonna make such a good stepmom.

I love you, Jessica.

God, it feels good to say that out loud and not just to my sleeping wife.

Guys, I need your help.

You, hey! Nick was right about you, and he can't know that, - so put a sock in it! - What is wrong with me? - Hi.

Hey.

I keep trying to write to Caroline, but I'm choking.

I can't get past "What's up, C?" Oh, that's her.

It says, "Come to the window, friend.

" Friend.

That's good.

That's good.

That's a good thing.

Yeah.

Caroline! Hey! You cheat on me and then you want to be friends?! I'm just writing you an e-mail! It's-it's not sending! Look, gonna throw it down, but I need my phone back! - We talk now! - Caroline! Hey! Stop! Really excited to - No! - talk to you guys.

Hey, stop! That's not my car! Tell Jess I said hi.

No, Caroline, I parked down the street! It Why am I telling you?! At least she can't get into the building.

Okay, what am I gonna do here? She cut off the power.

No, Nick, that was you.

You turned off the light.

All the other lights are still on.

My bad.

Thank you.

I know you're scared.

Let me be brave.

You should go because you have a wife, and you have a baby, and you love them.

Jess, what are you, crazy? It's not safe out there.

Berkley can't go.

He stays here.

I don't think that - Thank you, Nick.

You're very welcome.

I'll be with you in just one second, all right? - Mm-hmm.

And don't drink the water by the bed.

It's got my contacts in it.

Okay.

What are you doing? - What are you doing? - And t-tell her that I'd like to be reimbursed for those strawberries.

What? Dude.

Why is she calling you Schmidt? I told her my name was Schmidt in case we saw your mail.

I don't just leave mail out.

This isn't a small business.

Get out.

Dude, I'm about to seal the deal.

I'm not getting out.

I'm about to I'm-I'm a deal sealer.

I'm about to get some squish, dude, and you need to not get in between that.

I'm about to nail it into the wall.

Dude, I'm about to take down that va-dragon.

I'm about to pin the tail on the va-donkey, dude.

You better not stand in the way of this.

Don't call her a va-donkey.

I don't even know her well and I want her to leave, but please don't call her - a va-d va-donkey.

I won't.

All right.

Please.

I need this.

Okay, fine.

I will use the guest room.

Yes.

Like an animal.

Oh, yes.

Oh! Winston! What are you doing?! Oh, we were just playing a game.

You know, Bad Cop, Black Cop? It's me, Bertie! Um, I might have been wrong about some things, um, some Berkley things.

Hey, the screaming stopped.

I knew she'd run out of gas.

"My bad"?! - What? "Let's be friends, 'kay"?! You couldn't even write out "okay"?! It's go time, Nick.

Time to break out that burp cloth.

Jess, let's give him some space by going to a motel.

I don't love you.

I got a slight beer buzz.

Let's do it.

Yeah, don't go.

I thought you wanted me to talk to her.

Don't go right now.

I'm sorry.

You don't love me? Say it again? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Oh What?! Then why have you led me on for ten years? Oh, hell on Earth no! Oh, my God, I was right.

He wants to bone you.

Oh, come on, Nick! Caroline, I'll be right there.

I'm so sorry, Berkley.

You got cut off.

Thank you, sir.

No.

May, 2004.

You brushed my hand at Dave Matthews concert - during "Two Step.

" - "Two Step"? - Oh, my God.

Or that time that I helped you move, and I came over, I was wearing sweatpants.

You couldn't stop staring at my rig.

She loves looking at rigs.

Why are you calling it a rig?! You're doing it again.

One second, Caroline! Open this door! You think I wear this sweater because I like it? It's a handsome sweater.

That's right, I love you.

No! What do you mean, no? Ooh! Open the door! Come on! Schmidt? You said to me that I was incredible and you were so lucky, and now here we are, we're trying to hook up Nick with his ex-girlfriend.

I mean, that's what this is, right? No, it isn't.

That's not what So let's just do it, come on.

Hey, hey, - Berkley, Berkley! - Oh, no! - No, no! - No, what are you doing? - Oh, no.

'Kay! - Oh, hey! - Car-o-line.

Yeah You stole my boyfriend.

Schmidt? Be right there! That should buy us some time.

Coach, you stay with your girl who thinks that you're me in my bedroom.

Winston, you stay in the guest room with Bertie doing whatever the hell it is you guys are doing.

Gross.

I'm gonna keep Sarah Almost there! I'm gonna keep Sarah in the living room, using one of the living-dining-open-floor-plan bang spots.

Now, no exits, no entrances, no Noises Off baloney.

Capeesh? Confirm my capeesh! Capeesh! - Let's go.

Do it.

All right.

Guys, guys! - Right.

This is the exact type of baloney that I'm talking about.

Unbelievable.

Guys, guys! I'm really glad that we're doing this.

Okay.

All right.

I did not steal your boyfriend.

Timeline.

Now.

Okay, um you and Nick break up.

London has a great Olympics.

Uh-oh, trouble in Syria.

Board up your windows.

Superstorm Sandy.

Hey, over here.

Me and Nick get together.

And here's that beautiful Sunday in the park that you and I went to, and we have a wonderful Sunday.

Shut up, Berkley! - No, you shut up, Jess.

Don't take this out on Jess.

Oh, oh, right, it's the beginning, so you're being all supportive now.

He's still trying.

I mean, I bet he's still laughing at all your jokes, right? Well I have a great instinct for comedy.

All right, well, you know what, you enjoy all that while it lasts, because I'll tell you what.

It's not gonna be long before he stops holding your hand and starts high-fiving you and he stops letting you be the little spoon and he starts drifting off during important conversations.

Are you listening right now? What's that? - Seriously, Nick? - Jess, you're the girlfriend now, but one day you're gonna be the ex.

And two years after he breaks up with you, he still won't tell you why.

Um, okay, well, um this has been a really, um, neat talk, so, um I'm gonna go sit in the shower, and, um, go over the greatest hits in my mind.

I'll just be right here, picturing the whole sudsy thing.

Hey, hey, ho, I'm right here.

How about a little respect? I know.

What, you This is obviously happening.

No, it's not! Where's your brain? Hey, Jess, you okay? No.

This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

I've led a very fortunate life.

Look, Jess, you were right.

No, you were right.

I feel like such a fool.

You were right about everything.

No, I wasn't.

Caroline deserves to know why I left.

And you should hear, too.

I'm thirsty! Stop! Let me go, boy! - No, no, no, come, come Whoa! Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? Schmidt.

What? Frank Scabopolis is up in here making out with some bitch.

That's not necessary.

I mean Who's Frank Scabopolis? Aren't you Schmidt?! I-I am Schmidt.

I thought you were Schmidt.

I am Schmidt.

Uh Uh, w-we're brothers.

We are, we're-we're brothers.

What an upbringing that was.

Yeah, same mom, different dads.

One browner.

Then who the hell is Frank Scabopolis? Yeah.

I am Frank Scabopolis! Is this helping, Schmidt? I forgot the plan.

Winston, please shut up.

Plan? What plan?! I there's no plan.

I know nothing about a plan.

Is this some little nasty group sex games y'all got going on up in here? Been a couple years, but I'm down.

I didn't want to know that.

I am out of here.

I'm way ahead of you.

No, no, please! Sarah, please, wait! I can ugh.

Just Well, I'm gonna go back to bed.

Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.

It's pretty good.

See? You don't think I'm scary, do you, baby? - Oh, whoa! - Oh! No.

Hey, no.

I was just kidding.

No.

Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.

Nick, you don't have to do this.

No, I-I do.

Look, I never cheated on you, but I might as well have.

See, I fell in love with Jess the moment she walked through the door.

Boo! - Really? Sorry.

The moment I walked through the door? Really? 'Cause I thought I annoyed you.

Can we do this later, please? - It's just not a good - Yeah, okay.

Got it, yup.

Got it.

Caroline, she's the reason that I left.

I always thought that it was Jess.

I'm glad I'm not crazy.

Well Hmm.

Thanks for telling me the truth.

Oh, I'm just sorry it didn't happen sooner.

Don't touch me.

I'm so sorry.

I was kidding.

There's that famous Milwaukee humor.

I'm not from Milwaukee.

You honestly scare me.

Good-bye, Nick.

Bye.

Hey.

Look, Berkley, um, I'm so sorry that you got the wrong idea about us.

You were right.

I did play some part in it.

Thank you.

Good luck, Jessica.

Thanks.

See you later, bud.

I really don't want to go back to my wife.

Do you guys want to play cards or something - Go.

Just go.

Get out of here.

The moment I walked through that door, huh? Just be cool about it.

'Cause for me, it was way later.

Yeah, I know.

Like, a lot later Oh, come here already.

You could use that for something.

That's the "Glass Menagerie.

" - Yeah.

I'll sit her down right on top of that.

Oh, absolutely.

The, uh, "Star 68.

" Where's that at? - Right there on that pillow.

Oh.

Wow.

The "Jumanji.

" Yeah, you do the the "U Lock" on here.

That'd be cool.

The "Jean-Michel Basquiat.

" Oh, okay.

The "Fabric Softener.

" That's the "Kansas City Shaker.

" - This, right here? I like that.

Yeah.

Back there, that's the "Nia Vardalos.

" - Ooh.

That's nice, dude.

Nice.

That one's "Sex on the Rug," which is and, again, it's pretty obvious.

But that's you know, why mess with a classic?

All right!

Yes!

Don't touch my shin every time there's a big play.

Yeah, no, I got it.

Oh, yes! - Don't touch it every time! Hey, man, stop.

Oh! - Oh! There it is! - No! - Hey, Nick.

Um, Jess left her panties in the dryer.

You mind if I move 'em? - Sure, man, I don't care.

Wait a second.

Why do you ask? You're not gonna move them in a weird way or something, are you? No, dude, I'm just trying to be respectful, that's all.

You know, before you and Jess were together, I moved her panties hundreds of times, so - Wait, what? - Hundreds of times? What, are you just hanging around the-the dryer like some sort of panty-hawk? - What? - Panty-hawk.

I'd watch that show.

So should I just go move them, or Nick, he's being weird.

You gotta move 'em.

Oh, so now I'm the panty mover? Yeah, you're the boyfriend.

That's not a life! - Who the hell is gonna move the panties? Coach, you move 'em.

Are they warm from the dryer? You know what? You're out.

Grow up.

I'll move the panties.

Thank you.

Ooh, seems awfully eager.

Yeah, you're awfully eager, here, Schmidt.

Oh, yeah.

I been waiting my entire life to move your girlfriend's panties Stop saying "panties," bro.

Panties.

No, they're panties.

With a "D.

" Pandies.

Pandies.

Say "panties" like a normal person.

No, this is how black people say it.

Pull your "pannies" down.

No "T" in there.

We say "pannies.

" Yeah.

Here's how a white dude says it.

Pull your panties down.

Guys, honestly, can you not see what the panties are doing to us? Stop saying "panties" when it comes to Jess, everybody.

This is exactly why none of us should live with a woman.

I've got an idea.

You guys are never gonna believe what You know what? I don't care.

The most amazing thing just happened.

Whoa! Hey! - Hey! - Watch where you're going! - Oh, boy.

Sorry.

Sorry, my bad.

We thought we were gonna die, but she was actually really sorry.

So she invited us to a party at her boss's house, and they're sending a limo, and guess who her boss is.

It's Prince! - It's Prince! - It's Prince.

It's Prince.

Prince! It's Prince! - What? - Oh! Prince? - Nice! We're going to a party at Prince's house, - We're going to a party - We're going! at Prince's house.

We're going! That's not my underwear.

Which shoes should I wear to Prince's house, white or black? White, or black? Nick, come on.

The limo's gonna be here any minute.

Which shoe? White or black? Well, I think you look great in everything.

I just want this moment to end.

What are your open-toe options? None of it works, okay? We gotta start over.

Let's go.

You failed, bro.

Man, I am glad I'm not going to that party.

Too much pressure, am I right? Dude, in high school, going to a Prince party would've been your dream come true.

You were obsessed.

So tonight we're gonna party Like it's 1999! My mother had to cut those pants off me, they were so tight.

Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to celebrate this thing called Schmidt.

Nick, are you wearing cargo pants? - Yeah.

You're gonna wear those to an A-list party? Hey, guys, how are we going to transport all this cargo? Oh, wait, we have Nick's pants.

We're saved.

Get the frickin' pants off.

Dude, we're not going.

Prince invited the hot girls, not the four dudes.

What? Why did I buy this $2,000 suit? You idiot! Dude, my suit cost $200, and mine came with socks stapled to the lapel.

Not gonna tap that.

I'm not gonna 'Cause it came with it.

Cheap suit.

Yeah, but it came with socks.

Unacceptable! This party was supposed to take me to the next level.

Next level of what? - Don't ask, man.

In every man's life, there is one party that changes everything.

Oh.

You don't understand.

And that is exactly why I'm leaving you all behind.

So this whole time, you've just been waiting for cooler friends? Yes.

Of course.

Coach, look around.

This can't be the finish line.

Here she is.

Whoa! You look great! Why is Schmidt dressed up? I don't want to talk about it.

Prince! Unbelievable! Hey, look! I'm in a limo! I wish I had really long legs so I could stretch 'em out the length of the limo.

Well, have fun.

I love you.

Hmm Mm-hmm.

Did Nick just tell me - he loved me for the first time? - Yeah.

And did I do finger g*n back? Yeah, you did.

No - Yes.

Oh You're gonna want to drink all of this.

Oh, oh! - Hey, driver, we're gonna need some more champagne! Ah.

Okay.

So Yeah Dude, a man never says it first, okay? Well, it wasn't my plan to tell her, it just slipped out.

She looked so pretty.

Well, Nick, is that how you feel? I mean, do you love her? Of course I do.

But I wasn't gonna say it like that.

I was gonna wait, Winston.

You blurted it out.

It's not a big deal.

That's what I always do.

I love you! Sometimes they say it back, sometimes they don't I mean, it's like a numbers game.

I always do this.

I always get too intent, and then I freak girls out.

I blew it.

What do I do? Well, Nick, you can't take it back.

Well, that's not 100% true.

Damn! Prince's house! Not bad, Prince! You think Prince has a pool? You think he has a drawbridge? We're never gonna get in.

We're not even in a limo.

Uh, excuse me, we're in a Ford Fusion, the best car ever made.

It gets double the gas mileage of - Again? - Shut up.

That's all you've been talking about the whole drive, and it's weird.

You get sexual when you talk about it.

It's in your eyes.

I don't like it.

Double the gas mileage means you go double as far.

Double as long.

Shut up! I'll let you borrow this, dude, and you'll feel it.

You'll know what I'm talking - Why don't I feel it right now? - Feel it.

Oh, cowabunga! - You felt it? - I'm gonna punch you in the face.

Just drive the car.

You've never been turned on by gas mileage before? - Never.

No! - Once.

When was that? - It was a Thursday, that's all I remember.

A Thursday? - Yeah.

Just drive the car.

I gotta go tell my girlfriend I don't love her - so she doesn't leave me.

All right.

Like a normal person.

Amazing.

Can you believe it? No, I can't.

Finger g*n? That was so stupid.

My brain just froze.

If the limo guy hadn't pulled away, I probably would've done a lasso.

I think you were just a little scared.

Scared of what? Saying "I love you"? I say "I love you" all the time.

I'll say it right now: I love you! I love you.

Hi, I'm Clayton Kershaw.

I'm a Los Angeles Dodger.

Yeah, and I'm Jessica Day.

I'm a Los Angeles astronaut.

Not now, pal.

He's never gonna let us in.

So what do we do? Pull it together.

I need this as much as you do.

My new life is waiting for me in that party.

Guys, look, I can't help but think that now might be a good time for a little f*re and Ice.

Oh! f*re and Ice! - Please, do not There is never - a good time for f*re and Ice.

Yes! Yeah! f*re and Ice got you into parties in college, but it's not getting you into Prince's house.

Winston, what happens when you mix f*re and ice? Warm water, baby.

This is embarrassing.

It's bubbling.

It's bubbling, baby! - Warm water! - Warm water! - Warm water! - Warm water! Um, yeah, I'm on the list.

Ernie! Winnie?! Winston L.

Bishop.

Ernie, is that really you? Oh, my goodness! Come here, man! My God, it's so good to see you! This guy saved my life, man.

No, you saved my life.

Let me ask you something, man.

You still keep in contact with Freddy? Freddy didn't make it.

Freddy's gone? No! Come on! No! No, man! - We ain't crying.

No, you cry, I cry.

This is a great night.

Hope nothing ruins it.

That's nice to see.

Come on, you guys.

For Freddy.

For Freddy.

That's remarkable.

That worked? We need our own f*re and Ice, pal.

Well, all right, man.

Ham and Cheese! I don't really think the name made a Ham and Cheese! - Nick! Well, we should rehearse! - Excuse me.

Excuse me! - What?! Who's this guy? - Nick Miller? - Is that Schmidt? - You scoundrel, you.

Well, hot damn.

Come here.

It's good to see you.

Yeah, well, the feeling's not mutual! The last time I saw him, I was on the desert, and he was putting my mother into a prison.

You don't understand what we're doing, do you? Keep this animal away from me! You know what? It's my fault.

We didn't rehearse.

We didn't rehearse.

Can we come into the party? You know what? We're gonna wait back here.

I get it.

It's my fault.

It's - Nick? - I'm Trojan horsing inside a bunch of models.

Every ham for himself.

No, Nick! Let me in there! Models, let me in, please.

No, sir.

Unhand me!


Jess? Hey, there you are.

Excuse me.

Jess.

Nick, hi! What are you doing here?! - I'm so happy to see you! - Yeah.

How'd you get in? - I need to talk to you.

I know.

I can't leave it the way that was.

I know, because there's something, um, I really should have said back there and I didn't, and, um I think it's important that I say to you.

So, uh, what I wanted to say is, Nick Miller I Jess! She's all right.

Hey, Jess, you okay? Hi.

What happened? You had a panic att*ck and you fell down.

Oh, my God Which is actually worse than finger g*n.

I didn't think that was possible.

I think it's fair to say that I did not handle the situation very well.

No, look, it's fine.

In fact, I want to take the whole thing back, Jess.

What? I shouldn't have said it, it was an accident and, uh yeah, so just kind of clear the air.

No! No, Nick! This just got very awkward.

Be strong, Nick! What did? What? - What's that? - I'm outside the hedge! You see my arm? I'm trying to push through! What are you doing up there? Be careful! I lost my bearings! I had to go high to avoid the spiders! - Nick - Just wait for him to finish.

I'm breaching! - Uh - Whoa! Easy! Easy! Aah! Aah! Oh! Prince is terrible at Frisbee.

There's, like, ten of these things up there.

Hey, guys, can I talk to Nick alone for a second? You got it.

Yeah.

You're taking it back? Is that how you really feel? Well how do you feel? Hi.

I'm Prince.

So what seems to be the problem? Oh, how rude of me.

I haven't given you enough time to freak out yet.

You may do so now.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nick! So, I'm not familiar with this term "finger g*n.

" Can you elaborate? Uh, yeah, it's a Whoa.

Don't point those at me.

They might go off.

That was very much of your flavor of humor.

Listen, Nick, uh Nick, right? Yes, that's my name.

Jess and I are gonna take a moment to just be alone.

I'm-I'm not worried, but why? What are you gonna talk to her about? You.

Nick, I never thought I'd say this, but I need to be alone with Prince.

All right, well Yeah.

So, do you like pancakes? Ooh, ooh.

Cece, help! The bouncer's after me.

Oh, all right.

Okay.

He's gone.

He's gone, Schmidt.

Is he gone? - Mm-hmm.

You can stop now.

He's tenacious.

He's definitely gonna be back.

Pretty sure it's all clear.

It's always good to see old friends.

Thank you.

So, tonight's the night we're just gonna leave this all behind and get cooler friends, right? Yeah, right.

We should be d*ad.

We should be d*ad.

I never thought I was gonna see him again! He's getting emotional right now, because this is real.

Oh, if you cry, I'm gonna cry.

And then I'm gonna cry, then we can just cry together.

Poor Freddy.

Jess is with Prince! And I've been drinking.

Wait Jess is with Prince? And I've been drinking.

Who are these two? Come on, man.

f*re and Ice, dude.

Get out.

It's getting warm in here isn't it? - Yes.

It's actually a little chilly.

We're Oh, give me a break.

I see what you're doing.

Mm-mm.

You're trying to tempt me sexually.

Not interested.

What are you doing, Nick? That leads to me taking my jacket off, and all of a sudden, you guys got me in my underwear, huh? I'm not a dummy.

Take a walk.

No one's interested.

So rude.

How idiotic.

We got business.

Rude? No, no, no, no, no, no, stay, stay, stay.

Let's go.

Idiot! Yeah, I'm an idiot.

Ciao.

No, no, no ciao! No ciao.

You'll be replaced by robots before you can say, "Fragi-cava-licious.

" You're bringing f*re and Ice down! Yeah, man.

You don't bring f*re and Ice down.

Don't start with me right now.

I'm having a terrible day.

Who cares about them? Who cares? I care! I feel like dancing right now.

Dancing's not the answer.

You can't dance.

It's only gonna get worse.

Let's tear the roof off this joint, and show Prince how we do! Thanks, Charles.

You want to know why you can't tell that nice dude you love him? I want to say it, but You're scared.

Exactly.

If you say it and things don't work out, what then? I really care for him.

And I'm just worried I'm gonna lose him.

That's stupid.

You're stupid.

I forgive you.

Oh, my God, thank God! - Besides anything beautiful is worth getting hurt for.

Well, that's very well put.

You know who said that? No.

Me.

You're good.

God.

I wish I were more like you, Prince.

Finish your pancake.

Let's get to work.

Oh, it's really good.

But I'm super full.

Pancake.

Okay.

Here, put this on.

Oh, that's beautiful, but I don't think I could pull that off.

Don't argue with me.

Okay.

Repeat after me.

Love.

Do you understand now? Yes, I think I do.

What about now? No.

No.

Look in there.

Wait, stop, no! I'm afraid of the dark! I said stop being afraid.

Boo.

Yeah! This is what sexy is! So, what do you think? I think you need to go find Nick.

I don't know how to thank you.

Shh.

I honestly didn't hear a word you said.

Okay.

Okay, gotcha.

This is your party now.

To the VIP room? - Yeah.

With the two of you? You can't handle it! You can't b*at me! Come on.

You've got it.

Boy, you don't got it.

You can't do it.

You're gonna do it.

Three - You can't do it.

Two - He's gonna do it! Come on, now, you can get it.

That's impressive.

New record.

Surrounded by celebrities and millionaires, and you dingbats are playing Lemon Mouth.

Rind me, woman.

Really? - Okay, here we go.

Let's do it.

All right, let's go.

Let's get this party started.

You got the time, Winston.

Check this out.

All right, let's go.

Here we go: Ten, nine, - What are you doing? - eight What are you doing? Boom! - What?! - You're not supposed to eat the lemon.

New record.

That's not even the game! Nick Miller! Hey, Jess.

I'm not sorry that I said it.

I hate to say this, but I couldn't hear you 'cause it's very loud.

I love you! I love you, Nick Miller! What the hell are you wearing? Prince dressed me.

Awesome! Yeah! Anybody want to fall in love tonight? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Fall in love tonight She said Special night, my favorite tune The moon thr*at to dance her out of her shoes Out of my shoes In his ear was about to hear An awful thought he could not refuse She said - Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight She said Underneath the taffeta There ain't no better hiding place Hiding place If I see the moon, I'll just laugh it up Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah - Want to wake up - Wake up To your, your pretty face - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight?

Oh, yeah.

So we just danced with Prince? - With Prince.

Yeah.

That's right.

That was fun.

Jess, how did you know the words? I think Prince is magic.

I've always thought Prince was magic.

Where do we go from here? How do we move on from this? Just go to work tomorrow? Wait a minute.

Where's Cece? - I'll take it easy on you.

Thank you.

That's so cute! Bum, bum, bum! Birthday Eve Cocktail.

Oh, my God.

You're my favorite bartender.

Thank you! Oh, my God.

What is that? Is it not good? I'm still learning how to make drinks.

I'm better at sh*ts.

Want a birthday sh*t? I think I'm good.

So, any special birthday plans? No, she's just gonna go to the movies alone, as usual.

No, I'm not, actually.

Uh, this year Nick asked me to spend the day with him.

That's so sweet.

I mean, what are you gonna do? Something special? Maybe.

You know, whatever Nick wants to do.

I'm not really a birthday person.

Please.

I do have a lot of expectations for people.

Happy birthday.

Oh, my God.

"Made in China"?! Are you taking me to China?! And that's why, a long time ago, I decided that I would spend my birthday alone at the movies.

It's just safer, you know? No getting your hopes up, no getting let down.

Well, I know how you feel about movies.

I mean, my parents took me to see Witness and then they never came back.

What? - I can really quote that movie though.

"Be careful out among them English.

" But enough about me! I am talking your ear off, lady, and it's your birthday.

This year's gonna be different.

Maybe Nick has something big planned, maybe not.

I'm gonna be chill.

No expectations.

Low maintenance.

No maintenance.

I'm just gonna be one of those cool girlfriends, like in the movies.

She just, like, has bed head and she wears, like, men's shirts and she's just like, "Yeah, cool.

"I'll wear, like, men's shirts and, like, sneakers and stuff.

And, like, I don't care about how I look.

" Hey.

Hey.

She has no idea about the party.

Uh, Winston's STD-free.

Whew! It was a close call.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Close call, y'all.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

Do you guys know how hard it's been for me to keep this party a secret? Nick, it's been an inspiration, and that's why we're gonna help you cross that finish line, okay? This is our Rudy.

Very condescending but thank you.

Right on.

All right, team check-in.

Coach, where we at with decorations? - I forgot.

Wait, what? Psych! I'm the best at stuff.

I don't forget stuff.

First place! Wait.

Why are you first place? I dominated on cake patrol.

And thank you for getting that cake.

You don't have to add the "patrol.

" Decorations beats cake.

Uh, no.

Cake definitely beats decorations.

Oh, really? Let's do a word association game, okay? - Yeah.

I'm in, I'm in.

Birthday.

Decorations.

Wait, what'd I say? Okay, Schmidt, are you ready to transport all electronics to the party venue? By "electronics," you mean this itty-bitty flash drive that I can fit in my pocket and that is light as air? I need a verbal confirmation.

You insult me.

Yes.

Cece, you ready to cover my shift tomorrow with Mike? Born ready.

Yes.

Oh.

You're giving your Saturday to Cece? That's cool.

That's really wonderful.

Can you tell I'm being sarcastic? - Absolutely.

Yeah, it's pretty clear.

I'm ready.

You set f*re to soda water.

Who does that? How do you even possibly do that? It's not a flammable thing.

It's not even Are you a witch? Mike I hate all of you hipsters so much Okay, and I'm gonna be on Jess Watch.

I'm gonna make sure she doesn't see anything that will ruin the surprise of this party that has taken everything from me, emotionally and physically and financially.

So what do you have planned for the day? A big surprise party.

Next.

Right, but before then.

The party's at 7:00.

What do you have planned b-before that? - Wait - Nick, you need a plan, okay? I don't care what Jess says.

She's going to expect something.

I have to plan a birthday before the birthday? The whole day is the birthday.

This is a very big deal.

This is your first birthday together as a couple.

All right, you know what? It's gonna be okay.

It's her birthday.

That girl's gonna want to sleep in.

My day is not starting till noon.

This is the time I was born.

I'm wide awake.

It's my birthday.

My day started earlier than I thought.

I got to slow down breakfast.

What's going on with you guys? Nick, first of all, blessings.

Um, second of all, there may have been a possible mix-up with the cake.

Possibly.

"See You in Hell, Boomer"? Oh, my God What part of you thought this was Jess's cake? I thought it was an inside joke.

I'll do the cake.

No, I am the cake patrol.

Both of you do the cake.

I'm considering this problem solved.

Hey, speaking of problems, do you want me to go check up on Cece at the bar today? I don't think that's necessary.

All right, I'll do it.

But you owe me one, bro.

I need to make a 90-minute omelet.

I love my birthday breakfast.

I can't believe you were gonna make this all yourself.

It would've taken you hours.

I know.

And with your help, it took six minutes.

I know.

I'm so fast.

What do you say we go into my bedroom and, uh, slow things down? Ooh.

Wow.

That's the fastest it's ever taken.

I know.

You just look very pretty.

So, you want to take a long nap? Oh.

Um If that's what you have planned, then, yes, let's take a long nap.

Perfect.

Maybe for, like, six, seven hours? Hmm It's just such a nice day outside Yeah.

Um, so let's take, uh let's take this party outside.

Sure.

Next up on the agenda is it's lunch.

It's 8:30 in the morning.

Oh, my God, it's so early.

What are you doing here, Schmidt? Nick thought you might need some help.

Yeah, well, I don't, okay? So you can go.

Maybe I'll just stay for a little bit.

Double-tap some Insta-G's.

Okay.

Oh, hey, Mike.

I cleaned the glasses.

Oh, wow, a bunch of broken glass in the ice tub.

That'll be fun for me to clean up.

I'm sorry.

Um I'm not gonna cover for you like Nick does, okay? I promise you that.

And don't make eyes at me because it's not gonna work because I'm super gay.

When I look at you, I just see You know, it's fine, but it's bumpy, it's creepy.

Eh.

Doesn't do anything.

It's like looking at this, it's like a it's-it's-it's-it's-it's it's not o it's not a good it's not good.

Okay.

This, all this, everything you got, eh.

Three out of six.

Damn shame about that cake, Winston.

Looks like someone dominated their party task.

"Coach, where are all the kazoos?" All over your face.

I'll pick those up.

Or maybe in my spare time I'll make a cake.

Just back off, Coach.

What's up, Nick? - How's the cake situation? - Cake's good.

Can I just see the phone? - Can I see the phone really quick? Got it.

Dude, get Hey.

Cake's good, man.

I'm on top of it.

So, how's your plan working out? Okay, I have no plan.

I'm just winging it, okay? I panicked and took her to a drugstore.

She's getting a free diabetes test.

I don't know where to take her.

Is it safe to bring her home? - Hey.

Oh! The birthday girl! I got the test.

My blood sugar is normal.

Already? You did that all that already? - Yeah.

Birthday girl gets, all your favorite Next activity.

I see what you're trying to do here, man.

You're trying to show me up.

What are you talking about, Bish? I'm referring to basketball.

When we used to play back in the day, no matter how open I was, you never passed me the ball, you never let me sh**t.

You just couldn't stand to let me shine.

Your nostrils are flaring so much right now, it's distracting.

I'm done letting you run the court.

I'm building my own court.

And it's gonna be bigger and yummier than yours.

Are you challenging me to a bake-off, Bish? Yes, I am challenging you to a bake-off.

Okay.

Well, then, I'll do the countdown.

You know what? I'll do the countdown then.

The countdown begins when this timer goes off.

You set the timer for 20 minutes.

I'm gonna make a cake so moist, girls are gonna be, like, "Ew.

Why do you say moist? I hate that word.

" I'm gonna be, like, "Just taste the cake.

" And they're gonna be, like, "Damn, it's moist!" And - Bake! - Okay, bake! - I said it first.

I said it first.

I said it first.

I said it first.

A customer ordered an old-fashioned, and she got gin in a mug with a peanut in it.

I'll fix it.

Make me an old-fashioned right now, or I'm gonna call the manager.

And I want to talk to him anyway, because he's just gorgeous.

I want to be a barnacle on his ship.

Just hanging on by my mouth, getting all the nutrients I need.

Okay, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned.

If it's old-fashioned, it probably has something like - absinthe - Oh, the old-fashioned.

One of my favorite drinks; a classic cocktail.

Just a half ounce of simple syrup.

Splash of water, two dashes of bitters.

Mix that up with some ice.

And then, you know my personal favorite.

You know, and just, far be it from me, but the bourbon whiskey.

Bourbon.

Two ounces of bourbon whiskey.

No.

Hmm.

It's not the Scotch whiskey.

It's No, it's certainly not the vermouth.

Vermouth would be insane.

Yes, the bourbon whiskey.

My favorite.

Wonderful.

Look at that.

Old-fashioned.

Hmm.

Old-fashioned?

Oh, my stars and garters, you made a drink.

Holy crud.

Yes, Nick! I have the electronics! Do you know any, like, time-consuming and free activities in Griffith Park? Gross! su1c1de? Schmidt, please.

I need some a Well, just figure it out, dude!

Oh, it's my mom.


Okay, um, found the biggest rock I could carry.

It was this one.

Um - It's heavy.

It's huge.

Yeah, heavy.

Oh, my God.

Um what are we doing here? It's not that I'm not having fun, 'cause I am.

It's okay if you didn't plan anything for my birthday.

Are you kidding?! Really, Nick.

Not only did I plan something, but my plan's about to blow your mind.

Honestly.

You need to trust me a little bit.

'Cause everything is about to be made very clear - very soon.

Oh, my God! What? Nick! - You're the best.

I'm amazing.

I'm so surprised! - I'm so surprised.

This is amazing! - It's amazing! - This is amazing! Yay! - Oh, son of a bitch! - Oh! - Don't touch anything! - It'll ruin the surprise! Yeah.

Yay! - Yes.

Yeah! - Yay! - Hey, Jess, let's get out of here - before anything ruins this perfect moment.

Ooh! I wouldn't t Wait because we've got a whole, uh, ceremony.

No! That lady took my birthday! What is happening? - Jess! Look, look, I'm sorry, Jess.

No, no, no, Nick, I just I don't know why I get so crazy about birthdays.

You know, it's crazy, 'cause you had a very fun day put together.

Eggs and sex and and a really long uphill walk.

And, um look, um, that's amazing for you, you know? For me? You're not a guy who plans things.

Maybe I am.

Look every day, you show me, in your own way, how you care about me.

Like when you pick up rubber bands on the sidewalk.

For your ponytail.

I could not be more fine.

I'm super chill.

I'm just gonna go home for a second.

Bye.

Jess, let's keep Jess! Don't follow me.

Sure you know how to tap a keg? - How hard could it be? It's beer, for crying out loud.

It's the drink of idiots.

Wait.

Nick told me something about - Cece, look, I got I got it.

Ooh, there's a knob back here.

I got it in.

He told me if I turn this, I shoulde able to - Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, no! - Turn it off! - Oh, sorry! It's just - Turn it off! Oh.

You butt hole.

You can't do anything right, can you? I'm so sorry.

He's right, though.

I can't do anything.

No skills.

I told you this, but I didn't even graduate high school.

A lot of people never graduated high school.

Okay-- Einstein, Bill Gates, Anne Frank.

I'm gonna take back that last one.

Why did I think that I could bartend? Because you can.

You are strong, and you are confident.

Those are skills.

Use them.

And be a little bit meaner to the people here.

It should be easy for you.

Just pretend that they're me.

You're right.

That is easy.

And pull your shirt down a little bit.

This isn't a monastery.

Do not push your luck with me.

I'll look away.

You're wearing paper towels.

Behind! No it's an environmental-friendly, recyclable apron.

Behind! Behind! - Okay, real really? Okay.

Behind.

Behind.

Behind! - Behind! Behind.

Whoa! Behind! - Behind you! Behind! - Behind! Behind! - Oh, so you - Behind! - Behind! - Whoa! Behind.

In front.

Behind.

What's this? It's Jess! - Oh, my God.

I mean, it's Jess! Hey! What's up, girl? What you - doing home? - I'm great.

I'm great.

Hide the cake.

Hide the - I'm great.

Behind.

How's your day going? Going good? - You're crying? - Oh.

I'm taking - Um - I got mine off first.

No, you didn't.

Rest up over here.

What a day, guys.

Really long, huh? - Yeah.

Bet you had a long day, huh? I'm really fine.

It had a real day, you know.

I'm disappointed in Nick.

Yeah, you got to let that out, you know, 'cause But I'm disappointed in myself because I'm disappointed in Nick, you know.

Oh, I feel you.

Yeah, that's messed up.

Yeah, let it out.

Let it out.

I'm getting up.

Oh! Jess - No, no, no Hey.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Want you to close your eyes, breathe deep, and go to the most magical place on earth-- your imagination.

Have you guys been baking? Ah, nah.

Bakery downtown exploded.

Don't look into it.

It's not on the Internet.

Yeah.

She is here.

What happened? She doesn't think I can do anything or plan anything, and it feels like crap.

Maybe she's right.

Why did I think I could pull this off? I'm pretty sure I'm having a heart att*ck.

And I haven't arranged for anybody to clear my Internet history.

I wasn't building a b*mb! I was just curious.

Nick, you got a whole team of friends pulling for you, okay? Just get yourself home.

You can still pull this off.

Hey, Mike.

-What? - So I cleaned out the beer trap, I polished all these wine glasses, and I turned that penis graffiti in the bathroom into a whimsical hat.

Now my friend and I have to go to a party.

All right, Schmidt, let's go.

You called me your friend.

Did I? And now, look, no matter what we see in here, I just want you to know that it's been an honor working with you.

You, too, man.

Oh Wow, look at that.

Oh, my God.

Oh, man.

Our, uh cakes merged.

Looks as if they have.

Yeah.

Well - Hey! - Aah! - Ah.

Ah.

Team check-in.

Where we at? Our cake became double cake.

Yeah.

Two cakes.

Yeah.

Two cakes became one? - Two cakes, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Fantastic, I'll go get Jess.

Cool.

Nice.

Hey, Jess.

Hey, guys! What's up, man? She's at the movies.

This might actually work.

At the what? - Come on! More, more.

More.

Uh and, okay.

I think we're good.

Same to the second one.

Hey, Jess, it's, uh, Nick.

You obviously knew that.

Um, I know this is where you always go on your birthday to be by yourself, but I thought this year you might want a little company.

Mind if I sit? Look under the seat.

Now please read the card, I'll wait.

How did you know I was gonna be sitting here? I put one under every seat, - but you got to go fast, 'cause of the timing.

Okay.

"My name is Jess, I like to wear tights.

It's dark in this room, so let's turn on the lights.

" Surprise! Whoo! That's enough.

Timing, guys, timing.

In the beginning, there was nothing, and then there was light and dark and oceans and birds and stuff and then there was Jess! Nick? This was the plan all along? What do I think of when I think of Jess? When I think of Jess.

Okay When I think about Jess I think of how sweet she is and how smart she is.

uh, is glasses and the hair thing.

think of dance parties and sleepovers Jess does not like being tackled.

The eyes, two eyes.

Happy birthday, Ms.

Day.

Your youthful exuberance exhausts me.

May it fade with each passing year.

Well, she made me try papayas.

That was cool.

They're super soft inside.

Jess is the upstairs lady.

There is a there is a ma You make mistakes.

Happy birthday to my best work friend.

Tina, if you see this, I'm sorry.

I just feel like we drifted apart after Jeremy's cocaine thing.

It was awkward.

"When the stirrups of life start to feel like the speculum of old age" Nick, I'm not reading this.

Happy birtay, Jess.

Your boyfriend is sweet and simple and will not get out of my waiting room.

I saw a squirrel once.

It looked like Jess.

Then it att*cked my sister, So I had to b*at it with a stick, and then it didn't look like Jess anymore.

Happy birthday.

It's Bearclaw.

Birthday Winston is about to do some He said a bunch, but it was really weird and r*cist.

Happy birthday, Ms.

Day.

Yay! What I remember most of all is the pain.

Honestly, it was 36 hours-- more than that-- of just searing, ripping, and then Out you came, the most beautiful, beautiful little baby I ever saw in my life.

And I forgot all the pain.

When you were born, I got a deli sandwich at the hospital cafeteria.

And then there was a baby.

Happy birthday to my oldest and my best friend.

And I'm sorry.

Shh, shh.

It's starting.

Happy birthday, Jess.

Oh, snap, snap, - Oh, snap, snap.

Wow - That sounds pretty good.

Thank you.

Hey, listen.

Schmidt, I've been kinda stuck on this whole career search thing.

Oh.

You think I'd be good at advertising? - I mean, that's what you do, right? - Advertising is a dog.

Drinking beer.

A fat moron falling down the stairs.

A snot-nosed brat kicking his rapping grandpa in the testicles.

The rapping grandpa kills me, though.

I am in marketing, Winston.

The backbone of capitalism.

Without it, you'd be d*ad in two days.

I could be good at that.

Probably not, but you can shadow me at work today to find out.

Yeah! Team drug store, back from mission.

Drug store, right, Coach? - Yeah.

Uh, can I have my bag? - Yeah.

Good stuff.

Good stuff.

Thanks.

So, same time next week, right? Team drug store? We'll go again to the drug store? Team drug store? Ugh! God! What a walnut! It's been two months we've been living with him, and I have yet to cr*ck him.

It's like we just spent an hour together.

It was, like, nothing, no connection.

And don't tell me it's in my mind, because it's not.

We ran into one of his friends, and Coach said the meanest thing about me.

Check these out.

Can you believe these are for glaucoma? She's my buddy's girlfriend.

You are my girlfriend.

What's the big deal? I want him to think of me as his friend.

Oh, I hear that.

Well, it'll happen if it's meant to.

I need to find a way in.

I found a way to force myself into all of your lives.

You just didn't know it.

Food, clothes, Onesie pajamas.

I like the butt flap.

You really think mine was food? I can think of five other reasons I wanted to be your friend.

Boob, boob, vag*na, butt cheek, butt cheek.

In that order? Well, I'm not gonna say, "vag*na, butt cheek, boob, butt cheek, boob.

" - Yeah, but that's the correct - That's the order, yeah.

Season 3, Episode 12 "Basketsball"

Look, Nick, I need help.

Like, tell me about Coach.

Like, what's up with him? What does he like? What does he dislike? Well, Coach 101 is, he's watching basketball.

And that's all he's gonna do from October till June.

His team's the Pistons.

I mean, they were great in the '80s, but then we got Jordan.

Then they started getting good.

Then we got Thibodeau.

What you gonna do now? And he knows that.

That's genius.

Basketball.

That's my way in.

Basketball's not your in.

You don't know anything about basketball.

Come on.

You refer to it as "basketsball.

" Well, that's the technically-correct term, Nick.

There are two baskets.

I'm an English teacher.

Basketball's just the first step.

We sit down, we watch a game.

We have a few laughs.

Before you know it, we'll be digging into each other's pasts.

That's not how it works, though.

Childhoods, Nick.

That's the friendship money sh*t.

Men watch sports so we don't have to talk about childhood stuff.

No.

It's a real thing.

And the game doesn't even have deeper meaning.

Come on.

And there's no layers to it.

If I'm talking about a player overcoming the defense to win, - that's not like I'm overcoming it.

No.

Come on.

Not only that.

He's a Pistons fan, and I'm a Bulls fan.

Right.

I don't understand, no.

It's rivalries.

Sharks and cats.

Yankees, Red Sox.

Whales and dolphins.

Pistons fan, Bulls fan.

End of discussion.

I get it.

Jean Valjean and Javert.

Yeah, definitely.

This is like a Jean Vanjer and Vajer situation.

So, where do you do the marketing? - Oh, Winston, so sweet, so naive.

Where do we do the marketing? We do the marketing everywhere.

Now, you're gonna want to take notes on everything I do, 'cause you're about to see life happen at the speed of business.

Schmidt.

I have a task for you.

Hi, Kim.

We got a new guy, and I want you to show him around.

Wait.

Who's this? - Oh, I'm just shadowing Schmidt.

Called my bluff.

Don't care - Ed? Come meet Schmidt.

Okeydokey.

That's the new guy? "New" compared to what, the moon? Here's what happened.

Gwen turned 45, so we had to f*re her.

Obviously.

So, wait.

Gwen's job is available? Yeah, but then grandma turned around and filed an ageism lawsuit, so we hired Bran Flakes here to cover our ass.

Just do it.

All right, I'll do it.

Well, here I am.

Okay.

I'm Schmidt.

I guess they wanted you to learn from the best.

Well, actually, they said your office was closest to the can.

I got a prostate the size of an avacada.

"Closest to the can.

" - Do not write that down, Winston! Is it not closest to the can? Yes! Hey.

Whoa.

I stay sealed off during basketball season.

Plus, I, uh, dropped some olives under the bed, can't reach 'em.

Oh.

I got little pinchers.

Okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yoom.

Hey, so I was gonna watch the, uh, Pistons of Detroit game.

Don't really have the reach for that.

Good thing I got legs.

Wait.

You like the Pistons? - Oh, yeah.

Just like you.

Are you serious?! - Yeah, I'm d*ad serious.

Aw! - So, you in? - Be cool to watch it on a big TV.

I found your olives.

Oh, you did? - Thought they were gonna be in a jar.

No.

This is a big part of the biz, my man.

Networking, face time, making deals.

Normally, this would have a much sexier, businessman's vibe.

But not when I'm dragging around this old drooling potato.

Potata? Yeah, I can split a baked potata.

What a life you must have lead.

Tell us about the street car, will you? Oh, it was a dynamite way to get around.

Mm-hmm.

Pasadena to to the beach - Hey.

I'll take another one of these.

Sure.

You know, Cece, I can't help but think that I am just following another bad lead with this marketing thing.

All I'm doing is taking a bunch of notes for Schmidt.

What's this? "Seems befuddled and totally lucid"? - "Smells too clean"? - Those were just notes about Ed.

I'll tell you what.

That dude is way more interesting than marketing.

If I'm gonna take Gwen's job and become the next CIO of Ass-Strat, I can't just embrace modernization.

I got to make babies with it.

Do you know what I mean? It's time to unveil my baby.

Micro-marketing.

Yeah, we target our messages directly to the individual consumer.

What a good idea.

They're gonna hold a ticker-tape parade for you in the Jewish part of town.

That's right.

In the Jewish part of town.

Mm.

Nothing but net.

Traditionally, "Nothing but net" refers to hitting nothing but inside of the net.

Oh? - Ah, so, yeah, no.

Oh, time-out.

Butt bump.

What? - I'm ready.

What? The butt? Oh.

Come on.

All right.

Hey! Hey! What is that? - It's the Pistons butt bump.

I didn't know your girlfriend was a Pistons fan.

That's got to suck for you, man.

But I guess everything sucks for you when you root for the Bulls.

Butt bump! Ah.

Ah.

Ooh.

Oh, cool, cool, cool.

So you're a Pistons fan now, Jess? - Suck it, Bulls! - Yeah.

Suck it, Bulls! The worst team in the League, the Bulls.

Oh, it's the worst team in the League, all right.

Who is the worst team in the League, Jess? The Bulls.

The Bulls are the worst team in the League.

Hey.

So, went really well today.

I think Coach and I are really connecting.

Come on, what is that? What do you mean? What? Oh, Coach gave this to me.

How cute is this shirt? Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm gonna need you to get out of my bed.

Why? Because of the shirt? - 100% because of the shirt.

Oh, my God, you're serious.

I can't have you in my bed in a Pistons shirt.

Oh, my God! - I need you to get out of the bed.

Jess, I need you to get out of there.

I tried being cool about it, but it's not cool.

Really? - Really.

Nick, it's just basketball.

Why are you taking this personally? Because it's personal, Jess! That's my team.

It's the city that I'm from.

It's most of my relationship with my dad.

R.

I.

P.

, by the way.

Michael Jordan.

The first man that taught me that I could love a man.

And the Pistons are our rivals.

They're like in Hamlet The McCalls and the Sh Hacksperes.

You're my girlfriend now, so You got to be a Bulls fan.

That's the whole point, Nick.

Coach just thinks of me as your girlfriend, and I want him to know me for me.

Do you want me to be friends with Coach? I-I absolutely do.

Yes.

So, then, why can't I be a Pistons fan until we become friends, and then I'll switch to the Bulls? So every year you can just pick a new team? You meet a new friend, you're a fan of that? - I could never trust you.

Can we just have sex now, please? I'm sorry.

You can't be a Pistons fan.

I forbid it.

It has to be this way.

You can't forbid me to do stuff.

That's just not you That's not within your power.

I just did.

The shirt stays! Jessica, you're leaving me no options here.

I'm gonna have to turn off the tap.

What tap? - The sex tap.

But I need my vitamin D.

As long as you're wearing that shirt, the tap is off.

No more hot water.

All right, fine, then.

My shirt and I will go sleep in my bed.

Oh.

What happened to your Pistons jersey? Did you rip it off and rush in here 'cause she got to have it? - Look, is this still a thing? - Oh, it's still a thing.

No sex for you as long as you're a Pistons fan.

You can't use sex to manipulate What are you doing? Just brushing my dirty teeth.

They're filthy.

Nick, do not challenge me to a sex standoff.

I can channel all my sexual energy into knitting.

How do you think I made it through high school? It's good when you go fast and then slow.

Make the teeth wait for it.

You're on.

Oh! Yeah! - Oh! Yeah! Turnover! - Dunk it from the downtown! - Go! Go! Go! - Pass that pumpkin to Josh Smith.

You better listen to my friend.

She knows exactly what she's talking about! Did you just call me your friend? What's up, guys? Ah, two minutes in, and the Pistons are already down by ten.

What a drag.

What the heck are you wearing, dude?

Just my Scottie Pippens.

Yeah.

Oh, hey, I'm just checking up on you.

You frustrated at all?

You need your vitamin D?

No.


Jessica - Three-point play! Yes! - Oh, yeah! - That's what I'm talking about! - We are talking about the same thing My friend and I.

Do my berries make you hungry? Mmm.

Refreshing.

Just drink the water, Nick.

You're turning yourself on now.

I really am, yeah.

Okay, next order of business is Kim, if I may, uh, present an idea very quickly to the group.

While I know - Micro-marketing.

What? Has this company ever considered targeting its message to individual consumers? Big data's knocking.

Let's open the door.

Just a thought.

Yeah, interesting.

Ed, look into that and present it to the board asap.

Great job.

I'd hug you, but you smell like a public library.

What are you doing? - I may be dirty, but I play old.

You said that wrong.

And yet I got my paw wrapped around your avacadas.

What is with you and avacadas? Sorry.

You're never gonna believe what Ed just did.

He s*ab you in the back.

Winston, that's exactly what happened.

How did you do that? I figured him out, Schmidt.

That liver spot out-sharked me.

Can you believe that? I'm-I'm a minnow.

Tomorrow, Ed is gonna present my idea to the board, and then he's gonna get the get the promotion.

My career is toast.

Minnow toast.

Yeah, well, I tip my hat to him.

The minnow tips his tiny hat to the shark, and then lays down on the toast to be eaten.

There is too much going on in whatever metaphor you're trying.

Okay? It's too busy.

Somewhat made se Oh, forget it.

Ed wins.

I'm a mess.

Hell, no, Schmidt.

Justice has to be served, all right? - Mm-hmm.

Right.

Let us stop Ed.

The minnow needs to get up off of No, off of the toast mat and fish-fight his way to the orangutan ball.

I just don't understand why they keep giving these games away! You know what it was? It was that turnover in the third quarter.

Right.

Yeah.

I'll show you.

I can just take your word for it.

Actually, let's do it from the beginning.

You want to watch the game we just watched all over again? - Mm-hmm.

With both overtimes? Great.

Looking for somebody? - Just doing a bed check.

And you are accounted for, so - See you.

So, how's it going? You guys bonding over basketball, Jess? We're actually this close to moving past basketball and into real friendship, so - Great.

I'm feeling pretty good about it.

After the Pistons lost, did he get really sad and talk to you about it? About how he felt and you guys became besties after? Or did that not happen because that's not the way men are? The Pistons lost, so you must be feeling pretty good.

Oh, I'm happy, yeah.

Yeah? - You're feeling excited? - Mm-hmm.

Worked up? - Yeah.

Ready to cave? - Oh, I've never been stronger.

Oh, yeah? So if I just read you a description of Like, what a Piston does, you know, on my phone, it wouldn't affect you at all? Is that what you're saying? It's just a rod that transfers, uh, force from the crank shaft What is this, a seduction class for kindergarteners? Watch the master work.

How about this? A little Paula Abdul stuff.

Yeah.

Are we doing this? - Ha! - What are you doing? Ball's in my court now, pal.

I'm turning off my tap until you become a Pistons fan.

Hey, that wasn't part of the deal.

It is now.

I can't figure out my counterstrike, Winston.

The only thing we know about Ed is that he's old and cranky, and he baffles me because I'm so darn young and pleasant.

We just got to get inside into his old, cranky mind.

We have to find an older, crankier mind.

How are we gonna find an older, crankier mind than Ed? Hey, where are you guys getting your photos developed these days? I got these beefcake selfies that I want to dangle in front of Jess, get her engine revved up.

Your phone has a camera, Nick.

These are sexy, sensual, private pics.

I don't want them beamed right into Snowden's pocket.

I'm not going through Wikileaks, man.

It's not for me.

Analog.

It's the only thing you can trust.

You care to elaborate, you know, on this whole analog thing? No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.

Right.

The hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.

And then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.

Once the screen breaks, your information's in the Twitterverse, man.

And it's all out there for everyone to see, all these little monkey elves, man, all these kids.

That's all they do.

Get your information, man.

Bottom line is you can't control your technology.

That's what's going on in Japan with all those robots.

Not for me, man.

That's why I trust a hard copy.

Plain and simple.

Hard copy, Schmidt.

Nice work.

Thank you.

And, Nick, you know, if you're gonna be taking boudoir sh*ts, please consult me.

I know.

I have a series of poses that many people, including myself, find very sexy.

Okay, here's one that I call the half Nelson.

Yeah, I didn't do that.

This is called a Guy Fieri.

Just taste the sauces.

Yeah.

Black licorice.

Yeah.

You're welcome.

Schmidt's d*ad wrong.

Oh, yeah? - I got some real hot pics in here.

I don't care.

There's one of me as a sexy mayor, looking out the window, deciding the future of my city.

It's got to get her going.

Daddy needs his cookie.

Dude, just wear the damn Pistons jersey.

Oh, my God, I've got to end this.

What time is it?! Game time! - Yeah! - Yeah! It's my favorite time.

Other than medieval time.

All right.

What the? - What the? - Let me see what's - Wait, no, I'll do it.

It's okay.

No! Oh, my God, a mouse Rat or s Uh, some creature.

I got to go watch it in my room.

Wait, no, no, no.

Coach, Coach, Coach.

Look, since we can't watch the game, why don't we just - Have a nice, long chat over coffee? - What? - You know, just talk, hang out.

What? And then coffee turns to dinner, and dinner turns to weekly dinner, and before you know it, I'm best man at your beach wedding.

Do we have to? We don't okay.

You start.

Me? Hey, you want to do this over food? Yes! Yes! No! No, no, no, no! No! Come on! Get your head out of your ass, so you can see where you're going, damn it! Okay.

What? - I have to say it.

Coach, I I don't like basketball.

What? - There's, like, no fun parts.

There's no themes.

Men should not be wearing t*nk tops, ever.

Why were you pretending to like basketball? 'Cause I wanted to be friends with you.

Dude, you're my buddy's girlfriend.

We're watching the game.

What's the problem, dude? What else do you want? No, you're right.

I'm just, um I'm just Nick's girlfriend, so - Enjoy the game.

Okay.

Where are you going? I'm just, um - Jess - Where Jess! Ladies, you all look like a hundred bucks.

I hope someone's taking you out for oysters Rockefeller tonight.

Now, before I begin, my little helper here will distribute some handouts for your reference.

Uh, you know what, Ed? I'm really sorry.

Company printers are on the Fritz, so Little helper that I am, I decided to load everything up onto the laptop.

There you go.

Well, I'm sure there's a printer that works.

I'll just wait for the hard copies.

I broke all the printers.

I'm gonna b*at you with an orange in a sock.

Besides, we're talking about technology, aren't we? Be a little silly to talk about technology without using technology.

Am I right, Kim? - Use the technology, Ed.

Hup-I-dip-I-dip My left arm.

My neck.

You got me this time, Hebrew.

But I'll be back.

This is why the cutoff's at 45, ladies.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Jess! You win! I'm all backed up! I've even been fantasizing about Winston! Where is she, dude? Don't do that laugh.

What are you wearing, dude? - It's for sex.

You like the Pistons.

Why don't you shut up, Coach? - Where's Jess? - What is up with that girl, dude? One minute we're watching the game, the next she's, like, calling me a jerk and storming out of the place.

She just wants to be your friend.

Any idiot can see that.

We were being friends.

We were watching the game together.

It was an awesome game.

Okay, maybe she wants more than that.

Like what? - You want to know a trick? - Absolutely.

This is how you get in with Jess.

You know when you're driving in your car and you have a random thought, like "I wonder if seals are friends.

" Yeah, or like "I really want to text right now, but there's a cop behind me.

" - That's not the one I mean.

"Why do T-Rex have little arms?" Don't finish.

Don't f I know you, don't "If they get an itch in their crotch, how do they scratch it?" I mean more like sweet, kind of emotional stuff.

Like, if you combed, you know, like, a gorilla's hair, would it like it? Like I've never seen a baby pigeon before.

Exactly! Tell that to her and you get a friend for life.

Now, excuse me.

Sex awaits.

Hey, Jess! You win! I want to take you! Respectfully! - Come here.

Take that Jersey off.

Actually, leave it on.

To Winston.

Hear, hear.

As a thank-you, I'd like I'd like to get you a job at Ass-Strat.

I'll make you a real Ass man.

I don't know, man.

I kind of liked the part where we just get to analyze evidence, you know.

Connect the dots a little bit, yeah.

Live inside of someone else's mind.

Spoken like a true marketing analyst.

I don't know.

You know, I kind of want to be free of a desk as well.

Well roam the streets a little bit.

Just sniff out clues.

Let me ask you something.

You guys get donuts in the morning? - You ever thought of being a cop? - Winston, I think you'd be great.

I can see it.

You know, it's funny.

I was thinking the exact same thing.

You've already got high cholesterol and weird people skills.

"Officer Bishop.

" - I like the way that sounds.

It would be nice to retroactively justify that mustache.

It's a hell of a mustache.

What does that mean? That was from a movie.

Training Day's my favorite movie.

I understand that, but you understand that's not what being a cop is.

I want to drop fools! Huh? That's what you're telling me? If you think this means you can start yelling at me You damn right, sucker! That's what that means.

Oh, I apologize about that.

Jess? Jessica Day-hey-ey.

I just want to say that, um, I would love to be your friend.

Look, I know I'm crazy about the Pistons, but it's just because Detroit was the city I lived in the longest as a kid.

Yes.

I lived in, like, six different states by the time I was ten.

At a certain point, I just Stopped trying to make friends.

Got real comfy on that.

Really? Lot easier saying bye to your buddy's girlfriend than it is your friend.

Well, I'm not gonna be saying good-bye to you anytime soon.

Except for right now.

You want to do a butt bump? Butt Ah, you're probably doing your own butt bumps.

Cool.

I know you guys are already done.

Well, nothing brightens up a rainy day like a Scotch tasting, guys.

It's not raining today.

It hasn't rained in months.

Shh, don't ruin the moment.

There's actually a huge forest f*re.

Dude, you should turn on the news.

This is a 15-year-old French oak reserve.

Mm! A note of cedar, vanilla, tobacky.

Boozy.

Hunting, fishing, sh**ting, fatherhood, bonding, sadness.

Please don't leave me.

Cheers, guys.

Put 'er there Schmidty.

Cheers.

Cheers.

To a nice quiet evening.

Tranquil.

This moment is so chill and absent of drama, I want to call it "Tim Duncan.

" I have 21 minutes to make a life-changing decision and you beautiful sons-a-bitches are gonna help me! - Whoa.

Yeah! That is $45 worth of Scotch right there.

It tastes disgusting.

I don't like it.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

So, obviously, Nick has told you about how I've been volunteering at the Children's Museum, and really hitting it off with the head curator, Candace, right? In my way, I have.

I've never heard that.

Hasn't said a word.

Thank God.

Come on.

Guys, give me one second.

I gotta go play a round of "Car Keys Monte" with Kevin-97 or he'll try to drive home.

So, anyway, about a month ago, Candace calls me and tells me there might be a full-time fund-raising position opening up - and I'd be perfect for it.

There we go, look for the keys, look for the keys, look for the keys.

And she keeps pushing me for an answer, and I keep putting her off.

I say, "Thank you very much.

I'm very flattered, but I already have a job.

Me teacher.

" That's a grammar joke.

You get it.

Look at the jukebox for a sec.

When I think of teachers, I think of two things: Jessica Day and p*rn where the characters are teachers.

Well, of course I've always wanted to be a teacher, but my school's a disaster.

Justice Brandeis believed that Ms.

Day? Education's Principal Foster, everybody! Thank you so much.

Ms.

Day, we have h*t a construction hiccup - in our renovation, so - Okay.

everybody's gonna have to be sharing classroom space.

What? - Oh.

Hey, do you have a freezer or should I flush these frogs? My check comes either way.

Oh, come on.

Foster's sticking us with the math kids that use letters instead of numbers? Do you mean algebra? I guess.

Anyway, it's gonna be a couple of crazy months, huh? I'm sorry? Months? Right.

Years if the bond issue fails.

Which it might, since voters are trending anti-future.

Anti-future? Who's anti-future? I don't know.

The Amish? The dying? Television industry, print media, record industry, railroad industry, karaoke machine owners.

You got this? I'm gonna go not smoke pot.

So my phone rings - Oh, we telling phone stories? Nice.

No, I'm talking about work.

So your phone rings.

And it's Candace officially offering me the job! And I told her I'd think about it! Wow, you not being a school teacher? Well, you have found my flabbergast button, and guess what, you've pressed it.

I'm flabbergasted as hell, too.

Look, I've been a teacher my entire life, and I've always wanted to be a teacher, but maybe I should be doing something else.

I don't know.

How do you know when you're on the right path? It's crazy.

That wasn't a rhetorical question.

Oh! - Oh! What I like to do is just take a drive up PCH maybe.

Willy Wonka once said Guys, Candace is calling at 6:00 to find out my final answer! - Whoa! - What? I'm sorry you're in such a pickle.

But I'm not sorry that I get to time something! - All right.

Just to be clear, 19 minutes until 6:00.

I'm not sure this is helping.

This brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation.

Yeah, because you're being timed now.

You time a lot of stuff, Coach.

46 seconds.

This is a life-changing decision, that's it.

Coach, do you always wear a stopwatch? Like always? You familiar with Rollergirl's relationship to her skates in Boogie Nights? - Yes.

Well, I'm not, because I don't watch movies, I time them.

They're p*rn, but they're also a family.

my round ass! Jess, choosing a career path is never easy, but what I found - Oh, my God.

Shut up, dude! She's looking for career advice.

Your job could be done by a vending machine.

Guys, don't be mean.

So Nick doesn't have a traditional career.

I mean Or is it the most traditional? Maybe I'm thinking about prostitution.

Guys, as you all know, I am the expert at changing career paths.

Is this something we're now bragging about? No, Schmidt, I'm referring to my decision to quit playing the game of basketball.

Jess, I will tell you this, it was not easy.

It all began back Come on, Winston move it along.

Okay, Jess, fine, but don't blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies of this crazy English muffin we call Winston's life.

I was the ninth guy off the bench for the eighth-best team in Latvia.

Winnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Ha-ha! Thanks for coming to watch me play, guys.

We didn't watch you play.

We watched you sit.

Which was still fun.

You know, any chance to get to Latvia, right, guys? Yeah, I haven't played all year.

They barely let me practice, but you know, like I always say, How about them Lats? So that's when you decided to change course.

That makes sense.

So my takeaway from that is Still building to the decision.

You are traded to Kraslava City.

The Outdoor League? Man, they play on a hillside! I give you surprise tip: Uphill basket, better.

Aha, and then you decided Ah! I'm going fast! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You never play basketball again.

Don't touch it.

Stop it.

And that's when I decided to stop playing the game of basketball.

Jess, walk away the moment you stop loving it.

I mean, that's what I did.

That's the thing, you didn't walk away.

You decided nothing.

That story contains zero decisions.

Look, I decided to stop playing the game of basketball when my doctor told me I had to stop.

Okay, okay, all right, I it was my decision Mm-hmm.

to start to play the game of basket You were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born.

Damn, do I even like basketball? I mean, goodness, have I ever made any decisions my whole life? Are we all just living inside the mind of a giant? All right, good job, buddy.

Really good.

Thanks.

You know, if I may be so bold Oh, Nick, please.

Winston, have a seat.

I was literally about to give advice.

She already heard one cautionary tale tonight, she does not need to hear another.

What she needs to hear is my story.

All right.

A story of hard choices.

A story of paths taken.

A story that I like to call, "Kablamo McYeah, Bro!" Ah, you stupid bast The title has nothing to do with the story, but you need a hook.

It all began back - Come on, Schmidt! What? Only one story in the whole wide world can begin in a hospital? I volunteered a lot in college.

But I shone brightest as a candy striper.

Sick people wanted me.

Dying people wanted to be me.

I was the total candy-striping package.

And yet I remained invisible to the one whose gaze I desired the most.

Invisible? You were like a 300-pound wall of peppermint bark.

Her badge said "RN" for registered nurse, but as far as I was concerned, it said "NILTH," "Nurse I'd Like To Hug.

" Not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form.

Where's a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that, huh? I don't volunteer.

I'm a man.

I have a job in marketing.

Obviously I was far too fat to work in marketing.

So I got a job any dumb slob could do.

Relax, man, it's your first day.

For a Jewish giant, I had a surprising knack for selling Christmas trees.

Not only did my wide center of gravity make me freakishly strong, but I could also sell like the wind.

Because I understood one fundamental truth.

When you're buying Christmas trees you're really buying sex.

Have you always been short? I've always been fat.

But who cares how God made you? Don't let him put you in a skin box.

At the end of the day, I'm just a fat guy standing here in front of a short guy telling him that I think we found his tree.

It wasn't long before I caught the attention of Old Man McCue, Christmas tree king of Syracuse, inventor of triple netting.

However In the words of the late, great Sir Billy Joel Billy Joel is definitely alive.

And he's definitely not a knight.

"The good, they do die young.

" As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long That even my mama thinks That my mind is gone, but When you're on your deathbed, when your life has been lived, you're never gonna say, "I wish I'd spent more time with my family.

" Because money and everything it buys, you can take it with you Interesting, money.

Actually the museum job pays more than the teaching job.

Wait, the m Then what the hell are we talking about here, you guys? Done deal, case closed.

Follow them ducats.

It's not always about the money, Schmidt.

Guys, look, it's almost 6:00.

And Candace is insanely punctual.

You know, one of the best career choices of the future Driveways.

You're welcome.

Jess, the museum job pays more.

All right - The decision has been made for you.

No, no, no.

You don't know the difference between more and less.

Don't you? - Yes, Schmidt.

All of my decision's have been made for me.

I'm only in sports radio because I played professional basketball.

I played professional basketball because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby.

What if somebody gave Baby Winston a flower? Then what would I be? - Beekeeper! - Hummingbird farmer.

Oh, does water sh**t out of the flower? If so, you'd be a hilarious comedian.

Wait, guys, this is classic after 6:00 topics.

Look, I There has to be more to this than money.

I really want to care about what I do.

Don't you ever miss getting your hands dirty - and selling? - I've moved up in the world.

I'm not freezing and covered in sap.

I'm making spreadsheets.

It's like Old Man McCue used to say.

The reward is in the destination.

It's not in the journey.

Was he wise or was he senile? Because he's mixed up a lot of really well-known sayings.

Jess, you're gonna want to listen to me.

Anyone else here named after their career? People call you Markety? Not yet.

That's too bad 'cause that's awesome.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hands up, Ulvis! Ball screen, Vlad, come on! There we go, yes! Bishop, finger out of your nose, now! Ernie's a really good coach.

Maybe we should call him Coach.

We should probably call him You do it first.

Yeah.


Uh Coach.

That's a great name! High five! Yeah! I think you see what I mean.

No, I do I really don't.

My point is don't overthink it, Jess.

The call's coming from inside the house.

What? Be who you are.

And do what you do.

What if I don't know who I am? And you know, I'm capable of doing a lot of different things.

Then you are on your own.

Good stuff, Coach.

Jess, would it help to think about your first day as a teacher? Like, I think about the first time I ever poured a drink - Boo, get off the stage! - Aw, man.

Nick! - Dude, stop.

No, that's interesting.

The first day I ever taught.

Portland Country Day.

Five-team Pacific Northwest squash champions.

Go, Rhododendrons! Now, if I was chalk, where would I be? If I were chalk, where would I be? Slip up like that in front of the kids, Day, and they'll eat you alive.

Eddie Pascucci kicked my ass because I'm new.

Well, guess what? I'm new, too.

I got lost trying to find the upper dining garden.

Oh, that's over by the hedge maze and the s*ab.

I haven't even met my horse yet.

Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

All of these jackets have cash in the pockets.

It's like a $50,000 lost and found.

Here, try this one.

Yup.

You look great, Clifton.

This doesn't fit! Eddie Pascucci beats up the unstylish! Yeah, that's right.

We had an ethnic, gay bully.

He's gonna have to come through me first.

Clifton Collins really just needed someone to believe in him.

So I started tong him in math, and he became the best math student in school.

So, let's look him up and see how happy and successful and amazing he's doing.

Yeah! - I think that'll really f*re you up.

All right, there's no trace of him.

What? - I'm really, I'm really good at this.

I'm good at it, let me see.

You found him.

He's right here.

No, I didn't.

Here's Clifton, wow.

It's not a - Yeah, he's right there.

That's Clifton.

Oh, yeah.

We're not the only ones looking for him.

So's the FBI.

What? - Yeah, he's a criminal.

No.

Oh, my God.

Clifton "Baby Madoff" Collins? Wanted for 53 counts of embezzlement.

Sounds like the math took.

Screw me.

Like, I Maybe I wasn't even reaching the kids at all.

Okay, you know what? - Miller up.

Excuse me? That's just like "fill 'er up," but with "Miller.

" - Don't.

'Cause I'm about to fill you up.

No, that's gross.

With my stories.

Oh, please don't.

That's disgusting.

What's disgusting about it? My first year of law school, I made an important discovery.

Look left.

Look right.

Next year, one of you will be gone.

What a clichÃÂ©, huh? Oh, you wrote that down.

You'll be gone.

I'm not going anywhere.

I'm gonna be fine.

I'm gonna be right here.

Take it easy, guy to my right.

I discovered that I hated being around these people.

But second year, I made another discovery.

I hated being around myself.

So my third year, I wanted to find a place where I belonged.

Where I could look to my left or look to my right and like what I saw.

Love you in that scarf.

Why don't you wear scarves anymore? That place? Perhaps you guessed it: This very bar.

Get out of town.

What a twist.

How long has that guy been there? Kevin-97? Since 1997, Jess.

Why else do you think we would call him I don't know.

Move it along, Miller.

True, I wasn't loving law school, but my grades were fine and I even signed up for the California State Bar.

And then, one day Red over-served himself and everything changed.

So you went behind the bar, quit law school, you became a bartender - There's more to it than that.

Two minutes! Oh, my God.

I honestly don't know what to do.

I have so little time.

Hey.

Cece! Have you ever questioned your entire career? Duh, I'm a 31 year old model.

My last job was for a phone sex ad, and I was the one calling.

Tell me what to do.

And don't tell me to ask the guys, because I already tried that.

And also, don't tell me to think about my first student, Clifton.

Okay, no, wait.

Your first student was not Clifton.

Lady, she's still got one minute.

That was a butt dial from your mother.

She is up to no good.

Cece, bring it fast, and bring it hard.

You have 53 seconds.

You okay? Yes.

No.

I think I need glasses unless crying makes your eyes not work.

I can't read this, but even when I can, I don't understand it.

Crying makes your eyes work better.

After I finished Sophie's Choice, I could see in the dark for a week.

Here's what I do when I lose mine.

Ooh, this is interesting.

Get in here, we'll learn it together.

But everyone'll laugh at us.

They can drive it or milk it as far as I'm concerned.

I don't know what that means.

I heard my dad say it.

My dad just d*ed.

Well, if you want to come over, and listen to mine say "They can drive it or milk it" you can.

He's also got one about the turds in City Hall.

Thanks.

I'm Cece.

Jess.

I was your first student.

Hey, Candace.

Um Yeah, actually I'm not gonna take the job.

Yeah, I'll see you Sunday.

Okay, bye.

Yeah! - Whoo! - Thanks guys.

Yes! - Thanks guys.

You did it.

Good stuff.

Hey, she did it.

You made the right call, Jess.

What's wrong? I think you're right.

I made the right decision.

Look, I know it's hard, but the hard is what makes it good.

Uhm, A League of Their Own - Is that from A League of Their Own.

Yes, of course.

All of my quotes are from a sports movie.

You guys don't know them, and so they seem original.

A League of Their Own is not a sports movie.

It's a sports movie, first and foremost.

It's about sisterhood and the w*r.

Yeah, absolutely.

It's about a baseball team grinding it up.

This used to be my playground Coming right up.

His sister really worries about his drinking, so what I do is I come in early, and I soak a teabag until the water turns brown and looks like booze.

I call it tea-water.

So tea.

I will take a big old glass of booze-water.

Got an antacid commercial tomorrow - Oof.

and I'm playing day-old curry.

Or you can bartend.

You can bartend till you're 90 years old.

Why don't you f*re this down to Kevin-97? Oh, no.

We're gonna work on that.

Good morning, everybody.

Welcome to Alge-Bio-Civics.

Turn in your equations, and you will get a frog.

Dissect carefully, because inside the frog is the name of the city council member who you will be e-mailing to restart construction.

Ms.

Day? - Yes.

I thought this was gonna be a disaster.

But thanks to you, I can go upstairs to the big boys and tell them they can always depend on Dr.

Alan Foster.

Yeah.

Please take his job, I'm begging you.

I'd do it myself, but I'd never pass the psych test.

So I figure if Foster can be a principal, then why can't I be a principal? - That's great.

I don't see why not.

Thank you.

Then you could take me to the principal's office and punish me - for being tardy, and - You know we're right here, right? Just lift up my britches and - We'll talk about it later.

Okay.

Very nice.

We'll do it in my office.

After I fill up my juice box.

So, guys, just quit my job today.

Whoa, big decision.

Oh, man! - What? I just finally said to myself, "It is time to make your own decisions.

" - Right on.

Yeah.

If it doesn't work out, I'm sure they'd be happy to have you back.

They would they would not like to have me back.

I b*rned a lot of bridges today.

Mmm.

Uh, stuff got weird.

Stuff got racial.

What? - I used a lot of swearwords.

Then I got sexual Well, sounds like you need a drink.

On the house.

What can I get you? - Ooh Let me get a, let me get a We have everything.

What would you like to drink? But you know, I'll make the decision.

Let me get - Double amaretto, extra cherries! - Double amaretto, extra cherries! That's what I was gonna say.

Nice.

Oh, dear.

Oh, my goodness! My first shift, you know? I'm still working on it.

She's getting better.

That was great.

That was awesome.

Yeah.

A natural.

Hey.

Hey.

Sorry I didn't let you finish your story.

What's this? - The end of my story.

No way! You passed the bar exam? I wanted to prove to myself that I dropped out of law school because I wanted to be a bartender, not because I couldn't be a lawyer.

This also says "spaghetti sandwich.

" - That's just 'cause it's a great idea.

When I have a great idea, I write it down.

The point is is I want this.

You know, it makes me happy.

Well, here.

Now, can I get you a drink? - Sure.

Sure.

Cheers.

To unemployment.

Absolutely.

Exactly.

I see you're looking at a Douglas fir.

It's a beautiful tree.

We move a ton of these Dougie firs.

Love them.

But I feel like you're ready for the spruce lifestyle.

Let's spruce this up.

Let me put you in a spruce today.

What kind of ceilings you dealing with at home? Vaulted? Cathedral? By the way, there's no wrong answer.

You look like a confident man, you know that? You deserve a confident tree

Nick! We need to talk.

Winston stays.

End of discussion.

No, dude.

I got your Thanksgiving invitation.

(music playing, turkey gobbling) - Did you make this? - Absolutely not.

He's announcing Thanksgiving! With his little trumpet, he's announcing the feast! It's so funny (laughing) (turkey gobbling) We should name that little guy Roger.

When your testicles fell off, did you form lady parts, or is it kind of like a Gonzo nose down there? It's really interesting.

Yeah.

You see, the thing is, my testicles haven't fallen off Right.

it's just the morning.

And my testicles do this really unique thing of burrowing when it's cold out.

You're burning me.

I gotta be real with you.

Please.

I know how a guy can get, like, lost in a relationship.

I've been there, dude.

You're snuggling, you're snuggling, you're snuggling, and then, bam! Next thing you know, you're wearing a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on, because you guys said you were gonna dress up like each other for Halloween.

But she doesn't dress up like you.

But you still go to the party.

I could not be more sorry for you, but that's not my story.

Stand up.

Stand up? Yeah.

Okay.

Are those Jessica's pajama bottoms? It's, uh football player pants for, uh, br-breast cancer awareness.

I like the way that they hug my gronk.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

JESS: Camping on Thanksgiving? It might be a crazy Nick idea, but I kind of like it.

I thought you hated camping and nature.

You said you were afraid a fly was gonna fly in your head and learn all your thoughts.

I am a man, and men belong in wilderness.

It really means a lot to me.

The only thing I care about is that we're all together.

And that we can all sit down together and have a nice dinner.

I 100% agree.

I think everybody's gonna love this idea.

Me, too.

Camping? - Like we're animals? - What the hell? Come on.

Hear him out.

Let's face it.

Our indoor Thanksgivings haven't been so great.

Turkey! d*ad body! I think I'm into your mother.

So this can't be worse.

Thank you, Jessica, I got it from here.

All right.

This Thanksgiving, I want to honor the traditions of our forefathers.

The mighty Pilgrims and Native Americans who came together in order to survive.

Sure, yeah.

The first chapter in a proud history of cooperation.

It'll be the ultimate test of manhood and our survival skills.

It will? - WINSTON: How's this for a test of our manhood? We stay at home, we drink beer, we watch football.

Manhood.

I like that idea.

Winston, I'm talking about real men.

Me, too.

Men who fend for themselves.

You're the laziest man I know.

Okay, Jess, be honest with me.

Has he ever been on top? Real men are on the bottom.

No, they're not.

(laughing) - You're on the bottom - Guys, guys.

It's Thanksgiving.

We need to be together.

Who's in? Come on, guys! - All right, I'm in.

What? - Yeah, Schmidt! - Yes! Look, my parents were super divorced and they never took me camping, but I always thought that I'd be incredible at it.

Let's get ready.

WINSTON: What the hell is on your head, Schmidt? SCHMIDT: It's an exact replica of the hat.

Viggo Mortensen wore in Hidalgo.

Knew you'd like it.

(Jess chuckles) JESS: Wow! Nice job, Miller! This spot's beautiful.

NICK: I know.

Cece! - Cece's here? I didn't know she was gonna be here.

Yay, I'm so happy you came! (laughs) We're all together! - It makes me so excited.

Of course! I mean, what could be better than camping in the woods with my ex-boyfriend and his friend I just made out with.

With whom you just made out.

Don't.

It's very important.

You know I hate that.

Don't.

Grammar's important.

Seriously, don't.

If it get awkward, I'll come save you.

Happy Thanksgiving! JESS: Yay! (chuckles) Hey, what's up, girl? Hey, Cece.

(clears throat) Hey, I never, uh had a chance to ask you.

How did the, um How'd your guys' date go the other night? - Oh, with Cece? - Yeah.

Uh it was I loved it.

I mean, it was good.

It was cool.

That's great.

Super.

Super-duper.

So where you thinking - about pitching, uh, pitching a tent? - Thinking over there.

Oh, yonder? - Yeah, sure.

Yeah.

Yonder.

Listen, I've been researching on the Internet for the past 12 hours everything there is to know about the wood.

Now I'm a I'm a master camper.

So if you need any help with anything, just come to me and ask, okay? (chuckling): Thanks, man.

I don't know anything about the wood.

I know everything.

I'm lost.

What is that, a tree? If these trees were skyscrapers, - you'd feel very comfortable.

Yeah.

I'd be right at home.

Unfortunately, - they're actual trees.

(chuckling): Yeah.

You're the best.

I love the hat! I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger? Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.

(quietly): Okay, hold on.

Do you do you hate camping, too? Are you kidding me? I absolutely hate camping.

Then why are we here? Because I didn't get a say.

I never get a say.

Whenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.

Guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.

Get out of here.

Winston! We could've made the craziest mugs, man.

(grunts) - Hey, Nick? - Yeah.

There's just beer in here.

That should last us for the first few hours, - actually.

Where's the food? Where-where are all the pies I made? Look, don't worry, Jess.

'Cause the food is right here.

I'm sorry.

I don't understand that gesture.

We're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner, just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.

But you brought beer.

You can't forage for beer.

And that's a necessity.

So this is Thanksgiving meal? We can do this.

Guys, we've gotten soft! With our antibiotics and our sports creams.

Do you think George Washington had a pet cat? Yeah.

No.

He didn't.

He hunted them.

What? And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.

That's terrible.

So you're saying George Washington milked his cat? Nothing is sounding accurate right now.

Not at all.

Where'd you read this? I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

It's gonna be hard.

But we will emerge out of this better friends and a tribe.

I'm on board.

(chuckles) Going old-school.

Men! k*lling! Hunting! Men! SCHMIDT, COACH and NICK: Men! Men! Men! Men! Oh, my cowman's my cowman my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.

WINSTON: Guys, look, I'm as much a man as anybody here, but this plan is straight-up dookie.

I need my sweets and I need my parade.

Yeah, you know what? I'm out, too.

Guys, guys, guys.

Look.

We're together.

We're a family.

It's Thanksgiving.

And I'm sure Nick has a plan.

Right? - Oh, yeah.

I've got a plan.

Great.

You got a plan? - The man's got a plan.

These wilderness guides right here detail what plants are safe for eating and what traps we can build.

Unfortunately, I ran out of money, so I couldn't print out the chapters on gutting and skinning, but we'll worry about that when we get there.

Pilgrim rules.

Men, hunters! Women, foragers.

I'm not hunting.

The only Hunt I want is Bonnie or Helen.

You know what I'm talking about, Coach.

What? Nick.

This is perfect.

Primal man in nature.

Stalking prey.

Who's basically the lady now, Coach? I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.

We're definitely moving in a small circle.

NICK: Here's what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna clear a path this way.

We will travel northbound, I believe.

That's not north; that's south.

That is south? Then let's travel southbound.

I'm gonna clear a path.

If something's in there and you get injured, I promise you I will k*ll you fast.

(groans) Scat! Scat.

There's an animal nearby.

Hey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.

That's not a raisin.

This is scat.

Okay.

(coughs) (clears throat) That's poop for sure.

I was right.

In your face, Nick.

In your face, Nick.

How so? I don't know, he put a put a turd in his mouth.

And that's in my face? - Yeah.

I don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.

Let's wait on that.

You want to chase that with some dirt? Does anyone have any gum? No.

Not that I wanted any in the first place.

That's a mighty big hole there, Nick.

You trying to catch a refrigerator? It's a bear hole.

Bear falls in, other stuff falls in.

We take what the bear doesn't want.

Makes sense.

Classic human/bear team-up.

I'm from Chicago.

It's the best I can do.

Yeah, bears love to share.

What are you planning on doing with that bear when he falls into the hole? Dude, I'm trying the best that I can! We have no food.

Let me explain something to you, Nick.

When you're building a trap, you want to customize it to your prey.

So, I don't know, if was trying to catch, say a squirrel, I'd want think like a squirrel.

Allow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.

How do you get into the mindset of a squirrel? (clicking tongue) I'm a squirrel right? You do that really well.

Look at this! Oh, there's some nuts here.

Look at all these little nuts.

You might not want to do that.

If I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class, I'd ask you, but this is my territory.

(Schmidt yells) - My scapula! - Dude, are you all right? Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah! (Schmidt groaning) Get it! Get up.

Keep breathing, man.

I don't mean to be laughing, but are you okay? I'm gonna make you a sling.

You're gonna make me a what? You don't know how to do that.

A sling.

Of course I do.

What? - What are you doing? - I was an Eagle Scout.

What are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout? - Look.

That's actually really good.

I'm sorry, dude.

You wanted to be the best at camping.

You were so excited about your hat.

I didn't want to get in the way of that.

Plus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.

What are talking about? You're gonna let me be the best camper.

I am the best camper! Yeah.

I think this is chicory.

It says you can eat the root.

Or it's jasmine.

Which will k*ll you.

Hmm.

What do you guys think?

I'm sure it's fine.

Yeah, just eat it.


Hey, raspberries! There Ow! (laughs): Ow.

There are a lot of brambles in here.

There's a country store not far from here.

Ow! Three and a half stars.

The reviews say, "It's functional and dusty.

" - Ow! - Sounds good to me.

This is so fun.

Who wants to help? This plan is officially the worst.

We are starving.

Just admit, you don't want to do this, either.

Okay, listen up.

Only stuff we can find in the forest, right? Look at that fish.

It's perfect.

What? Oh, I'm gonna grab it.

I'm so hungry.

Now we get to eat, boys.

Dude, that looks d*ad.

Guys, stop being negative right now.

Laying on its side means it's d*ad.

I wouldn't get in that water, man.

You're gonna get beaver fever.

Where are my testicles now, Coach? When he catches that little critter, I'm gonna show you how to scale it.

Ow.

That hurts? Yeah, it hurts! A boulder fell on my Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite? Yes, it is! No regrets! (grunts) Aw! Aw, come on, Nick.

(yells) NICK: Yes! Quit it.

You guys might be right! It might be d*ad! In fact, it was d*ad! Smells fresh enough! Oh, come on, Winston, what? You just get your nails done? Get the apple dirty! Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.

God, I'm so hungry! Hey, hey! Hey.

Look what the men brought.

Oh, hey! Hey, hey! The plan worked.

Hey, he looks like a fighter.

He really was, kind of.

Oh, my God! - Wow.

I mean, well Whoa.

Like a smorgasbord.

You guys did great.

Yeah, we did.

Yep.

Where'd you get the cashews? - Um, on a bush.

Yeah.

How about the beets? - Also a bush.

That's right.

Yeah.

The avocado? - Also on a bush.

That's right.

Well, look at us.

Living off the land, fending for ourselves.

We got fish and fruits, and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple I've ever eaten in my life.

"Product of Oregon"? We walked to Oregon? - What? - What? That's why this cramp Yeah This place Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses? We're not.

I kind of knew from the beginning.

I mean, there's no way.

You just went to a store and got all this? I think so.

I think they definitely bought everything from the store.

The one thing I wanted was for us all to sit down together and have dinner, and you can't do that without dinner.

We have dinner.

That fish kind of looks like hippo meat.

Come on, man.

Let's just sit down and eat some delicious almonds.

And enjoy ourselves.

Yes.

And have a really nice Thanksgiving together.

Come on, Nick, let's eat.

Come on, man, let's eat.

I feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.

Betrayed.

What? Happy Thanksgiving.

Oh, come on.

Nick, come on! - Don't do this.

FYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.

WINSTON: Come on, Nick! These avocados were expensive! Here we go.

It smells so good.

I can't wait till it's ready.

I'm gonna be so stuffed.

Ooh! The eyeball fell off.

That's how you know it's good.

They got to pop out when it's ready, I think.

Now that the cards are finally on the table, I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.

The answer's me.

First one to make a flame wins.

Let's do this.

Now, check this out.

This is how you make a flame.

You go with two rocks.

One against the other.

You create friction.

I'm done.

What? I'm done.

Well, that's barely a flame, it's going out.

Whoa! Well, goodness gracious! What are you? A sorcerer? Damn it! Hey, mountain man.

You want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us? I should've known those beets weren't from nature.

Nothing purple grows in nature.

Look, we didn't come through, okay? You came through! Look, you caught a fish! That's really, really impressive.

How'd you do it? With my bare hands.

No way! You're so strong.

Yeah.

Yeah, it was It fought What are you doing? I'm not doing anything.

I think that's amazing.

You provided for us.

You're a man.

Don't patronize me, Jess.

I'm not.

Ever since we started dating, Jess, we've been doing a bunch of girly stuff, and I like some of it and you, but my tolerance to alcohol has, like, gotten really, scary low.

I drank three beers, and I got, like, all giggly and tired.

And I didn't want a fourth.

Last night, I had a dream that I was brushing a horse.

I just feel like I'm losing myself a little.

Just let me eat this disgusting fish and - No, Nick, Nick.

Yeah, just let me be over here.

This is the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.

Don't touch I wouldn't touch it.

It is! It is.

Jess, don't Don't put your hands in Oh, my Lo Spit it out.

Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Fragrant.

Mmm, I can really I can really taste the lake.

Spit it out.

I feel like I'm there in the lake with the fish.

Mmm! Bony.

That's gonna hurt going down.

But I like it.

Hurts so good! Hurts so good! Jess, that fish was d*ad when I caught it.

There was a sock near it.

(suppressed gagging) I'm gonna come with you.

No.

Jess, let me come with you.

Where are you going? There's something over here.

I'm gonna look at it.

Jess I'm seeing some interesting things.

I'm out of the office till Friday.

For immediate assistance, please call Deb at extension A.

C.

Slater.

(grunts) You guys see where she went? - No.

No.

Jess? - Jess? - Jess? Jess! - Jess? - Jess? NICK: Jess? Jess! I just want to see more carpet samples before I make a final decision.

(gags) Jess! CECE: Jess? NICK: Jess! Jess, where are you? Jess! Jessica! NICK: Oh, God, this is all my fault.

And you know what, Coach? I did like the invitation.

I made it.

And I liked the little trumpet guy.

I thought he was cute.

He was cute as a damn button! - What? So many st Hey, guys, look.

There she is! There are dogs that have dollar signs but don't even own banks.

Jess, we're over here! - Jess! Wait, wait, wait.

I've seen that tree before.

Jess, stop! The bear trap! (gasps) - No! - I'm coming! Jess! Headfirst? Why? (Nick groans) (groans) Son of a (gasps) Oh, my God, Jess, I am so sorry.

I was an idiot.

This Thanksgiving plan was so stupid.

You shouldn't have eaten that fish.

I'm sorry.

Don't let them pay the bill, okay? You bring the check to me.

No arguments, moon man.

CECE: Oh, my God! Is anyone hurt? We're fine.

I may have cracked a few ribs, and, uh, Jess is delirious.

I think she thinks she's a rabbit.

Guys, we're gonna figure something out, all right? NICK: Just get us a rope or a stick or something.

All right, man, so, any ideas? What are you talk? You know what, Coach? Don't humor me.

What? - You know what to do.

Look, I admit it.

You're a better camper than I am.

You're better at life than I am.

You're probably better at dating Cece than I am.

I saw you guys the other night inhaling each other in front of the loft.

Schmidt, that's all we did.

That was it.

I asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay? And now she won't return any of my text messages.

She's been ignoring me this whole trip.

I'm all, like, "Hey.

" She's like, "Mm-hmm.

" I'm like, "What?" Why are you smiling, dude? I'm not smiling.

I'm over here baring my soul to you, dude, and you're freaking smiling in my face.

Yeah.

This is the face I make when I listen.

All your teeth show when you listen? I'm not.

You're smiling right now.

I opened up to you.

You're pissing me off.

Stop smiling.

I'm not.

I will wreck you.

You're crazy, man.

You're nuts.

Stop it, listen to me.

We are going to solve this right now.

All right, take your pants off.

Okay, I am no Eagle Scout, but I know how to make a pants rope.

Pants rope.

You're a genius.

I know.

Okay.

Are you gonna take off your pants? Yeah, right after I take off my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.

That's gonna happen for real? - Just take them off now.

(laughing): Whoa, look at Winston's pants.

It's got kittens on it.

These aren't kittens.

I cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.

So stupid.

Take them off.

They're coming off.

CECE: Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.

Okay, you go first, Jess.

I'll be right behind you to support you.

Ding, dong, ding, dong! - What are you doing? Okay, how about this? Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.

Back at you.

Whoa.

(coughs) You can do it! There, hold this flashlight, buddy.

Grab hold.

(bl*ws raspberry) - Come on, Nick! Come on.

Here we go! Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.

(straining) Use your legs, Nick.

(grunting) Come on, Nick! Come on.

Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings.

Come on.

Almost there.

Let's go.

You got it, you got it.

You got it, you (straining) (all exclaim) (sighs) You chubby son of a bitch.

Yeah.

(groans) You okay, Jess, you all right? Yeah! - Yeah.

Yeah.

ALL: Oh! Hey.

Thanks for saving me, mountain man.

So I've got good news from the doctor: you don't have rabies.

Oh.

You have, uh, giardia and something called Legionnaires' disease.

I'm just glad they were able to save your foot.

What? No, nothing.

Never mind.

(chuckles) Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.

Oh, no, it's okay.

Ah, I was really stupid.

I haven't been myself.

You're the man I want.

All you wanted was for everyone to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.

Next year.

Potato chips.

Chips? Maybe a treat.

Listen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought maybe that I could give you some advice about about Cece.

How desperate do you think I am? I think you're probably very desperate.

I'm very desperate, I mean, she's giving me nothing.

Told her she looked pretty, she said thanks.

Mm-hmm.

What kind of mind game is that? Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.

Cece is not going to be one of those things.

I once spent hours in a car with just a cracked window for air.

She was going into a club and she just kind of left me there.

Why are you smiling about that? Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.

I got a plan.

SCHMIDT: Enough with the plans.

You suck at plans! Not another Nick Miller plan.

I love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.

Hey.

It's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.

What? Got us some Brazilian nuts, a couple of string cheeses, and.

Snack.

Thank you.

WINSTON: I got the parade on my phone.

Yes.

Made some decorations.

I think this may be a turkey sandwich, but I'm not sure, and I know this whole thing isn't It's perfect.

Look, guys, start without me because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.

(all laughing) You were throwing up a lot.

(laughs) That was scary seriously.

Okay, I'm starving actually.

Let's eat.

Yeah, let's eat.

Nick found all this food in the woods.

(all laughing) Can I have the ginger ale? Yeah, Nick found that.

It's already open.

Oh, hey.

I was wondering about date night tonight.

Do you wanna just stay in? 'Cause you know what that means.

Romantic dinner and "Homeland"? - Sex on the couch.

Or your thing.

Actually, "Homeland" sounds great.

Or your thing.

Hey, Nick, um Last night when Ferguson and I were in the shower, I had an epiphany.

It's time to get back in the game.

You know, meet some women.

Human women.

Human? Is there any other kind? Anyway, I was wondering if you'd watch Ferguson tonight while I go out for some drinks with some work buddies.

Just for a little while.

You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.

We're having date night tonight.

Jess Winston wants to go out to meet human women.

Without the cat.

Oh, yep, yep.

Yep, yep.

Nick will watch the cat.

Question Are those mouth pills or butt pills? Just one pill.

Just one butt pill.

Here you are.

I'm not touching that thing.

No? Okay.

Thanks, man.

Yeah.

You got it.

Hey, guys.

Just hanging at home tonight? No, actually, we have a date tonight.

'Cause I just made some cobbler.

Some peach cobbler and slow-churned vanilla bean ice cream, and Coach is asking Cece out on a date tonight, and Does anybody want a bite of this, 'cause it's? Ho! Ho! It's fresh out of the oven.

It's piping hot! Ha! Ha! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Well, I hope Coach at least ran this by you first.

Coach came over, he followed the bro code.

Actually went really well.

Yeah.

Just the man I wanted to see.

You found me.

Yeah, I did.

I got a question for you, playa.

Drop the b*mb, man! Can I ask Cece out on a date? Yeah! Wait, what? Wait, that's so great for Cece.

Coach is super hot.

Wrong crowd.

I see that now.

Be that as it may, you blew it with Cece, so you have to be fine with this.

I am.

You are? - I promise I am.

You are? - 100% fine.

You're fine? - Yeah, I'm absolutely fine.

Really? It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach, it's good for America.

Who knows? We might even get another Tiger Woods out of this situation.

Wouldn't that be nice? I'm probably getting ahead of myself.

Who knows if Cece will even say yes? She said yes! We're going to the Staples Center to watch a game tonight.

Are you still Are you cool with this? Hmm? I mean, 'cause all you have to do is say the word, man, and I'll back off, for real.

N No, man.

Come on.

Date that thing.

Yeah! And then date it again.

All right.

It's not gonna date itself.

Yeah, date it all night long.

I'm kind of nervous! Yeah, I'm nervous.

Yeah, I'm really nervous.

Um I mean, she's beautiful and she's super cool.

And it's just, like Like, you don't even know.

I 100% know.

Yes, you kno You know.

She stopped the wedding because of me, so I'm just saying.

And then I ruined it 'cause I had my own thing.

Malia broke up with me and that kind of, like, threw my head for a loop, so I'm super vulnerable right now.

It's like I don't know.

Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.

Come on.

You're Coach.

You're the Coach.

Yeah.

You're the prize.

Remember, you're the prize.

You're the prize.

I'm Coach! Yeah, you're Coach.

She doesn't stand a chance! - Oh, yeah, well She's gonna get it good! Yeah! Or you could take it slow! - Nah, I'm g*n it! - Oh, oh! Y-you're gonna g*n it.

I am g*n it.

Yes.

You're gonna g*n it for real? That first-class ass is sitting in coach tonight.

And best believe, my seat will be in an upright and locked position.

Thanks, Schmidt.

Oh boy.

He's gonna g*n it.

I don't know if you heard that, but he said he's going to g*n it.

He's really not fine.

When he says, "I'm fine," he's about to get un-fine.

Aw, Schmidters.

There's gonna be other open mics.

With sturdier stools.

I'm fine.

I know you're fine.

Then they'll see your rap skills.

Then Hey.

Stop! You just said you were fine! You just said you were fine! Let me die! I know Schmidt.

He's gonna try and stop that date from happening.

Okay.

So the strategy is containment.

Okay.

We got to lock him up.

Distract him like a baby.

If he gets out of line, we got to get physical.

We're gonna get physical with a baby? Please don't question me.

I'm a pro.

Or we could help him move on.

Take him out, get him drunk, maybe meet someone new? No.

We just got to keep him in a safe place.

I wish I had that dog cage.

What? When you see a dog cage for sale, you buy it.

Hey, Jess, about tonight, I'm so sorry.

We'll have date night when we're marrie - Da, burp a durp a durp.

What did you just Merry.

When we're very Merry Christmas.

All right, moving on.

Hey, uh I'm having second thoughts about Coach and Cece.

Maybe I should stop their date.

Smarten up! Thank you.

Um Did you get a chance to get that, uh the dog cage? - No.

I feel bad.

You didn't? - That was the solution.

I know it was.

Yeah, Jess, so I j I just I just buzzed him up.

I He asked me out on a date, and I said yes.

We're both going through a breakup right now, - which is good, right? - Totally.

g*n it.

g*n it! - He's here.

Don't go past second base.

Okay.

Bye.

Hey.

Hey.

Wow.

Uh, y-you look amazing.

Aw.

You look this.

I give you this 'cause you look this, this and this.

I'll give you all these.

No.

Thank I'm really excited about the game.

Yeah! Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm gonna go get my purse.

Okay, cool.

What is wrong with you? You're the prize! You're the prize! Get it together.

Hey.

What's up, man? - Hey.

That's what's up, that's what's up, that's what's up.

Really appreciate this, guys.

Are you guys hungry? - Always.

Yeah.

Great.

I'm gonna go get some food from the Staples Center.

Hey, easy.

Chill out.

Okay.

All right.

You're right, you're right.

Great call.

Hey, Winston.

Hey.

What happened to you? I thought you were supposed to go to a party.

Yeah, it's been so long that I think I forgot how to talk to women.

You ever wonder if someone in here has k*lled someone? Ferguson is his name.

Yeah, he's my cat.

Here's him in a cowboy hat.

Good lord, darling, how big are your feet? You know what? It's fine.

I'll be alone my whole life.

You know, Hank Aaron was alone for every home run he h*t.

As long as I got Ferguson.

Speaking of which, where is that cat? Ferguson! That's strange.

He usually comes when I call him.

Nick, you left the window open? Oh, my God, no.

Nick! - What? You know he always trying to kick it with those pigeons.

Nick, you let him out.

I did I didn't mean to.

I just opened the window.

Man, I asked you to do one thing! - Winston, I'm really sorry.

This is your fault, man! - I feel terrible, Winston.

You're gonna help me find him! Winston, don't leave Winston Okay, I'm coming, buddy.

Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to stay here and keep an eye on Schmidt.

No! No, no, no.

You can't leave me here with him.

No, she's right.

You can't do that.

What if it gets rough? Nick, he is in pain.

I can feel it.

Don't you go! - Stay! I am so scared, man! What do you want me to do, Jess? - Stay.

Everybody settle! Look, this is my fault.

Winston, I'm coming with you.

Schmidt, just get it together.

Jess, I'm sorry.

Just keep him here and keep his mind off the date.

I have to go.

I'm sorry.

We got to go.

Let's find that damn cat! What do you think Coach and Cece are doing right now? - I don't know.

They probably just sat down.

Touching thighs for the first time.

I'm gonna go stop that date! - No! Is that literally all you have? Oh, my God, we're screwed.

Nick! - Nick! Uh, think.

Coach gave me an out.

He said, "Just say the word and it's off.

" And you know what? I'm just gonna say the word.

No! No! You call, you say the word.

No, Schmidt! God, you can't do that to Cece.

Damn it! I should've never gone to that party.

Nah, the party was a good thing.

You should go to more parties.

Really? I got sh*t down by, I don't know, And then I come home to find out that you have misplaced my best friend.

Ferguson's your best friend now? - Yes! Would you listen to yourself? This is pathetic.

Whoa.

"Pathetic" is harsh.

I didn't mean - Friends don't call friends pathetic.

Well, what do friends do when their other friend is taking a shower with a cat? Wait, wait, wait! I just got a text.

Somebody found him.

No way! Ferguson? - Yes.

Yes! Don't do that at all.

If that cat's alive, we're made up.

Uh-oh! Ha-ha! Look at that.

Coach is bl*wing up.

I'll just Thanks.

Damn it.

I can't mingle with this trash.

I've been to the mountaintop.

Okay, look.

Look at me.

You are moving on.

Now, where's the old Schmidt? When I moved into the loft, you used to pull so many ladies.

You were legendary.

That year, uh, Hurricane Schmidt did-did demolish - a number of beach communities.

Right.

All right, we're gonna go talk to this girl over here.

She's on a flip phone, Jess.

I mean, she's either poor or a time traveler.

Hi! This is my friend Schmidt.

And he's sweet and he's smart.

And he has a job that I don't really understand, but seems to pay him well.

Schmidt, sit down.

Okay.

I'm gonna give you two a moment.

Look, you're a beautiful woman.

In another life, we certainly would've been lovers, but my soul mate is at a Sparks game right now with another man.

I need to go get her.

Oh, you poor thing - Please don't interrupt me.

Now, do you see that bug-eyed woman over there? I need to ditch her so that I can go fulfill my destiny.

Now, tell me when she looks away.

Not now.

Not now.

Wait.

Now.

What might've been.

Hey, Schmidt! No! What do you think he's gonna look like when we get him back? Found him under the steps eating a d*ad raccoon's eyeball.

Your cat's a psycho.

Oh, did my baby have a tasty treat? Ferguson, I missed you so much, little buddy.

They're very connected, those two.

I can relate.

Got a beast of my own.

Hodgkiss, wake up.

We got company.

Aw.

Is that a squirrel? - Squirrel? It's a hamster.

Nick, you know what a squirrel looks like.

Okay, you've been outside, man.

Trying to just figure out the smell, I guess.

This guy's the best.

I'd rather stay home and watch Grey's with him than go out to some bar, try to impress some douche bag dressed like a lumberjack.

I am done chasing men.

I hear that.

I am so done chasing women.

That's too bad.

Yeah, it's too bad.

You guys hungry? - Oh, no, but thank you very much - I could eat.

Winston, do you like bologna? It's the kind you have to peel the wrapper off just to get to the meat.

And do you have pudding in a cup? I never have pudding in a cup.

No.

Is that a good thing or a bad thing that she doesn't? That's a good thing.

You know, I don't know what's going on here.

Find Staples Center! Finding Starples Medical Supply.

No, you dumb pocket robot! Dan plummer rubber stumpers.

Aah! Now you're just making up words! That's not even a place! Damn you! Maiden worcestershire sauce.

Huh.

Chocolate.

I know.

Okay, good.

Come on, get back in the car.

I also know that in about 30 seconds, I'm gonna run away from you again, and this time, I will lose you.

I know you're not.

I'm not fine.

But I will be.

Uh Let's just wait it out.

Okay.

God, it's been a half an hour.

Come up for air, you weirdoes.

Mm, mm, mm.

I'm getting kind of revved up.

Ah, Hop Foo's, my favorite.

Don't mind if I brunch.

Are you eating takeout for breakfast? - Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

You're not supposed to judge anything I do.

Say that again.

You're my girlfriend now.

(both laugh) I like it.

Even when you have dumpling in your mouth.

Sounds good.

I have to go.

I have a big meeting with Principal Foster today.

I hate that guy.

He always says no to your ideas.

No, no, no.

Not this one.

This one is, uh, Ocean Conservation Day.

Why do you do this to yourself, Jess? So you're telling me to not even try? I just don't want you to be disappointed when he says no.

Look, maybe you should try to try a little less.

How am I supposed to try to not try? - That's a catch-22.

Oh, hey, Coach.

Oh, I dropped a dumpling! - That his breakfast? - Yeah.

Isn't it cute? - He's not even ashamed of it.

Oh I got it! It almost got away from me Aah! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

Look, Principal Foster, we have the chance to do something really great.

Everything's been donated.

All we need are transportation costs.

(stammers) Come on! That's only the most expensive part of doing anything! You I'm sorry.

That was rude.

I slept very badly last night.

Had a chai tea very late.

Had friends in from Montreal.

Some of these kids have lived in L.

A.

their entire lives and they've never even seen the ocean.

Last week I asked them to draw what they thought the ocean looked like.

I got a lot of stuff like this.

Is that a bagel with wings? - Yes, sir, it is.

Extraordinary.

I'm afraid I'm not taking no for an answer.

You're gonna have to take no for an answer because that's just the way it is.

Hmm, a shark with legs.

That's not even anatomically close to correct.

That's just a square, though.

Have them start over.

That's just terrible.

Nick? I want to talk to you about your fitness level.

Of what? My body? - When's the last time you worked out? You know what? I'll tell you when the last time he worked out was.

It was the time that he battled his daddy's other dumb sperm in order to make his way to his mama's dumb-ass egg.

Your burns are getting better, man.

Just really long.

Okay.

Look, I don't need to work out.

I'm old-fashioned, Coney Island fat-strong.

Ah, Nicholas.

Chinese food for breakfast.

See you're still a health nut.

Aren't you supposed to be at work? - I'm rocking a PD personal day.

Yeah, last day of the move.

Coach, I see you've wasted no time moving into my old room.

Anyway, I just came over to, uh, drop off my old key.

Wow, so this is like a moment.

Looking to get some much-needed space from this place.

You're right across the hall.

That's true.

Everywhere you go There you are.

What? - COACH: What? - His jeans are so small.

NICK: He looks like a little puppet.

Like something some Italian whittled.

Come on, man, just let me train you.

You know what, Nick? You should do it.

I would love for Coach to train me, but I kind of pushed it too hard at the court yesterday.

Went in for a dunk.

Landed sort of funny.

(yells) Typical Winston.

(laughing) - That's true.

What is that supposed to mean? Because you're always too injured to play.

Remember when you sat out of the game because you were sad? I was also cold.

Nick.

Let's do this.

Look at me.

Now, you're in a new relationship, which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15.

That's not a thing.

It is a thing.

Jess is into this.

I've seen this happen a million times.

The boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20.

Next thing you know, you're a fat dude on a little bike with a cowboy hat on talking about, "My ass hurts.

" - I don't want to be that.

I don't want you to be that.

I would just be riding around in circles or would I be going places? Circles, dude.

Fat-guy rash on your arm.

Okay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me to work out for years.

It didn't take.

Also, and it's not an excuse, I have a very bad back.

Your bad back? - Yeah.

You gave me a piggyback ride two days ago and you giggled the whole time.

It was awesome.

It was also really funny.

That was pretty funny.

We took the stairs, dude.

Yeah.

It's 'cause I was excited.

Nick.

Either take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy, or you train with me, and be a do-ing guy.

It's hard because I've been a dumpling guy my whole life I know.

One day, that's all I need.

And I will change your life.

You'll be able to see your abs.

I thought God just didn't give me those.

Come on.

Let's do it.

My man! - I'm in! I'm gonna warn you.

Working out is not my thing.

Not worried, man.

I do not fail.

You know what? I'm in, too.

You're injured, you shouldn't, you shouldn't do it.

What? Come on, Winnie the Bish play through the pain, baby.

You know what? Let's warm up with some jumping jacks.

(yells) (smacks lips) (groans) I was going Oh! Miss Day! Check out my cool beach hat.

Unfortunately, um, I have some bad news.

Uh, we're not gonna get to go on that field trip.

But you said anything is possible, Miss Day.

You just keep wearing that hat, Crystal.

Because as long as hot dogs are hats Anything is possible.

You could be the first little girl in space.

You just ride that hot dog hat all the way to the moon, girl.

Oh, Crystal, you're not legally allowed to touch me.

But thank you.

(groans) Hey, guess who got a trainer.

So many menus.

I'm gonna look like Barry Bonds.

Seriously, what the hell? - Hey.

(groans) I take it, it didn't go well with Foster.

It did not go well.

Aw, Jess.

I hate seeing you hurt like this.

Are you serious? More menus? This is like Why do we need more menus? - Don't we have enough menus? - Feels like you're saying menus a lot.

This is an eco-disaster.

Conservation deserves a win today.

Hop Foo's has k*lled its last tree.

Jess, this feels like a something-else-is-going-on type of thing.

Are you okay to drive? You got crazy eye! Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's.

Can I help you? This morning, there were nine menus just in my apartment.

I also hate those menus, they're so bad for the environment.

It's wasteful.

It's an eco-disaster.

I'll talk to my boss, see if we can change that.

Yeah, great, you do that.

I'm gonna follow up with you on that.

I compost, recycle, but it's I don't feel like it's enough.

Thank you.

Geez, thank you so much for stepping up and saying something.

That's who I am, that's just, you know, I'm - My name's Brian.

Jess.

Jessica.

Jess.

It's really refreshing to meet someone who actually cares.

Well, it helps that you're gorgeous.

Ha! Blah! (laughs) Burr! No, that's crazy.

That ain't real.

That's dumb.

That's straight dumb.

You're dumb.

You're nice.

You excited for the holidays? I am.

Hmm.

Anyway - My system is built to be easy.

Okay.

It's easy as peanuts.

Easy as peanuts? - Yeah.

That's not an expression; no one says that.

PEANUTS is an acronym.

PEANUTS stands for: Physical Education Activity Nuts! Like, like go nuts, have fun! Yeah, but you got to use every letter.

I'm aware of that, but it still works.

Yo.

Yo.

Hey.

What's going on, guys? (chuckles) Let's do this.

I tell you, ain't no injury gonna hold Old Winnie the Bish down, 'cause I'm a warrior.

Nick knows.

Burpies? All right, cool.

(groans) - Injury is gonna get worse.

I'm not a quitter! (phone rings) Hey, Schmidt, what's going on, man? Everything okay? Did I leave my Oakland Raiders yarmulke over there? Don't know.

Coach and I are working out.

I've been trying to get you to work out for years.

Well, just come over, man.

I'm enjoying my space.

But maybe you should just put me on speaker.

Okay, you're on.

Okay, cool, set the scene.

What's the vibe over there? - Nick's in jeans.

Nixon jeans? What the hell are Nixon jeans? They sound really cool.

(sighs) Hey, I solved the menu thing.

I just went down there, I took action.

Boom-yah.

I made a change.

Now that I can do that, I really feel like I can figure out this field trip thing.

Double boom-yah.

(both chuckle) There are still some things we need to figure out.

Just got to get the message across.

Hey, hey, you don't, you don't need to leave these anymore.

Hey, hey, hey! Where are you running to? Who sent you?


Brian, I thought you were gonna talk to your boss.

I am the boss.

Hop Foo's is your restaurant?

Sorry I lied.

You just seemed kind of crazy, so I didn't want to deal.

But you care about conservation.

Oh, I don't, I really don't.

I care about my restaurant.

You're going down, Brian! I'm gonna collect signatures, I'm gonna start a petition, and I will turn it in to the person who's in charge of restaurants.

And I'm gonna report you to the City! Oh, no, not the City.

No! You're a jerk, Brian! I'm gonna burn down your building! I won't do that, I won't do that.

Why do people suck?! Ow! COACH: Okay, we're gonna warm up with music.

(electronic music playing) - Yeah, feeling that? - I guess so.

Yeah, got to loosen up the shoulders.

Wiggle those arms.

(gibbering) - Arms, not your face.

Oh, sorry, thought you said "face.

" Right.

Sexy.

Working out is sexy.

Yeah, it is.

That's not sexy, man.

This is sexy.

That isn't sexy.

Ooh, ay.

Damn it! It's a great workout track! What's next? And time.

Yes! - Yes! - Whoo! - Whoo! Let's do it again.

Again? - Yeah, man.

(grunting): Six, seven, eight.

Come on, man! Mine's broken.

Push through it, man, you got it.

Ah, thank God you're here, Cece.

What's the emergency? Why does Jess need all this Chinese food? No, no, no, I just made all that up.

Wait, you tricked me into getting you food? Yes.

Why? - Nick, what is this? - For after don't worry about it.

I will be right back.

(sighs) Hello zere.

I'm, I'm Cece, I-I remember you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, great memory.

That's what's up, that's what's up.

No doubt.

Diggity.

(sighs) (chuckles) - Nick! - Breasts Ni This is for the food, and there's a little extra for you.

Oh, my God, are you tipping me? - Yeah.

Well, if I'm gonna get in trouble, give it back.

I gave you four bucks.

I'll tip you good I'll tip you right over.

Good stuff.

Yeah, yeah.

Damn, I wish I could have said something else.

"Tip you right over" was good.

Oh, okay, cool.

Uh, is she single? - Yeah, kind of.

Oh, cool, man.

Yeah.

What are you doing? Oh, I'm just gonna it's just a protein boost.

I'm just gonna eat a little.

That's not how it works, dude.

We're still in the middle of our workout.

We're not done yet? - No! Hey, whoa.

I just had a very productive conversation with the owner of the restaurant.

Action has been taken, change is in the air.

Now I'm going to go research lawsuits in my room for fun.

You okay? You seem a little off.

Stop ordering from that place.

Nick, put the dumpling down.

Hey.

Hey, what's up, Jason Street? The Internet said that I had to stay off my feet, but then I found this wheelchair in a ditch, so I'm ready to work out.

Winston, go lay down.

Nick, put the dumpling down.

Relax.

Whoops.

(gasps) Did you just gasp? (laughs) - I'm having one - Down.

I'm gonna ask you again.

Don't Don't do it.

Don't.

D I'm going to eat one bite of this.

Don't do it.

You're better than this.

I don't know if I am.

I might.

.

No.

Don't, don't.

Stop shaking it like that.

Let me eat the dumpling! - What's going on? - BOTH: Oh, just working out.

Yeah.

Just chilling.

(grunts) - Does this food have MSG in it? - JESS: What? (clenched): Oh, my God, MSG makes my jaw lock up.

You all right, dude? - What? - Mm-hmm.

What's going on with your jaw? - Yeah, dude.

(groans) Come on, you son of a Wait a minute.

Ha, "no MSG.

" Where are you going? - I'm just taking Winston for a walk.

Where are you taking me? - I think he needs some fresh air.

BOTH: Aah! Damn it, Coach.

Nick! I want you to really think about your next step.

Why do you care so much? - This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.

By you eating that, you are telling me that you'd rather sit on the couch eating dumplings than do something with your life.

Now, are you a doer or a dumpling-er? I'm sorry, I'm not you, man.

I'm a dumpling-er.

Mmm.

Oh, it's veggie.

I did all that for nothing? I tried.

Where are you taking me? - What? You're my smoking g*n.

Winston's in a wheelchair? What's next, Roberto Benigni coming through the halls, making everybody laugh? (bumps) Aah! Ow! Missing everything.

Take these.

Oh.

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

Don't even talk.

My friend is having an allergic reaction to your food.

Hey, man.

It says "no MSG" on the menu.

It also says it with the what do you call the circle with the diagonal line? - It's the Ghostbusters thing.

What? From the movie Ghostbusters.

Oh, it says it with words an it says it with the Ghostbusters thing.

All right, just calm down.

No, here's what's going to happen.

You're going to stop putting these menus everywhere, or I'm going to show the people in here what happens when you eat the food.

I actually like the food.

Listen, Jess, Chinese food is MSG.

America is living a lie, and we distribute menus so people order the food.

Just accept that that's the way things are! No, I am done accepting things the way they are, because there are menus everywhere, and there are kids who want to see the ocean.

What? - And I don't like your vibe, dude.

(groans) Hey! This is what eating here did to my friend.

Is that crispy noodles? (Coach singing) Coach.

Oh, no, no.

What the hell are you doing, man? - I'm making island beats.

I think this is what I'm gonna do from now on, since, obviously, I can't coach.

I thought we were just messing around.

Why are you taking this so hard? Because, dude, I was trying to prove to myself that I could still do this.

Ever since Malia broke up with me I don't know I've just been a mess.

Feel like I can't do anything right.

(sighs) Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.

Get it together for real.

What are you doing here? I thought you said you were so busy.

I found this extra alarm clock, and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly, so I'll set it up for you guys.

You're welcome.

Wait a second.

What is that? - What's what? - Is that a camera? - Hmm? Schmidt, are you spying on us? So (scoffs) It is it's a camera.

Well, I'm shocked.

Schmidt, look, you decided to move out.

So move out.

I am out.

I'm actually very busy, you know that? I'm actually late for a very important coffee with a with a dear friend of mine.

Who's that? - Hmm? - Who? - Yeah.

Wouldn't you like to know? (door closes) Tiny pants man He don't have friends That's why he got the clock He got the clock to watch his only friends.

Are you enjoying your meal? Winston enjoyed his meal, right? - Until he had an allergic reaction.

MAN: Let's go.

There.

I drove away all of your customers, and I'm gonna do that every day until you stop with the menus.

Earth warrior! - You win.

I'll stop.

Thank you.

Charles? You're fired.

What? No! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Don't f*re him.

He's the menu guy.

I was just trying to make a difference.

You did.

At the beginning of the day, this guy had a job.

Now he doesn't, so congrats on your victory.

You win.

(loud guttural sob) (loud guttural sob) Do you have any teaching experience? (sobs) Does anyone have an antihistamine? You know, I just moved across the hall, but it feels like I moved across an entire ocean.

People grow up, especially young people.

So my friends don't even miss me anymore? Uh-huh.

Well, they don't miss you.

They've moved on.

What? Well, how do you know that? Because he told me.

His name is Conner, and he went to SUNY Binghamton.

I once lived with 40 birds, and they all flew away, and I moved on.

Slow down on the noodles, buddy.

Well, congratulations, Miller.

You were right.

What happened? - I terrorized a restaurant.

I got a good man fired.

I might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair, but I am ashamed of it.

So, that's what you get for trying.

Let's see what the enemy tastes like.

It's good.

Anybody want to help me use the bathroom? - No.

No.

Okay, I'll work it out.

I shouldn't have even tried.

You just get hurt.

COACH: This is such a relief.

I can get fat now.

Hey, guys, stop it! - I want to eat this all day.

Like a Chinese food mÃÂ©nage.

Oh! Okay, you guys are doers, and people like me, people who don't do anything we actually need people like you.

Mmm - Oh, boy, this is bad.

Uh, this Okay, all right.

I'm gonna give you guys a speech, and it's gonna f*re you guys up.

Got some on my pants - First we're gonna start with compliments to build up your confidence.

Okay, uh, - Coach, you're a great guy.

Mmm You've got strong bodies.

Aah! - What? You just need some more clients.

I believe in you.

Thanks.

Jess, you're awesome.

You are the most resourceful, optimistic, amazing person I've ever met in my life.

I can't even get my kids on a field trip.

You can do anything you put your mind to 'cause you're smart, okay? Why can't you get 'em on this field trip? There's no way to get them to the beach.

That's a board.

Karate-kick it! You're not used to making speeches, are you? Point of it is, is you never give up.

(door slams shut) Fine.

I guess you win.

I sort of miss being here.

Well, the nanny cam kind of gave it away.

Well, nobody helped me, so now there is a real mess.

Hey, Winston, do you have some money where we could rent, like, a car or a bus or something? I found this wheelchair in a ditch.

Is anyone gonna tell me anything that's going on? Stop! If it's not an idea about how to rent a car or a van, then I don't want to hear it! Wait a minute.

Nick? That's brilliant! JESS: Boys and girls, transportation provided by Hop Foo's restaurant.

All right, everybody, we did it! Ocean Conservation Day starts now! Welcome to the Pacific Ocean! Yeah.

The large body of water to my left.

No horseplay, guys.

Guys, don't talk to strangers.

And you said it wouldn't fit.

I knew it would fit.

I just didn't want you to bring it.

Careful.

It's got a trick wheel.

I think it's fine.

Okay.

Aah! Trick wheel.

Not fine.

Sorry.

(Nick grunting) Nice wheelchair.

Ms.

Day? - Hey.

Thank you.

Here.

You deserve this.

Oh, thank you.

I love it.

But you know what? I think this actually belongs to Nick Miller, 'cause he did this.

Oh, wow! - Is this your dad? - How old do you think I am, little girl? All right.

I don't want this gift.

It's her favorite hat.

(laughter) - Hey.

Hey.

You made a difference.

How's it feel? It feels good.

(laughs) Yeah, actually, it feels great.

I feel like, um I don't know.

I feel like running.

Hey, Coach, you want to show me how? - How to run? - Come on.

Coach me! Is this right, Coach? Am I doing it right? Miller, you sorry excuse for a human being, you are shaped like a bean bag chair! I will sit in you! - Ah, you can do it.

WINSTON: I'm coming, too.

'Cause I ain't a quitter! Ironside! I'm coming.

I'm com Aah! I am all-terrain, baby.

I was wrong about you, okay? You're not a quitter.

(whooping) Now, please, quit! I'm glad I got to see that.

(laughs) Oh, Schmidt, here's your key back.

We kind of like having you around.

Thanks.

This is just a copy, though.

I have like 50 of them at home.

What are you doing to me? - Your students are burying Winston.

Nah, he likes it.

Get away from me! Where are your parents at? Shoo, children, shoo! Away now, be away! Shut up, Winston! - They are so mean!

Oh! It's Coach! Coach, our old roommate? He wants to hang out tonight.

What?

He just texted me.

Oh, man, you better give Power of Attorney to a loved one, 'cause it's about to get crazy.

When Coach has the dice, every roll's a seven.

Here I am Rock you like a hurricane Nick, trumpet solo.

Yeah! You're ruining my wedding! You know, I bet this means he broke up with Malia.

I mean, that's his thing.

He finds a girl, he just disappears.

Holy crap in a hat! Schmidt! How long have you been out there? Oh, relax.

Just bringing my chimes over to the new loft.

Damn it, Schmidt! You're here all the time taking our stuff.

You decided to move out, so get new stuff.

Oh, I'm sorry that I'm more into material possessions than you.

Schmidt, you stole my toothpaste while I was using it.

That's vindictive.

That's who took the toothpaste? - Yeah.

Uh-oh, you better watch out, break of, break of dawn, because I'm about to party all up in you! - Coach texted you, too? - Yeah, man.

Well, I guess he doesn't realize you're a dill weed who doesn't live here anymore.

Well, I guess he doesn't realize that you're a dill weed who who still lives here.

Remember when you got those chimes, and there was that girl? Yeah.

What's happening? - I don't know.

I don't get it.

I had so much sex on patio furniture.

A lot of fun.

The best.

I'm still mad at you.

I'm mad at you, man! I need everyone to shut up and answer one simple question! You sons a bitches ready to party? Yeah! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Good to have you back, old man.

So, what, uh, you and Malia broke up? Oh, yeah.

She got real fat on me, so I was, like, "Ew.

Bye.

" I guess her gain is our gain! Who are you? - Hey, come Come on, man.

It's me, Jess.

Ah, yeah, no.

We lived together for, like, two weeks.

We shared some pretty big moments.

Yes! We got Bin Laden! - SEAL Team 6, bitches! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Huh.

I thought I was alone for that.

You weren't.

Anyway, I'm single, and me and my boys are gonna get crazy tonight! Huh? You know what I'm talking about, Shrimp Forks.

Oh, man.

Oh, no.

What's Shrimp Forks? It's a name I gave Winston when we played hoops.

The ball used to always slip through his little, small girly hands.

Winston Bishop, point guard Winston Bishop, point guard, R Point guard, R He couldn't palm an apple.

Old Shrimp Forks.

So, I'm thinking strip club tonight? - Hmm? - Oh, fun, fun! Fun! Fun! Uh, Nick, can I talk to you in the other room alone for a sec? Should I close the door, or do you want to just do it quietly? We're not having sex, Nick.

No, I know that.

You wanted to come here and talk.

Yeah.

A strip club on a Tuesday night? No, I know, I know, but this is just what we always used to do.

I don't want to be one of those girls, but I feel kind of uncomfortable about it.

I totally get it.

Let's go, Nick.

These dollar bills aren't gonna stick themselves in a thong.

I'm coming, my man.

Right on.

I might I might be coming, my man.

Oh, I get it.

You're whipped.

No, I'm not.

I know you had to check in with your girlfriend.

We haven't even discussed the girlfriend-boyfriend thing.

Oh, cool, man.

Let's go.

What? What a - I'm sorry, what did I just hear? - What I All I said was we haven't had the girlfriend-boyfriend discussion, which we haven't.

You don't think you're my boyfriend? No, I never said that.

I'm just talking terminology.

We've never had the terminology.

We've never had the terminology.

What? We've never used the terminology.

It's funny you act like you're my boyfriend, you have all the "privileges" of being my boyfriend.

I enjoy them.

Would like me to revoke those privileges? No, you're twisting my words.

What I'm saying, Jess, is we've never had the boyfriend-girlfriend, seeing other people conversation.

We haven't had the seeing other people conversation? You're seeing other people? No, I'm not.

Are you? - No.

Jess, I'm just We haven't had the conversation is all, and it's a conversation that I, personally, would love to have.

Uh, dude, let's go.

It's gonna close.

Geez, is she not letting you go? I'm just telling her what kind of cake to bake me, son.

Oh.

Damn! That's right.

All right.

What are you doing?! - I don't know.

What are you doing?! Jess, it's when Coach is here, - I just - No.

Nick! - I'm really sorry.

Guess what, Nick? I'm going out tonight because we haven't had the boyfriend-girlfriend talk, and we haven't had the seeing other people talk, and I'm gonna bake a cake, a pineapple upside down cake.

In terms of the metaphor, I'm really - Don't! Go to the strip club, Nick.

Knock yourself out.

Oh, don't wait up, Jebecca.

Yeah, it's Jess.

Right on.

Men suck.

Nick isn't even a man.

Mm-mm.

He's like some man-boy, man-child hybrid.

The other day, I had to tell him not to pull a dog's tail.

I shouldn't have to do that.

If a guy wants to play games, Jess, you got to play them right back.

Right, good.

Yeah.

What does that mean? - I'd make him jealous.

Yeah, right, yeah.

And there are a lot of guys out there that want to hook up with you.

There is this one guy, Artie, from the coffee shop who asked me out.

Oh, actually, you have my number.

So give me a call.

Maybe we can go out sometime.

Shut your face! You should maybe give this guy, Artie, a call and see No, that's too real.

That's just way too real.

Then why do you have his number in your phone? I just like looking at it.

It's not weird.

No.

But it has, like a lot of fours in it.

You know, you know what I mean? No, I don't.

Oh, which one of y'all want a lap dance, because WB just h*t the ATM.

Oh, hold up.

Mm-hmm.

Shrimp Forks, why'd you get so much Bunny Money? What is Bunny Money? That is Bunny Money.

That's not real money.

Look at the bill.

President Rabbit with two big ass jugs.

Damn, man.

It's fine.

As long as you didn't take out too much, you're okay.

Hey, Schmidt, I took out $2,000.

You keep making mistakes, Winston.

Oh, isn't this great, guy? - Awesome.

Yeah, man, the best.

And it's gonna keep getting better, because we're not leaving here until the sun comes up.

Whew.

Hey, yo, brick top! We about to get it popping.

Whistle while you twerk! That man has so much confidence.

It's amazing.

Until the morning? I can't do this, Schmidt.

I'm having anxiety here.

I have an 8:00 a.

m.

presentation.

That means I have to get there at 7:45 to lower everyone's chairs.

Jess hasn't texted me back.

I'm starting to freak out.

Here's what I think we should do.

I think you should be the one to just kind of tell him that we want to leave and that maybe you want to leave and then we'll all go together.

Why do I have to be the heavy? All right, fellas! All right, he's back! So I got dancers for each of us, plus one floater to play the zone.

Oh, defense! - Yeah! - Here's a crazy idea.

sh**t, man.

What if we got out of here, went back to the loft and just hung out? You're going through a big breakup.

Let's talk it out, man.

Yeah, yeah, let's just, um, go home and talk feelings.

No.

Mm-mm.

I was with Malia, now I'm not.

There, we talked about it.

Oh, look at the time.

It's butt o'clock.

You whipped.

Shut up, Schmidt.

You whipped.

Straight-up whipped.

I'm not whipped.

Whipped like cream cheese.

Yeah, you are.

Whipped like cream cheese.

Whipped! So, Cece, I'm thinking of f*ring off this text to Nick.

"Loving single life.

" Should I add a "whoo-hoo" or is that too bitchy? Look who I called.

Hey, Jess.

Shut your face.

What? Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.

Barkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze? I call it a Temple Grandin because it makes friendly and compassionate.

I have a boyfriend.

No, she No, she doesn't.

Yeah, I do.

She do.

No.

Obviously, this is a bad time, and, uh, you're involved.

In some shape or other.

No, no, no.

She's free as a bird.

Cece.

All right, well, he's a very lucky man.

I hope he realizes that.

Oh, don't move.

You've got an eyelash.

There we go.

Make a wish.

I'm afraid to.

All right, take care.

Big mistake.

I shook his hand.

I had my fun.

Do you think that Nick is in the strip club right now shaking hands? No.

Because he is a man.

You can't trust them, Jess.

Okay? The moment you let your guard down, they just walk all over you.

Tonight is the night to b*at them at their own game.

Hey, Artie! Bet you can't lift me! Uh, all sales of Bunny Money are final.

How am I supposed to spend $2,000 on dancers? Oh, no.

Our dancers don't take it.

What? - However, uh, Bunny Money is redeemable at the bar, our gift shop and our sister club in Fort Myers, Florida.

What?! Body sh*t.

You taste delicious, do you know that? What is that? An aftertaste? - Probably baby formula.

Oh Tuesday nights! Girl, you are a p*stol.

I'll tell you what, how 'bout you and me go back and I dance on you this time? Oh, man.

Tuesdays nights.

You know, for a chub, you're a terrible heavy.

Let's just get Coach really drunk until he passes out.

Then we take him home.

sh*t contest.

Like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schmidt.

I'm not ripping a page from that pro-n*zi film.

It isn't pro-n*zi.

Of course it is.

It might as well be an SS propaganda movie.

No, everybody in a n*zi uniform literally dies.

Yeah, the When she puts the hand - into the, uh - The heart.

No, not Well, that happens, too.

n*zi.

I don't think that makes you a n*zi.

They ate the monkey brains, and there was all the bugs.

n*zi, n*zi.

Nick's at a strip club, but he's just being a normal guy in his 20s that wants to hang out with other guys in their 20s.

They're all in their 30s.

Hmm.

Yeah.

Enough about Nick.

What do you do when you're not making coffee at the coffee shop?

 Well, actually, I own the coffee shop.

What?

It's not as glamorous as you may think.

It's a lot of spreadsheets and jetting off to Brazil at a moment's notice.

Nick's never been to Brazil.

Maybe you should step away.

You know, call Nick up and hash things out.

Hmm-mm, can't call Nick 'cause then he'll know I'm thinking about him.

Ah.

And then he wins.

Maybe you both win.

Say Brazil again.

Brazil.

Say "rubber baby buggy bumpers."

Rubber babby buggy bumpers.


Oh, my God! sh*t contest isn't working.

It's only making him stronger.

It's Jess.

Hey, Jess, I'm so glad you called! Nick, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, is that, uh, Notorious N.

A.

G.

? - Hey! - Is that Naggie Gyllenhaal? Hey, I don't need your help checking my woman.

You're checking your woman? Wait, how did you hear that? You were covering the listening part, dummy.

Yeah, but they look the same.

I'm too drunk.

Well, I'm way drunk, too, and I'm with a man.

What? He owns a business, and he goes to Brazil.

Nick? - Oh, it's a coin flip.

Hello? He's so immature.

Jess! Jess, I got it.

Hey, I think you guys have had enough.

Why don't you let me give you a ride home? Wait, you weren't drinking? Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink.

I got to get a jump on the morning.

Well, you really have it together.

I bet you can use a phone, too.

Your bar for having it together is set pretty low.

I don't think this is such a good idea.

We can just grab a cab home.

Cece, this was your idea.

Artie, can we take your jet? Oh, it's just one coffee shop.

Wouldn't you like to know? All right, guys, give it up for Candy! Is that lobster gray? Most expensive thing on the menu.

I got to go.

What? Jess is drinking and talking to some guy.

Forget her, dude.

Relationships are prisons.

How often do we get to hang out like this? I haven't seen you in two years.

Strippers and booze forever.

Hear, hear.

There it is.

No, stop, no, no.

Relationships are not prisons, and Jess is amazing.

She's sexy and sweet, and I can't lose her.

So I'm going home to see her.

Why are you crying? We can see each other tomorrow.

I didn't break up with Malia, all right? - She broke up with me.

Why didn't you say anything, man? 'Cause I was embarrassed, Winston.

I lost her.

I was just trying to fill a void with all these naked chicks.

I don't want to be here.

I want to be in love.

Oh, Coach, this is so pathetic.

Now she's dating some dude named Derrique.

Or Derek.

Coach, you need to go home, and I need to go home, too.

You're right, man.

You have to fight for your relationships.

Freaking Derrique.

Let's go.

Mm-mmm, guys, guys, you cannot leave.

Dude, I was just crying.

I want to get out of here.

It's embarrassing.

He cried in a strip club.

All the dudes saw me cry.

Dude, I want to leave.

Man, I got Bunny Money coming out of my pockets.

Wait a minute, this ain't the way home.

Yeah, we're just gonna make a quick stop.

We're gonna kick Malia's boyfriend's ass.

Wait, this is a police station? Uh-huh, that's where he works.

You want to drunk fight a cop? He stole my girlfriend.

Did you hear the joke about the two black guys and two white guys who walked into a police station? - The two white guys came out.

I'm with Winston.

Winston? - Mm-hmm? I got two of these, and you got one more of those.

Put that away.

Coach! Coach, let's do it.

Coach, no! - Let's get raucous.

I'm ready.

We're not ready! - He is pure life force.

He's a lunatic, man.

I got to get out of here.

I want to go, too.

I got a work thing.

Well, I got a girl thing, dude.

Work trumps girls.

Girls are replaceable.

Jobs are forever.

I bet I get left with the fare.

I just bet Hey, driver, let me just ask you something.

Do you like strippers? Do you also like the deal of a lifetime? I wanted to leave first.

I've been saying that the whole night, and none of you guys can stop me.

You think that you can you can b*at me in a physical altercation of fisticuffs? I will b*at you in a way that you've never been beaten before.

Ooh.

Damn it! You got h*t in the face, son.

h*t me again.

'Cause I swear you'll be I'll be Loosen up your neck so I can put you into the headlock of a lifetime.

Guys, it's escalating, look! I'm a cop, pew, pew, pew.

No, no, no, no, no.

Thanks for the ride, Artie.

Bathroom's down the hall.

It's the one with the urinals.

I do live with men.

Nay, boys.

Look, if he can pee in Brazil, he can pee at my house.

Do you actually like this guy? - What? No, no.

Nick couldn't call me his girlfriend, and that hurt.

Now I want to hurt him back with some long, hot conversation.

That's what you really want to do? - Yes.

Men suck, remember? I'm sorry about saying that, because I put that on you, all right? That's because I'm going through something right now with Schmidt.

You have Nick.

Nick's a child who drinks on Tuesdays.

You're drinking on a Tuesday and you are a teacher.

Those kids are watching a movie tomorrow.

Look, Nick doesn't have a life plan.

He doesn't have a day plan.

I once found a note he wrote to himself that said "Put on pants" followed by a question mark.

That means it read, "Put on pants?" Also, he throws pizza at seagulls, which I guess is kind of nice because he's trying to feed them.

And he's a really, really great kisser.

You have something really good.

Just go get Artie and tell him to leave, all right? Can you just get Derek?! Hey! Hey! He's gonna get the whole precinct! This is a high-income area.

They're very bored in there.

Oh, my goodness, this jacket smells like gasoline.

Guys, come on.

Come on, man, we're too old for this.

We're too old for this whole night.

What? Life changes.

You got to grow up.

I did.

I'm in a relationship, and I'm happy.

Schmidt moved out of the loft, and he's happy.

I'm miserable! - It's your fault.

What are you talking about? I'm in a vacancy room! - A room of vacancy! Empty nest! - By choice! By choice! Let me tell you something, when I'm done with you, your face is gonna look all melted like the president at the end of Raiders.

He wasn't a president! You saw a different movie - than everybody else in the world! - I'll k*ll you! - He wasn't a president.

Guys, guys! Kick you in the butt! - Don't! You touched my penis! - Hey, hey! Don't touch my penis! Stop! Stop it! - You just touched my penis! - Hey! Hey! You touched my You guys, grow up! - You grow up.

Grow up! - Coach? What are you doing here? - Is this about Malia? - Yeah, it's about Malia.

Take care of her, man.

Yeah, I will.

I'm a cop, not some drunk loser.

Get out of here.

Should we grow up tomorrow night? Yeah.

Muscle time! - Get on the ground! - Muscle time! - I'm a cop! - Back up! - I got a badge and a g*n! - Arrest me, dude! He's got backup! Go! Go! - Go! Go! - Go! Serpentine! Serpentine! Artie, I have to h*t the hay.

Oh, dear! Don't worry.

I'm gonna make you coffee in the morning.

It's been a really great evening, what a treat it's been, but I think somewhere along the way, some signals got crossed.

Signals could not have been any clearer.

Come on in.

The water's warm.

Are you splashing me? I'm fixing to mix you up.

Seriously? Oh, men are such dicks.

All right, guys, second wind.

You got an old TV? Let's throw it off the roof.

Come on, you're crashing with me.

And you, go talk to your girlfriend.

Thanks.

Hey, it was a fun night.

All right, guys.

Let's go, Shrimp Forks.

Coach, Shrimp Forks? Come on, man, that makes no sense.

I played professional basketball.

You got to stop calling me that.

I'm sorry, man.

Hop along, Bunny Money.

Better than Shrimp Forks.

I'll take that.

Fantastic.

It only cost you $2,000.

It did, didn't it? The Brazilians have the same word for making love to one woman as they do for making love to two.

Mah-gaa-leesh.

Take off your tops and say it with me.

Jess! Oh, my God, that's Nick! Okay, okay, you-you just get him dressed.

I will stall Nick.

I am really good at this kind of thing.

Oh, my God.

Nick, hey, great.

I've been wanting to talk to you about this side table.

What kind of wood is it made out of? Jess, I failed! Jess.

Welcome, brother.

Oh, my God.

Nick, I can't imagine what you must be thinking right now.

Actually, I can.

This is your worst nightmare.

There's a very good-looking man in my bed, and he's naked, and I'm flushed, and I'm flustered.

I might as well just spray paint "Jay Cutler sucks" on the wall and just round out the whole image, right? But, Nick, nothing happened, and nothing was ever going to happen, and you have to believe me, please.

Say you believe me, please.

I believe you.

Do you have any questions? Do you want me to have questions? Well Hey, Artie? I'm gonna need you to get out of my girlfriend's bed, man.

Well, uh, I'm naked and-and in bed, and you're fully clothed and standing, so I mean, I hardly think this would be a fair fight.

Well, I'd like it to be a fair fight.

Thank God for snaps.

Men are so weird.

I must warn you, while spending time in Brazil Let get situated first before we get into this thing.

Oh, my God! - Bye-bye.

Don't die, big guy.

Hey.

Hey.

You called me your girlfriend.

Did I? I don't remember.

Where's Winston with the food? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

It was crazy at the V-Rab.

Bachelor party season.

I got a deep-dish gyrator, no mushrooms.

That's me.

Don't call it V-Rab.

Please.

I got the main stage fish tacos.

No regrets.

Great order.

Pour some sugar on meatballs? - Oh, that's me.

Thank you.

Let's see, and I got the short stack ass-clap pancakes.

You want to switch? - Schmidt, you want a taco? - No, I'm gonna take one of Winston's.

Take it if you want it, dude.

I was just thinking maybe-maybe you guys could chip in a little bit.

'Cause it was expensive.

You want one of Winston's tacos? I'll take 50 cents on the dollar, I really would.

I really would.

Please?

Hey, what took you so long? Come on in.

Hey.

No, no.

Why are we having a secret meeting in an empty loft? Because I don't want Schmidt to find us.

It's creepy, right? - I know, right? - Yeah, it is.

This place gives me the willies, man.

Do you know why they can't keep a tenant in here? - Why? - Because Mrs.

Beverly d*ed on the toilet.

And to come here on Halloween? - Seems risky.

What's risky? The ghost situation.

I brought you guys in here to talk about Schmidt.

I'm really worried about him.

He hasn't been to work for three days.

He just sits on the couch eating cold cuts and yelling at the news about how nothing matters.

It's a problem.

Right.

Be honest, it's a real problem.

He's just going through a whole thing, you know? The Cece-Elizabeth breakup has gotten to him.

Right now he is completely unhinged.

Y'all feel that? - What is going on? Not saying there's a ghost, but I felt a weird breeze go through my body, - that's all I'm saying.

There's no ghost.

Guys, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss the old Schmidt.

I want him to be happy again.

He's crumbling before our very eyes.

And I'm having a party tonight, and I just can't have him lying on the couch, wiping his tears with deli meat.

I'll talk to him, okay? - Thank you.

People get weird with breakups.

Trust me, I got this.

You got this.

That was Winston.

Was that you or was that in here, dude? - That was Don't do that! Oh, come on, Obama.

t*nk pull in, t*nk pull out.

Babies are born, old people die.

And yet the world keeps spinning and spinning and spinning, and one day, it stops.

And then what? You want you want to talk about health care? That's mayo, buddy.

Yeah, I don't got this.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.

Season 3, Episode 6 "Keaton" - Pumpkining - You're really good at that.

Thanks, man.

Yeah.

What are you carving there? - It's a pumpkin.

Oh, look at that.

That's beautiful.

My pumpkin! - Pumpkin doesn't matter.

Hey.

I just wanted to talk to you, um - About my party tonight.

You don't want me to come to the party? No, no, no, no, no, no.

Jess, do you not want me to come to your party? - No.

I No.

Doesn't matter.

I wouldn't go if I weren't throwing it, you know? It's, like, more of a business-networking It's not a big deal at all.

I just won't come.

I'll stay at home, and I'll just hang out in my costume.

Oh, wait a minute.

Your home is my home.

See you at the party.

What the hell? - He's a total maniac.

Well, you know what, Jess? He doesn't get like this often.

But when he does, oh, there is an option.

Nick, I think it's time for Schmidt - to get a letter from an old friend.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

What old friend? - Forget you heard anything.

What old friend? - Nothing, J - We need him, Nick.

No, we don't.

We got to bring him back.

Bring who back? - Winston, don't do this! - Guys, does nobody listen to me?! - without him! - Who is he? - Michael Keaton.

You stupid Michael Keaton, the actor? The Batman? Nick, are you gonna tell her, or should I? - I'm not telling her.

Fine.

I'll do it.

You will? - When Schmidt was seven years old You're a terrible storyteller.

I'll just do it myself, I guess.

When Schmidt was seven years old, his daddy divorced his mommy And Schmidt was left without the love of a father.

He didn't take it well.

He began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate.

Mrs.

Schmidt tried everything to cheer him up, but nothing worked.

Desperate, she looked to the stars.

Movie stars.

Mrs.

Schmidt wrote that little fat loser a letter of support from the star of his favorite movie, Batman.

But not the confusing new one.

The good one, with Michael Keaton.

And when Schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands on Keaton's letter, his life changed forever.

Yes! But the real trouble was just beginning.

You see, Schmidt wrote back.

And he kept writing back about any problem he faced: bullies, schoolwork, public erections.

And for every letter he sent, Michael Keaton sent one back.

Was Winston's version shorter? Then one day, that tubby goon went off to college.

Whoa.

So Mrs.

Schmidt unloaded the secret on her son's only friend, a man named me.

It was me.

Yeah, I got that.

Really? People don't No, I got it.

College proved tough for Schmidt, and old patterns soon returned.

It became impossible to study, and I knew what I had to do.

And again - New message.

It worked.

With Keaton in his corner, he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey - and became a man.

One He lost five pounds, gained confidence with women and he saw the h*t movie Multiplicity - 25 times.

Oh, my God.

You've been cat fishing Schmidt.

Do you think we could use this whole Michael Keaton thing - to turn Schmidt around? - Absolutely.

Great! - But I won't do it.

Why not? - Because I put it to bed, okay? It's over.

He'll do anything Keaton says.

The letters are too powerful.

I'm lying to my best friend.

And I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.

Well, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick? Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.

But I won't do it.

Sorry.

You think you tell that story better than me? Look, you leave out way too many details, man.

You don't just say he was chewing a candy bar.

You say he was chewing on a nougat-y candy bar.

That's not the kind of writer I am.

I don't say words like "nougat-y.

" I'm simple.

I'm like Hemingway.

Hey, Cece.

Oh, hey.

I came to find out if you're coming to my party today.

You never answered my e-mail.

Yeah, I meant to, uh to tell you I can't make it.

Sorry.

Um I've been going out drinking a lot lately.

It's kind of wiping me out.

Please come to my party, Cece.

It's Schmidt, you know? - I don't think I'm ready for that, so - Yeah.

What if I could promise you Schmidt wouldn't be there? Who wants candy? - Did you go trick-or-treating? - No.

I was out, I had my errand tote, and a couple of neighbors gave me candy.

Is that trick-or-treating? Yes, that's the definition of trick-or-treating, Jess.

Hello! Uh, Jess, I'd like you to know that I've changed my mind, and I won't be coming to your party tonight.

I've been e-mailing with an old friend of mine, and he made me realize - that I should give Cece her space.

An old friend, huh? Well, Nick knows.

You know, I don't like to throw his name around because I don't like people treating me any differently, but It's Michael Keaton.

What?! Uh, okay.

Calm down.

The actor?! Seriously, you guys.

Don't treat me any different.

He's kind of my friend.

Michael Keaton.

There was one time he e-mailed me.

He said he was my best friend.

Anyway, we have so much catching up to do, me and Michael, so just enjoy the night.

That's crazy, Schmidt.

Ah, man.

What did you do? - Jessica Damn Day.

I just got Schmidt to not come to the party.

Keaton hasn't written Schmidt in three years.

We have no idea how Schmidt is gonna react.

If Schmidt finds out Keaton isn't real, it'll destroy the entire life he has built around him.

We are talking about a Truman Show situation.

Oh, yeah, I love that movie.

What part are you talking about? Well, I'm talking about the part in the movie when Truman realizes that his whole life is a lie, and then he goes crazy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there in the middle of the movie.

No, it's the whole movie.

Oh, yeah, I know, I was just 'cause there's the one - There's like a scene.

You haven't seen it.

He didn't see the movie.

Okay, guys, he almost found out once.

Now, luckily, I handled it.

I don't understand.

In 1995, he told me specifically that he had never been to Nicaragua.

It doesn't make any sense.

Aah! You have no idea what you've done.

Hey, uh, you guys, do you think that it's too early to e-mail Michael back? Should I send him an e-card? Does that change anything, or does that change everything? - I think you're overthinking it.

You know what? - You're right.

You're right.

Be cool.

I think I'm way too up here, all upstairs.

Got to bring it down here to here.

Not any lower, though.

It's not like that.

I know it's not.

Bro, it's not like that.

No one thinks it is, bro.

Cool.

All right.

He's already getting weird.

Here.

No, Je You come to the master.

What are you writing? I fixed it again.

You're welcome again.

So you just wrote from Keaton, "I'm going on vacation"? He would never write that, Jess.

Why not? - Vacation?! Oh, Michael, you stop going away.

I knew this would happen.

Hey, Schmidt.

Schmidty.

He left me again.

It makes sense.

Why would a guy like Michael Keaton be friends with me anyway? I'm sure he likes you a lot, Schmidt.

Why would he? I guess I'll just always be the fat boy who eats fat-boy cheese.

I didn't want to have to do this.

Oh, is that really necessary, Nick? - Shh.

What? Let him work.

I'm kind of like his Robin.

You're not like my Robin.

You want to be Robin? He doesn't have all the responsibilities of Batman, but he can take some of the glory.

Robin's a joke.

Robin's the joke.

I think we can all agree.

The kids look up to him, you know, in the community.

I haven't been inside Keaton's mind in a long time, and I need my proper inspiration.

Thank you.

Why do you have a picture of a bear? The great Michael Keaton att*cks each new role with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear.

It is his entire acting philosophy, which I totally made up.

I sleep with this person.

Speak to me, Keaton.

Mmm.

Here we go.

Oh, hey, Nick, that's incredible.

"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it"? Yes, I stole that from Nelson Mandela.

I added the part about the Penguin and the Riddler.

Oh.

All right.

Is that him? Did it work?

He wrote back smiley face.

He wrote back smiley face.

He wrote back smiley face.


Trick or treat!

Oh, how adorable.

You know, I just got a treat, too.

It's not candy; I'm not a Not a dumb little baby like all of you.

"Happy Hallow's Eve.

" And send.

Just give us our candy.

Hush, little boy.

He wrote back.

"Hi.

" - Okay, I got this.

"Speak to me, old chum.

"I canceled my trip to provide earthquake relief.

This seemed more important.

" Boom.

That's so good.

Yeah, it's pretty good.

You really have the Keaton voice down.

"You're a friend for life.

" - That's good.

"M.

K.

" - I think that's good.

I think that's really good, actually.

Hi.

Welcome.

Happy Halloween.

Drinks are over there.

Hey.

Hi.

What are you supposed to be? - I'm Joey Ramona Quimby.

I don't get it.

Joey Ramone a Quimby.

What are you? You look like you're just wearing trash from your car.

No, I'm not.

I'm the Paper Mountain Trash King I just got trash from my car.

And now the man who once played center for the New York Knicks in the nude, David Letterman! - That is a terrible Letterman.

Really? People at work tell me I look just like Dave.

You look just like Letterman.

You know, I have always thought that.

What, uh, what uh, Nick, Nick Miller.

So you a, uh? You're a - What is that? - That's, that's his laugh.

He's never done that.

That's his laugh.

Do you like my costume? I'm a public serpent.

Um, I thought you weren't coming.

Oh, I changed my mind.

You know, I reread a few of Keaton's e-mails.

He can be quite cryptic.

I think what he meant when he said that life was meaningful was really, "Go to the party.

" - I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.

I know Keaton best.

Hey, Winston, by the way, great costume.

Maya Angelou.

Crap.

What am I gonna do? Cece's on her way.

Schmidt is rereading e-mails.

Do you know what happens after rereading? Figuring it out.

It's The Truman Show.

Truman Show, man, I love that movie.

I'm not convinced you've ever seen it.

I have; it's about the Civil w*r.

Batcave? - Go, go, go, go, go.

Go, go, go.

Winston, go to Cece's and stall.

Okay, fine.

But I got to h*t the little King of the Late Night Talk Show's room first.

Maybe slow down on that.

You're not great with booze.

Hey, I got it, I got it.

You got it? Good.

Um, "You're in grave danger.

Leave where you are immediately.

" - Send.

Okay.

Don't! - You just sent that? - Yeah.

A team has to talk about a decision before you h*t send.

Sorry.

I thought it was a really good move.

Trick or treat.

Shh.

All right, you got to fix this.

I'll meet you at your building in 30 minutes.

Terrible! Send.

No! - What? Now what are we gonna do? - You told him Keaton was coming here? - No, Nick.

Are you out of your mind? - It's a stall! It's a stall Until we can come up with a better plan.

Well, who the hell is that? - I don't know.

Trick or treat! You.

I don't get what you're doing! Are you drunk? A little.

What's your endgame here? - It's Halloween night.

This is the night when anyone can dress up in a costume and be anybody that they want.

Would you listen to your woman voice for one second? Oh, you think I'm gonna talk to him in a woman voice when I'm talking to him? No, I have a character.

You're doing a character? Well, I'd love to hear it.

I'm the Batman.

Oh.

Right? So good.

What, am I in the movie theater, eating popcorn? Jess, you're also five, four.

Keep going further away.

The further you're away, the bigger you look.

I would say run a little bit.

Nick! Jess, go! Go - Hey.

Uh, Nick.

Hey.

By chance, have you seen anyone famous in the vicinity? This vicinity? Famous? Like, um - Look that way.

What? - Oh, my God.

Yeah, it's unbelievable.

Well, it's my hero.

Yeah.

That is Michael Keaton.

Right there.

Why is he wearing his costume from the movie he did 24 years ago? If he wore the outfit from Clean and Sober, you wouldn't recognize him.

I'm the Batman.

It's Halloween.

Don't overthink it.

Well, you saw him.

There he is.

Let's get out of here.

I have to meet him, Nick.

I have to.

No, you don't have to meet him.

No, no, no You're a great kid, Sch You're a great kid, Schmidt.

No.

Let me take you out to eat.

I want to buy you something - 'cause you met your hero.

Go to an all-night diner.

No, I have to meet Got to meet him.

He's got to - It's Michael Keaton! - Go get a blintz or two! Aah! - Michael! It's me Schmidt.

See you later, Michael! Take off! We have so much to talk about.

Our heroes are never who we want them to be! Oh.

Oh.

You met him.

It's Keaton.

Come on, you guys.

I know.

I've known the whole time.

What, do you think I'm stupid? No.

It just I Just don't really know what to say in this situation.

Look, please don't blame Nick.

It's not his fault.

You should be ashamed of yourselves.

How dare you hack into the private e-mail account of one of our nation's finest actors! I'm gonna have to tell Michael about this.

No! No! - No, don't tell Michael! - Jess, please stop.

Thank you for what you're trying to do, but it's over.

It has to be over.

Schmidt, I'm Michael Keaton.

I'm the owner of the e-mail address KeatonPotatoes@aol.

com.

What? It was me The whole time.

No - No, you can't - How do you think I know that you kissed the bus driver at spring break? Or that you want to open up a glassware boutique in Connecticut? - Or about the wall hole? - This is impossible! I've been I've been writing with Michael Keaton since I was a kid! Your mother came up with the idea, Schmidt.

But since college, it's been me.

My mom? You're gonna tell me that my mom helped me with my public erections? I drew pictures! He didn't want you to find out this way.

Hey.

I got to go.

Wait.

Schmidt! - Oh! Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

Uh - A bully! Get him! Oh! Oh! - Come on.

Hey, kids, get out of here! Scat! Scat! Back off! Cece, wait.

I swear, I did not know he was gonna be here.

I'm so sorry.

No, Jess.

It's-it's fine.

Okay, it's fine.

In fact it's actually kind of perfect.

I think, since this whole thing went down, I've just been running away.

You know, I mean, actually seeing Schmidt, I I finally feel like I have some closure.

Well, good.

I'm glad.

You deserve some.

So let's f*re up the Batman Mobile, go to a taco stand and eat some feelings, okay? Okay, I just I think it's Batmobile.

Batman Mobile.

No.

Batmobile.

That's what I said Batman Mobile.

You're putting the man There's no man.

It's just Bat - Batman Mobile.

Mobile.

Batman Mobile.

Batmobile.

Drop the man.

Bat Yeah.

Batman Mobile.

Batmobile.

Batmo-mobile.

So it was you who helped me through my first breakup with Elizabeth? Yeah, Schmidt.

And it was you, not Keaton, who told me that women aren't attracted to men who wear maternity pants? Yes, but that one I feel like I shouldn't have had to.

They're unbelevably comfortable.

What about that time that we saw Michael Keaton at that deli, and he stopped, and he winked? Honestly, I can't explain that one.

It was just the weirdest day of my whole life.

My friend Michael.

Oh, Schmidt, look, I know this is hard, okay? But honestly, I was just trying to help.

You don't need Keaton.

You got me.

What was that? - I'm so sorry.

What Why would you say something like that? Because I hurt you, and I've been wanting to fix this for years.

The end of a high school football movie? I'm really sorry I pretended to be Keaton for the last 12 years.

It's super weird.

Are we good? Yeah.

We're good.

Well, Nicholas, I came to a decision last night.

I'm entering a new chapter in my life, and I think it best that I do it alone.

You're going to one of those weekend spas again, buddy? No.

In the famous words of singer-songwriter Billy Joel - Don't do this.

I'm moving out.

You're the worst.

Schmidt, I thought you said we were good.

No, we're great, but I'm going.

Two separate things.

I made the call this morning.

I got a new place.

I'm out.

You're not going anywhere.

I'm going.

Goodness, uh, I think somebody had sex in my bedroom last night.

I think that because they're still in there - Having sex, I think.

Ugh! Hey, Schmidt.

You going to a weekend spa again? - No.

Striking out on my own.

Wait.

What?! You're moving out? He's not moving out, is he? Schmidt, you can't move out.

Who's gonna do my fades? Yeah, who's gonna do his fades? Believe this is mine.

Well, I bid you all adieu.

Stop it, Schmidt.

Oh, Schmidt! - Are you serious? - Schmidt, come on.

Come on.

Seriously? Come on! - Stop with the show! You can't even fit all your socks in that suitcase.

Get your last looks, 'cause who knows when we'll see each other again? Or where.

Wait.

You're just moving in across the hall? I can't hear you 'cause I'm gone.

Schmidt, it would take me longer to walk from the kitchen to the bathroom than it would from here to where you are.

Oh, you are kidding me.

I can see your feet! - Me, too.

Shut up.

Guy's an idiot See you tomorrow, Schmidt Woo! I'm alone! I'm alone! I'm alone I'm alone Score, touchd Hahaha Yeah.

Shut up, Winston.

Damn, man.

You look tired.

Your eyes are puffy as hell.

I'm unwell, Winston.

I'm just torn up about this whole Cece and Elizabeth thing.

I feel so guilty, I can't even look at myself in the mirror.

Do you think that I'm good person? I'm gonna Hey, guys, do you guys think that I'm a good person? You're a terrible person.

It's hilarious.

You cheated on my best friend, Schmidt.

F-Fair enough.

Okay.

Well, I'm better than Winston.

You're better at things than Winston, but he's a better person.

Winston freakin' stinks! - Okay, why am I being dragged into this? Because I'm mad, Winston.

And I'm tired.

And I'm a good I'm a good man.

Are you crying? I got a package for Nick Miller.

There's nobody here by that name.

I got this.

I saw that.

Run, Nick! Run! - Aah! What? Relax, I'm with your late father's estate.

Pop-pop? - This is for him.

What's in there? It's a hand, isn't it? Just tell me if it's a hand.

Oh, my God! - It is a hand.

It's a I knew it.

It's a hand.

What does that mean, though? Full of dollar bills, y'all! You are rich, man! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess I can't believe Nick's dad left him $8,000.

I've never seen someone burn through money so fast.

I should say something.

Some of these shoes aren't even his size.

Look, Jess, you don't want to talk to Nick about money, okay? It is a very touchy subject.

I'm gonna check out this fancy picture place.

Seems like rich guys always have pictures of themselves.

My man.

Do you, baby.

I'm gonna be honest with you.

Nick owes me is my opportunity to get it back.

How are you expecting to get your money back if he bl*ws it all on stupid stuff? Oh, don't worry, Jess.

I have a plan.

Hey, listen, you know you don't have to con him if he actually owes you money.

You can just ask him.

I just told you to ask him for the money.

Smile Do the crystals make it look too glamorous? It's really glamorous.

I don't even know.

I don't know what's cool anymore.

It could be a good time to start a bank account.

Yeah, or I could just flush it down the toilet.

It's not really the same thing, but A bank is just a paper bag but with fancier walls.

That's all it is.

I'm gonna keep my money where my mouth is.

Um, under my nose.

That saying actually does work.

What is that? - This is my box.

It's where I keep all my junk that I don't feel like dealing with.

That looks like a lot of bills.

It's mostly bills.

Like I said, it's junk.

You know, I'm just brainstorming here, but what if you paid some of those bills with the money you just got? Yeah.

I'm gonna "pay my bill.

" And what's next? I'm gonna go to the doctor and get a checkup.

Give them $500 to check my bones.

You're being funny.

So, yeah, I was dating both of them at the same time.

I'm a mess.

I can't sleep.

I urinate constantly.

I cried the other day listening to a techno song.

My tweets have been extremely literal.

Were the girls Jewish? One Indian, one regular.

Do you want to see a picture? I-I don't even know why you're here.

You come in and say, "Do you have a minute?" Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Rabbi.

It's just that Okay, it's much more simple.

How can I be a better person? Oh.

Well, you seem awfully concerned with yourself.

You might want to start thinking about the needs of others.

I think about others all the time.

What-what I can get from them, how they can give me pleasure, do they have a silly little walk - that I can make fun of? - No, th-that's It's where you actually care about somebody else.

You put their needs ahead of your own.

This is one of the few times that I wish I was Catholic.

Couple Hail Marys and I'd be off the hook.

Huh? Oh, God.

Whoa.

Are you choking? You're choking.

Okay.

Uh What, are you biking and eating? All right, I got you, I got you.

Come on! Live! Live! Live, biker! - Ew.

Yeah! - Thank you.

You saved my life.

What? You saved my life.

You saved my life.

I did.

Yes.

Yes.

Thank you Thank you Yes! Dude! This is exactly what I needed.

Oh, my God.

Let us rejoice in song.

Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil Adonai Eloheinu - Please call 911.

I'm hurt.

Oh, yeah, no, that's a great idea.

I'm gonna call 911.

I hope you don't have a dance recital later.

I'm just kidding.

Don't look at your legs.

That's, uh, $900 to the Parking Authority of Los Angeles.

Oh, is it okay to mail cash? I'm gonna do it anyway.

All right, it's on its way.

Sliders are beautiful.

I know, man.

I knew you would think that.

I love 'em, dude.

That's why I made 'em.

What is that? Brotherhood.

Brotherhood, man.

All right, man.

I respect you, man, no matter what.

That's what it's about, man.

Yeah, and, um in the spirit of brotherhood just 'cause we on that level right now I was just thinking - maybe, I don't know, um - Anything, man.

sh**t.

Oh, man.

Maybe you can just pay me back that money that you owe me.

Remember? 'Cause you owe me that money? - Uh, Nick? Nick? - Oh - Nick? Nick? Hey, Nick.

Oh, you stink! - Um, can we? - You son of - You son of a bitch, Winston! - Can we can we That's what this is about?! Nick, it's my money, okay?! Give it back to me! I make a little bit of money and you come slipping out of the "woodword"! You mean "woodwork"? What is "woodwork"?! What's "woodword"?! Wood! Word! Wood! Word! That's where people like you come crawling out of when people like me have money! - But you owe me that money! - Stay out of my damn box - is the point, man! - I'm not in your box! Jess gets it, right? Yeah, what's What the hell, dude? I'm gonna go to the bar to blow off some steam.

That's a great idea.

Go get loaded.

You deserve it.

Black out.

You are the only one that I trust around here.

Oh You went through Nick's box.

Look, it was so much worse than I thought.

Why does he have the deed - to an old Mercury Cougar in there? - Oh, yeah, he lost that.

For crying out loud, where is it? We've been looking for hours.

It's done.

What about your car, Nick? I said it's done.

I'll just get the money back.

Bill collectors are reasonable people, right? - That makes sense.

You better keep your mouth shut! I'll make you a deal.

I'll keep my mouth shut if you pay me the money Nick owes me.

Are you trying to blackmail me? You don't scare me, Jess.

How much does Nick owe you? $1,900.

But what is money anyway? You know, it's just paper that some king on the mountains said was worth something.

You know? Gold, I understand.

It's shiny and you can make jewelry out of it.

Silver? Put a werewolf in front of me, he's d*ad.

Brass creates the bells that make sound throughout the land.

But we k*ll each other for paper.

I gotta tell you, man, that's sad.

You give me $50, I'll show you my private parts.

Nicholas, good yontef.

Are you well? - No, but good yontef.

You know, I'm all steamed up.

This money thing is tearing me apart, Schmidt.

All right, if it's bothering you that much, why don't you just give it away? Son of a bitch! Not, not to me, Nick, to charity, or tzedakah as my people call it.

That's what your people do? - Yeah.

You beautiful genius.

I like that.

That frees me of my worries.

Oh, look at that! Another mitzvah! I'm two for two today.

Yeah! Mitzvah! - I saved a man.

You know, there was a lowly bike messenger.

Was just riding along, choking on his gum.

And I performed Heimlich's maneuver on him, rescued him.

Great.

Yeah, who's the good man now? You're almost forced to admit it.

Almost You're almost forced to admit it.

Yeah, I know.

I'm a hero, Nick, now Just tell me that I'm a good man.

I really need to hear it.

I don't even know if I'm a good person.

I'm not the guy to ask.

I have my moods.

But we're not talking about you.

We're talking about me right now and how I'm a good person, so it'd be really nice if you could say that.

I'm ready to do a tzatziki.

Tzedakah.

This is not about tzedakah right now.

This is about me being a good man and you telling me that.

Absolutely.

So, well, say it.

You got it.

S-Say that I'm a good man.

I'm giving away my money.

I've been trying to listen - to you this whole time! - Damn it, Nick, you are so drunk right now - and at the bar you work at, no less.

Yeah.

What happens with the rest of your day? Do you even think about that? You don't understand drinking at all.

Don't go.

Heathcliff.

Hi, I'd like to unpay some parking tickets.

Excuse me? - Well, I sent in a payment earlier for some tickets and I decided I don't want to pay them.

Well, just cancel the checks.

Can't do that 'cause I paid cash 'cause my boyfriend doesn't believe in banks.

It's early in the relationship.

Still shaving above the knee if you know what I mean.

Mm-hmm.

Let me get this straight You want me to watch the mail and let you know if I see anything from your boyfriend.

Exactly.

Fantastic.

Should I call you or? - Text, text would be great.

Perfect.

Let me put your number into my phone.

I didn't give you my number yet.

Oh, I think you did.


It's your lucky day, old friend.

I had an interesting talk with Schmidt, and I've decided to give away my fortune.

So, what do I owe you? - How much money d? Uh - Hey, guys, what's going on? Hey, Jess, um It's tzatziki is what it's called.

It's a Jewish charity.

Nick was just about to pay me the money that he owes me.

Wait! Come on, what are you doing? I'm, uh, I'm lubing up, Sally From ankles to ears? The door's locked You want me to bust in? Son of a It opened! Where are you? Um, I just was hot, I wanted some shade.

Oh, done that.

He take my money? Winston! It was me, it was me, it was me.

I'm so sorry, I went through your box I just couldn't help it and I paid some of your bills, and I'm so sorry I Hey, Nick You gonna leave me here? Nick That's fair.

There he is, alive and well.

Yeah.

Mazel.

I br-brought you these.

How's my brave little soldier doing, huh? Not great.

They said that I'm never gonna be able to ride a bike again, - so there goes my job.

Sure, sure.

Do you think that I'm a good person? I I don't really know you.

Well, what more do you need to know? If not for me, you probably would have d*ed today.

Well, somebody probably would have come along.

Just say that I'm a good person.

Well, I mean - Why is that so hard for you to say? - Ow! - I'm sorry.

I am so sorry.

You're, you're a good person.

I am? You really think so? Very good.

Thank you for saying that.

Yeah.

That really means It means a lot.

I finally feel like I can breathe again.

Good.

What happ What happened to him? Well, he got smoked by a bus while he was having a bake sale for cancer kids.

For, for canc for cancer kids? - Yeah.

But he-he's, he's a great person.

Bad things happen to good people all the time.

Of course they do.

What am I even chasing here? What is the point of being a good person? Some say moral integrity is the cornerstone to humanity.

What do you know, you idiot? You choked on a piece of gum today.

Hey, man, don't sh**t the bike messenger.

That is a terrible joke! And none of this makes any sense! Hey, Nick.

Look, I know you're really angry and you have a right to be.

I have the right to be? I mean, why do you feel like you need to fix me? It's like you think you know better.

Well, I m I might know better than you.

Did you start a corporation? - Was it Fat Face? - I think so.

Yeah.

Well, you're getting taxed like crazy.

Well, that's because I thought I was filing a patent.

Fat Face is an invention? Kind of in its intention It was suppo it - Are you a lifeguard? - No, that is a false certificate.

Just a classic beach prank.

That seems dangerous.

It's funny, 'cause I I can't swim.

Everyone was watching me, and I'm like, "I don't know" I was 13! I was 26.

This is the problem with the box.

It's my private stuff.

You've never once done jury duty or paid your taxes.

Not until gay marriage is legal everywhere.

I stand by that.

And I don't want to do jury duty or pay taxes.

Nick, you're in so much debt, it's crazy.

You have to deal with this stuff.

No, I don't, Jess, it's in my box.

That's not true, though.

It's not a perfect system, Jess, but it's mine, okay? And it's private.

Well, I'm sorry I went through your damn box, but I was just trying to help you, Nick.

So maybe I'll try to help you.

What if I went into your box? Not that.

Stop it! - I like that box, but I'm mad at you! I'm back to "You disrespected me.

" - I was just trying to help.

Well, then, how about this Two can help.

Okay? And if two are going to help, then I'll be one of them 'cause two can tango on this dance, okay? So, you want to waltz? Well, you picked the wrong dance partner.

Two can play.

What? It's not a Who needs changing, huh, who needs fixing? I'm gonna go through your personal drawers and see what needs changing.

What are you, a zoo elephant? Those are my night peanuts.

There shouldn't be day peanuts and night peanuts! They're just peanuts! I'm sorry, why is that weird? You just have a bunch of boxes? I would change that.

Oh, you have a bunch of metal toothpicks.

They're bobby pins.

What's a bobby pin? - It keeps your hair back.

You need Bobby's pins to put your hair up? It's bobby pins, not Bobby's pins.

What is this?! - Yarn.

What are you knitting, a mansion?! Oh, look at this.

What do we have here? A bunch of b*at-up old sacks.

My vintage purses.

Well, you know what? - They could be sexier.

You want my purses to be sexier? Would it k*ll you to get something sleek, covered in gems for once? You want my purses to be covered in gemstones? All guys do! That's what we think is sexy! We want to be playing a saxophone in an alley and have you walk by in a miniskirt with a purse with gems.

But you girls don't listen! - What?! - Changing! - No! Nick, no! - This all is changing.

No, no, stop! That's disrespectful! - Gone! - Nick, stop it! No! This is the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life! - I got that for a nickel.

It's disgusting.

You're just trying to get a rise out of me.

Oh, my God! I've gotten a lot of compliments on that one.

Gone! - Nick! What? Stop it! Look, I like you the way you are.

I'm just asking you to grow a little.

Are we ever gonna get to a point where you stop working on me? Instead of changing me, maybe once, Jess, see it my way.

Well, your way's crazy and illegal.

This is me, take it or leave it.

I'm not changing for anyone.

Hey, where are you going? If you have something to say, just say it.

Don't write me a note or That's the money I spent.

Do what you want with it.

Thank you.

Couple of best friend horses.

That's neat.

What else can you get on? It doesn't make any sense.

Can you not see I'm in the middle of a bar mitzvah class here? Yeah, well, they should hear this.

A man helping cancer kids got creamed by a bus today.

Everything happens for a reason.

But what if it doesn't happen for a reason? Maybe Maybe there aren't any good guys and bad guys.

Maybe there are just winners and losers.

I was b*ating myself up, but maybe I should Maybe I should have been celebrating.

Have you ever dated two women at once? - What are you talking about? I went to camp They used to call me the Octopus.

Clearly, you have not, sir.

That's enough.

You get out of here right now! - Out.

Don't you "out" me.

Get out, get - Getting a little handsy there, Rabbi.

Get out! - You know what I realize? Nothing matters, and that's great.

You know why? Because if nothing matters, we can do whatever we want, Rabbi.

Avram! Julio! Get away from me, man.

Kick his ass! All right, okay.

YOLO! YOLO! Nick's right.

I have too many purses.

You're addicted to purses.

I'm addicted to development fluid.

I get it.

This one's for meat, and this one's for shells.

You know what? - Keep them.

They're yours.

Okay, thanks.

Also, heads up The ass of your pants is missing.

It's for the kitty cats.

My phone's ringing.

Sure.

Hello? I'm like a pretty lady.

What's happening? I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Day, but this man was trying to open an account with a check in your name and a paper bag full of money.

Would you please stop hovering? I'm being cooperative.

It's fine.

He's okay.

Thank you, though.

Opening a bank account, huh? Yeah, I, uh - I realized something.

What? I'd do anything for you, Jess.

Hey.

Thank you.

All right, Mr.

Miller, your checking account is good to go.

Oh, there's just an eight dollar processing fee.

Eight dollars? That's a very specific amount.

That's fine It's your world, your rules, so Excellent.

You go to the castle, you got to pay the king.

What is processing? What does that mean? It's just a word you use to make more money off of us.

That makes me mad! - Me, too, yeah.

Hey, how about this? What's a bank? - Yeah.

It's just a paper bag - That's right.

Yes! - with walls.

You're making some really, really, really good points, ma'am.

You are the puppeteers that puppet the world.

No more banks! Or some banks I don't care! But I want my money on a boat! I understood at least 30% of the financial crisis, and guess what I got from that? - You suck! - Yeah.

You suck so hard.

And now, I'm gonna process this man's face, 'cause I think he's great.

And I'm crazy about him.

Fine, I'll waive the fee.

Yeah! We won eight dollars! Just wait till you have children.

You'll never touch each other again.

Banks suck! Banks suck! What the hell happened to you? Got b*at up by some rabbis.

Well, Winston, we're all alone.

Nothing matters.

But you know what? Look Schmidt, stop, all right? You're a good man.

You did a bad thing doesn't make you bad.

We just have to try to be better, you know? Been waiting all day for somebody to tell me that.

I I really appreciate it.

Thank you.

I want you to have something.

Winston, literally, a gift is the last thing I des - This is - There you go.

This is a candelabra.

Yeah.

I bought it with the money that Nick owed me.

This is what you spent it on? - And now it's yours.

Uh-huh.

May it illuminate your path and lead you out of the darkness.

That's what it says on the bottom.

May it illuminate your path, lead you out of darkness.

Uh, uh, thank you for this really.

Look at it every single day and tell yourself "I'm a good person," 'cause you are.

You know what I might do, though? And it might seem like the opposite, but what I'm actually thinking is, maybe I'll just put it away somewhere, like in I don't know in the back of my closet so to keep it away from thieves.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Can you be honest with me real quick? - Mm-hmm.

How many times did you rub this thing and think a genie was gonna come out? I ain't gonna lie to you man.

I rubbed it, like, three times.

Yeah.

I thought so.

You know, I'm not If a genie did come out, what would you wish for? - More candelabras.

Yeah, I bet.

That is how you have sex, America.

Yeah.

Yeah.

What's happening here is amazing.

Like, I want to film it, but I don't want to film it 'cause that would be p*rn.

And that time, I think I figured out what that thing underneath the thing was.

Yeah, you did.

And whoa, right? Yeah, whoa.

Hey, should we take a break and, like, talk about our childhoods or something? You know, get in there, get into it, get into each other's heads.

Dreams, thoughts, fears, feelings.

If Yeah I mean No? I'm gonna throw a curveball.

I'm gonna go banana it and then I'll be ready for round two.

Define "banana it.

" Eat a banana? Oh, good.

I was worried for a second.

What are Nick and Jess doing in there, and how is it this loud? Nick's body is so soft, it should absorb sound.

They're just getting warmed up, Schmidt.

It's a whole new ball game around here.

You, see, you wouldn't know that 'cause you haven't been here in weeks, but now that you're single, yeah, you got to deal with this, too.

Dumped by two women in the same day, Schmidt, that has got to be a record, man.

I get it, all right? I lost two perfect women, but I'm fine with it, all right? I'm fine.

You could've been perfectly happy with either one of them, - but now you're by yourself.

Winston, I'm fine.

Please.

That really has to hurt.

This is my home, too.

I shouldn't have to be faced with their stupid, happy relationship everywhere I look.

This is going to stop, Winston, and I'm gonna stop it.

Well, my advice to you is to stay in your foxhole, keep your head down and invest in one of these babies.

Watch your butt, Furguson.

This is my survival kit.

Check this out, man.

Blindfold.

Get this bell wrapped around my neck so he can hear when I'm coming.

Every couple has a weakness.

Kate and Will, I could break them up with one e-mail.

Oh, look at that, look at the royal baby now, - living with slutty Aunt Pippa.

I'm telling you, they're bulletproof.

Um, I have to show Nick something in the bathroom.

Yeah, it's tiles.

I'm so bad at lying.

It's for sex.

Oh, go! Go make love in our communal shower.

Enjoy it now, you little bunnies.

What? Want to see a magic trick? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess I like your chewing face.

It's just food.

Yeah, that's all it is, okay, people? I know it's super annoying to be around a couple.

Not me at all.

It's him.

Who? Oh.

Look at him.

Yeah, we had a tough day today at the V-E-T.

Yeah, they said he's gonna have to get It rhymes with "fleutered.

" The word is neutered.

Cats don't speak English.

Furguson's never gonna experience actual, physical lovemaking.

Do you think you're a little too into your cat? He should be out there, just getting all crazy, getting his freak on.

I feel bad, man.

I don't know what to do.

Let's try to help.

We got three smart people here.

We all know we got to get Furguson laid, right? Cat bachelor party.

That's right.

What do you think? Yeah, get some little cat strippers.

Big booty cats, little booty cats.

Some tabbies.

Some black ones, some white ones.

Yeah.

We'll mix it up.

Get us a couple Siamese, get weird with it.

Get him laid? - You know we're kidding? Sure, sure, sure, sure.

Gotcha.

It's happening.

Oh, look, it's you and you.

Is that a cake? Why do you have a sheet cake? Don't eat the cake, Jess.

What is that? Like, vanilla and vanilla? I just wanted to wish you guys a happy one-month anniversary.

Hip hip.

You said you wanted to break us up.

You said you didn't care if it took your whole life.

Look, I understand that I'm not exactly your favorite person right now, but I didn't want a milestone in your relationship like this to-to go uncelebrated.

You're really great together.

I don't trust him.

I know.

It's Schmidt we're talking about.

After he saw the movie Titanic, he started the Billy Zane fan club.

What? - Look it up.

They're called the Zaniacs.

Why does that make me angrier than anything he's ever done? - I will handle this.

Okay.

And I'm gonna test this cake because I'm so mad at Schmidt.

Hey, dummy, why'd you get us that cake? Come on, man, I'm just happy for you.

Looking at a-a month? A big month, man.

How many relationships have you had that have lasted more than a month? I don't know, some.

Probably very few, probably very, very few, right? I mean, you think it's less than two? One, it's Caroline, you know.

One? Are you kidding me, man? It's insane.

That's so few, but I guess you only need one, right, the one.

Too soon? - I'm really happy, Schmidt.

You should be, man.

Look at you.

You're like a different guy.

Usually at this point, you're overthinking and anxious and panicky and overthinking and overthinking and distant and nervous and sweaty and overthinking.

You're trying to get in my head, and it's not gonna work.

Who could, man? Look at you.

You're cool as a cucumber.

You're Obama on the ski slopes.

Now, get out there.

Enjoy that cake with the woman that you love.

Too soon? Forget about it.

Good talk.

Yeah.

What's wrong? Nothing.

Uh-oh.

Looks like we have a little Groundhog Day situation.

Please don't call it a Groundhog's Day situation.

Six more weeks of winter.

Don't worry.

Lie back.

I'm gonna take care of this.

This has never happened in my whole life, just so you know.

It's cool.

What can I do to help? I don't know, maybe think outside of the box? A little chicken kabob with rice.

Choice of naan or chutney.

How about we - Shh! Oh, I had it.

Reverse psychology.

I'm not attracted to you.

I don't think you're sexy.

Don't want to have sex with you.

Okay.

I think you're a fat, fat, fatty, fat - Okay! Oh, yeah.

Papa Smurf? Really? Whole body.

Are you sure? - Yes, hey.

Okay.

This will work, let's do it.

Okay.

Okay.

Well, at least the sun managed to get up.

I have to go move my car.

I'm kidding.

But I'm kidding! Are we not kidding about this? Does she have all her sh*ts? - Yep.

Okay, cool, cool.

Um, let me ask you this.

Uh, does she strike you as, um, I don't know, slutty? Excuse me, I'm here to pick up Fatty from her grooming.

Oh.

Oh, there you are.

Who are you here to pick up? - Well, actually, uh, my boy cat is looking for a girl cat.

Oh.

Well, I might know a girl cat who's looking for a boy cat.

Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.

Does the girl cat have all her parts? - Um, yeah.

Yes? Uh, okay.

Well, um, I don't know, maybe, uh, she could come over sometime? Like, our cats could go on a date? Yes, you get it.

You know, everyone else thought I was being weird.

So, um, how often do you groom your cat? So I talked to my mom about it, - and my dad - I've got to go move my car.

Hey, no, it's important we talk about these things.

Nick, it's - I'm moving my car! Hello.

Whew, Nick looks exhausted.

You guys obviously had a good night.

Yeah, um, I We didn't sleep much.

Well, of course you didn't, you mangy little stray.

I really don't want to talk about it, - especially not with you, Schmidt.

I know, and look, I also realize that it's gonna be a long time for me to regain your trust.

I just think it's sad because if you did have a Nick problem, I probably could help you out.

You know, my diploma says that I majored in communications, but my heart says that I majored in Nicholas studies.

I'm just saying.

I love the morning.

Anything's possible.

The whole day's ahead of you, you know? Last night, Nick struggled with impotence.

Oh, my God, I'm not talking you about this.

Jess, look, I get it.

You don't want my help, but just do me a favor please.

Let me know when you're not mad at me anymore so I can tell you about how men crave danger and variety in their sexual lives.

I just hope it's not too late, fingers crossed.

What are you talking about? I mean, I don't care, but if I did theoretically.

Theoretically, I would tell you for-for a man whose midsection is basically mush, Nick has had a lot of sex.

He's pushed that mush all over town.

And you know what, he's got some very weird taste.

Dark, real fringe stuff.

He likes stuff that they don't even have p*rn for.

And you know, a lot of women wouldn't think to do the Captain - in-in bed.

What? That was a mistake.

I shouldn't have said anything.

I didn't want to talk about the Captain.

It was a thing, and I did and Do you want a smoothie? What's the Captain? Well, it starts off with But you want to clean yourself up immediately.

I mean immediately.

And then you How comfortable are you with racial slurs? Then you That's basically it.

That's what Nick wants in bed? Yeah, I know.

Look, you're probably not up for it.

It's my It's my fault.

It's very degrading, it's offensive, and you, you just don't have the time to learn all those dolphin sounds.

Are you sure you don't want some of this smoothie? It's straw-bana.

Okay, Furguson, this is a big moment in your life.

All right, just be yourself, you dawg.

Winston, I think I found a way to You want to try some catnip? This is a real bummer.

Ahoy, Nicholas.

Wait, I'm scared! - Hey.

Hey.

I'm so glad you could make it.

Oh, thanks.

Let's, um, let's head to my room.

Oh, you're not wasting any time.

You know, it's just that I have very judgy roommates, you know, that might get a little weirded out if they walked in the room and saw something they weren't supposed to see.

Oh.

Or it's whatever, whatever Fatty wants.

What do you want, Fatty? Fatty wants to see your room.

That's awesome.

Great news.

You hear that, Furguson? - Y'all go play.

Yeah? There you go.

He was nervous.

Well, good thing I brought this.

Yeah, we can't give wine to these cats.

It's been a tough six months, and this cat needs a drink so O-Okay.

I don't think they care.

They're not listening at all.

Mm-mm.

They're too into each other.

Yeah.

Nick, we have to talk about this, okay? All right, I'll go first.

Listen I was uncomfortable with some of the specifics of what we just did.

For example, when I said, "You like that, huh?" I felt like you really, really didn't like it.

How do you feel? I just I feel like, you know No, it's just kind of like be I mean Uh It was good, you know.

It's over.

Love sleeping birdsty.

I just want to know what I did wrong.

How does the Captain normally go?

The what?

The Captain.

What we just did.

I've never done that in my life.

We did that because you wanted to, Jess.

What?! Why would I want to do that? That's degrading to not only women but all of mankind, Nick.

I know.

I only did that 'cause Schmidt told me it was your favorite thing Did you say, 'cause Schmidt said? No, no, no, no.

Did you just Did you talk to tight pants and eyebrows Who was I supposed to talk to, Nick? Every time I tried to talk to you about your penis problems, you went to move your car.

Those aren't penis problems.

What is Did you talk to Winston about my penis problems? - What about Cece, did she get a call? - He wasn't around.

Schmidt told me he had a PhD in Nickology.

He doesn't.

There's no such We have to talk about our feelings 'cause we're together.

If we needed to talk about feelings, they would be called "talkings."


No, that is not true.

Nick - That is 100% - This is it This is Schmidt getting in our heads.

I'm going to k*ll him! - Jessica, wait.

Schmidt! I can't run that fast The Captain! I trusted you.

You took advantage of me.

Something wrong? - You set us up.

I've done things to Nick I can't ever undo.

You see, your fatal flaw Communication.

You won't shut up about your feelings, and the only thing this dummy wants to talk about is the Chicago Brown Bears.

It's just the Chicago Bears.

There's no brown Who cares? I put a pebble in your path and the two of you cracked your tiny little skulls on it.

Ooh, by the way, how was the Captain? Did you make it all the way to the spyglass? Yes, Schmidt! And my night vision's very good 'cause my eyes are so buggy and big and I saw everything and I can't erase it from my memory.

Please, Jess, stop talking about the Captain.

Why don't we just go back to being roommates.

Okay? Nick, what do you say? The floor is yours.

You want to tell us how you feel? - Me? - Yeah.

Well I think it's I just Beautifully said.

Thank you, Nick.

Enjoy your breakup.

If you need me, I'll be in my room listening to mainstream hip-hop.

Stop! I have feelings.

I didn't like when you did the Captain.

It made me feel bad.

Okay, I've I've never seen this sober before.

Stop, it's my turn.

You talk too much and it frustrates me.

Sometimes you talk even after you've fallen asleep.

How do you breathe? Where do you get the words? But it doesn't matter, Jess, because I like you a lot.

But maybe do that less, okay? Nick, I just feel Sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Just keep going.

I don't know.

Um I really like the instrument of the cello.

I like the cell a lot, and I don't talk about it a lot but I should because I feel very passionate about it.

It's a beautiful instrument.

It's like a guitar but it stands up.

I once saw a zebra named Gavin give birth at the zoo, and I cried hysterically.

And then I bought one of those stretched out pennies that you can get to remember it and then I lost that and I cried again.

Sometimes when I smell dust in like an attic or something, like that mothy, dusty, I think about my mother.

When I was 14, I saw my mother change, and I saw her whole body naked without underpants on.

I really like when a rap song uses a choir.

It makes me feel really happy when all those ladies' voices come in and then the guy's rapping.

I think it's awesome.

I'm really proud of you, Nick.

I really like.

I like you, too.

And it's been a month and I'm not scared.

Unless you're doing the Captain, and then I experience very real fear and it's very visceral Just kiss me.

No kissing in the living room! No.

No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Cease lovemaking! All lovemaking must cease.

Get out of here, Schmidt! - Break up! - Just break up already, pl - Oh, forget it.

I'm just I'm-I'm - Hey, no, no.

What are you doing? Oh, my God, he just h*t my sack.

Body block! I'm pure core.

I've been training for this.

Yeah, human dental dam.

So What do you do for fun? Huh? Oh, um You know, like all good things.

Like what? Tell me one thing.

I'm sorry, do you hear noise? - Oh - Do you hear shouting? - 'Cause I'm just - Yeah.

No.

No, no, no, no, no.

Who the hell mess up the mood?! - Schmidt, Schmidt.

Hey.

Put down my condoms.

Pull it together, Schmidt.

It's raining celibacy.

Hallelujah.

You're losing it, man.

If I'm not having sex in this loft, nobody's having sex in this loft.

Hyah! Oh, hey, hey.

Hey, hey.

Oh, my birth control pills.

You don't want to do this, my man.

Yes, I do want to do this.

It's the only way to get this place back to the way that it was.

Put them down.

Give them to me.

Give them to Jess.

Come on, buddy, it's not worth it.

No fear! - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

Oh, my God.

Why didn't you just throw them in the sink, you idiot.

You better pray that was a placebo week.

Is he eating birth control pills? Friday! Full wheel, bitches! I win.

I don't feel good.

Guys, come on, our cats were just about to have sex.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, this whole time I thought What? Fatty, come on.

We're out of here.

So, what do you guys think, loft meeting in 20? Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

Got to stick my head in a paper bag and scream at the top of my lungs.

Oh, yeah, there'll be no snacks.

Schmidt, I just looked it up.

There's no way estrogen works that fast.

You don't know my body.

Please, stop talking about your body.

Okay, that's a good segue to some of the more relevant topics that I would like to cover in this meeting.

Like, uh, personal space.

Public space.

Other people's medicines Taking them versus not taking them.

I am so aware of my nipples right now.

Okay, that's a good start.

If someone were to blow on my nipples, I would positively scream.

Boundaries.

Any takers? All right, we live here.

Where are we supposed to go? This is my fault.

'Cause I'm going through a sexual awakening.

It's like I'm tapping into this raw sexual energy that the universe is putting forth.

And it's just both imploding and exploding at the same time.

And it's kind of like I'm a young nun.

And Nick is my sexy monseigneur.

And I'm a I'm just going to shut up.

Both of you need to shut up, okay? You're having sex, not inventing.

It can't be that good.

It's good.

Stop saying, "Squeeze my biscuits.

" - I'm serious, Nick.

Sorry.

And, Schmidt, stop taking it out on everybody else, man.

Deal with your breakups.

Ain't no way in hell I got a cat brothel going on in my room and I'm the only normal person in this loft.

You did a bad thing.

Deal with it.

What's that? Oh, it's just what I needed.

This gum is crap.

You ready? What is it? Just keep your eyes closed.

All right, stand right there, okay? - Okay.

Turn around.

I love it.

Yeah.

I don't I don't know what it is.

All right, then yell something.

I soundproofed it.

What's wrong? I just heard yelling.

Get out of here, man.

He must He must've literally been right by the door.

It is soundproofed That's what the egg crates are for, so Nick, I just want to say something.

Um This last month has been the best month of my life.

Me, too.

I've never, you know, felt this way or had this with anybody.

It's like there's been this fog around my life, and with you, all of a sudden it's gone.

I love that you can express your feelings now.

Yeah, it's a weird feeling.

It's kind of like gross but also good.

You know? It's like an egg broke.

And then, like, all the yolk comes out but it's good.

I'm happy to admit I like love songs.

I understand them.

They're really sad.

They're mostly about either the girl or the guy got away.

They're heartbreaking numbers.

The air Do you feel it? I guess this is the air you breathe, but it's nice.

I feel like I'm on this whole new planet.

How about your two favorite planets? Oh, yeah, those are great.

But I also feel like being with you, I've finally, for the first time, and I know this sounds crazy, but I can see the stars.

You know, the other great thing about talking about our feelings is we don't need to do it all the time.

Thank you for expressing that.

I feel like I can see you - Uh-huh.

in 3-D vision.

Everyone see in 3-D.

Hmm.

So, would you like to take my bra off, or should I? See, I feel excited to take your bra off.

So, do it.

I love your breasts.

Just mixing it up with those two things.

I'm not even nervous to do it.

So, do it.

I feel excited to Okay, right now.

Let's do this.

Hey, Elizabeth, what are we doing tonight? Dexter and pie.

Girl, you treat me right.

Hey, there she is, my one and only.

Oh, thank God, coffee.

I barely slept last night.

Yeah, me, too.

I think I passed out for, like, 25 minutes when you jammed that sock down my throat.

I aim to please.

Aw Hey, why don't we all go on a double date? What are you guys doing tonight? Yeah.

Tonight? - Yeah.

Today's tonight? - Yeah.

Tonight meaning changes every day, doesn't it? Come on, Schmidt.

I'm sure he's got other plans.

You've got other plans, right? Plans? Not me.

I don't even I mean Yeah! What the hell is going on? What? Double-double-double-double date! Rock, rock and roll.

I don't think I exactly understand the energy here, but yeah, I mean, it sounds great.

Hey, you want to split that pasta from last night, hmm? Winston and Furguson 'bout to split some pasta.

Yeah, man, you know I got "wuv" for you.

Got nothing but love for you.

Go ahead, chill out, man, I'll make you some coffee.

What? So what are y'all talking about, going on dates? Oh, y'all are talking about that.

Okay, cool.

Nobody invited me.

Is it 'cause I'm single? I mean, I I know I'm single.

I'm okay with it.

It was a choice that I made as a man to be alone.

Don't nobody know you like you, so I'm I'm choosing to know myself, who I am.

And if that's okay with you all, can I come? All right, where should we go tonight, you guys? What about that new spot Picca? A day-of rezzie at Picca? You guys don't think I can do it, huh? Well, funk that.

Bishop can get a table at a chair store.

Well, that's it, then.

Double date plus one! You know what would be nuts? If I brought my cat Furguson as a date.

Ah, don't do that.

Hey, listen.

What is that sound? Sounds like a gravel driveway in there.

Seventh grade.

Pumping my fist too hard at a Weird Al show.

Go away! Hey, Jess, can you talk? Oh.

Yeah, yeah, totally.

How'd I get so lucky? My bro and my ho.

My penis it's gonna be exposed.

It's okay, just cover up.

Okay, no, but I don't feel comfortable.

It's about Schmidt.

Okay, I'm not involved in this at all.

Hiding from the world.

You can't see me, I can't see you.

I know this sounds totally paranoid, but I think he's on drugs.

Schmidt on drugs? Okay, not getting involved starting now.

I'm with Nick here.

You remember how hard he took it when Lance got busted.

He just stared at that yellow bracelet and cried.

I know you're right, but - You're coming in? - It's just like he's had this crazy energy lately.

And did you see how insane he was when we were talking about the double date? Also, he has just, like, stopped blinking.

Is that whippits? - Well, Nick can talk to him.

No, I'm not gonna talk to him.

I called that I wasn't gonna be involved; those calls have to be respected.

If you talk to him, I'll give you a treat.

Bedroom treat or kitchen treat? Oh, I'm just a country lawyer and I have a very, very itchy bra.

Well, perhaps I can get underneath.

I've got worker's hands.

It's very itchy in so many different little places.

Let me see.

You guys are being really, really gross right now.

I keep forgetting you're in here.

I think you made a really good point.

Maybe he is just, like, really into me.

I mean, he has, like, stepped up his bed game a lot.

It is so not about him anymore.

That's disgusting.

Let me know when that treat's gonna happen.

And, Cece, I'm sorry about this, but I'm gonna stand up and you're gonna see my penis, and when I walk out, you're gonna see my butt.

Let's do this.

Oh.

Ah, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

Sorry.

Yeah, so that's glass.

That ain't no mint.

Nope.

Definitely glass, and I swallowed that, so you should consider, uh, a sign.

Do you have a reservation? - You know, it's funny that you would ask that because, you know, I tried to call, like, but, uh, I'm looking for a reservation for tonight around 8:00 p.

m.

Let's say, like, five people.

I have an 8:30.

Ah, kind of had our heart set on 8:00.

Seven weeks from now.

Wait, what, what? No, n-n-n-n-no.

Look, there's got to be something that you can do.

Well, you could try your luck at the community table.

Community hell, no.

Listen, um, sorry, you don't understand.

This has to be an official reservation.

No.

I'll tell you what, maybe this will change your mind.

"I owe you a hundred dollars.

" Oh, hell no.

No, that that was supposed to be a ten.

Whoa, you got there faster than I thought.

Hey, so this is weird and it's only gonna take a second of your time, but, uh and I probably already know the answer, but are you on drugs? I know the answer is no, so I'll just see you later, man.

Get in my room.

Don't want to be part of it! Did you cr*ck my e-mail password? How did you guess "Smithereens"? Are you really on drugs? Talk to me, Schmidt.

I'm in way over my head, Nick, I'm doing something terrible.

Well, what is it, man? You're going to get mad at me.

I'm your best friend.

Okay, I was there for you when you fell off the deck at Chester's graduation.

Oh, no.

And I'm here for you now.

There's nothing you could say that I'd get mad at.

O okay, um, I can do this.

Do you know how I broke up with Elizabeth so that I could start dating Cece again? Absolutely, and it was really hard for you.

Yeah, that actually never happened.

What do you mean? I'm still dating Elizabeth.

What do you mean? I'm dating both of them, and neither one of them knows it, and I feel terrible about it.

But Elizabeth is gone.

What do you mean? - She's not gone.

So you broke up with Cece - I didn't break up with either one of them.

What do you mean? You process this however you need to process it.

If you want to keep talking it out - Which one are you dating? - Both.

Are you dating Cece? - I'm dating Cece.

Are you dating Elizabeth? - Yes.

How do you do that? - They made me choose.

You have to choose.

You can't have both women.

What was I supposed to do? What, you think you can have a bunch of wives?! You got one wife! This is the way the world works! - Why?! - I don't know.

I feel terrible about this, I don't know what to do.

How could you do this with Jess's best friend? I don't know, I feel really badly about it! In your little brain, how do you see this ending? I see it ending badly.

I see it ending very, very badly.

But you know what? I just I want to thank you, though, just for being there for me and for listening to me.

No.

I'm not listening to you and I'm not there for you.

Because now we're in this together.

We're not in this together and I'm not listening and I'm not being there, so just stop telling me things! What would you like me to do with this information? Well, it really helped me to tell you.

You should tell somebody, get it off your chest.

I can't.

You know what I mean? - Like who? Well, certainly not Jess.

Don't ever tell Jess.

The one person you can't tell is Jess.

Hello, Picca? Yes, I need a table for five.

This is author Toni Morrison.

I am? Well, oh, yeah? Well, I think you're a woman! Hello? Okay, here's what it is.

Just lie to her, Nick.

It's a relationship men and women lie to each other all the time; it's what makes marriages work.

Just lie Oh, you can lie Yes, I talked to Schmidt.

Don't act like an alien; just lie to a woman.

It's Yeah, I talked to Schmidt.

It's fine, it's not a big deal.

Hey, Nick.

How was your day? Nothing Why are you wearing a helmet? Oh, hi.

Don't tease me, Nick.

Are we finally gonna do no-kiss sex? Oh, yes.

Sorry about that.

Look at us.

Community table, like a little community.

Call that seat.

That's my seat.

Come on.

Yeah.

Oh, no, where are y'all going? Dibs on those seats, dibs on that.

Put that for me right there.

Hey, put that right there for me.

That was amazing.

Jess, you know so many Spaceballs quotes.

They jam the radar with literal jam.

Oh, hey, did you ever talk to Schmidt? What's going on, Nick? Schmidt! Hey! My best friend?! You Long Island street trash! Damn it, Nick, you told her? No, he didn't tell me! I I happened upon it.

Oh, you happened upon it? Where, in the town square? Jess, I never wanted to be involved in this.

You're so pretty.

Put your freakin' visor down.

Now, you you're gonna tell Cece or I will, you you crumb bum! - Jess - You crumb bum.

Yes, well said.

You are a lowlife.

I I get it.

How could you do this to her? - Jess, I am so sorry.

I made up a dance so everyone will be happy.

Cece's gonna walk through that door any minute, and you have to tell her the truth.

Jess, please, this would wreck her.

I'm begging you.

I I know you don't believe me, but I do care about her.

Either you tell her or I will, Schmidt.

You're right.

I'll tell her.

Yo, what it be? Double date night! What's, uh, what's going on? Tell her.

Tell her.

Okay, okay.

We're taking two cars.

It's faster that way because of gas.

No phones.

What? Here you go; I got the door, it's okay.

Go! Go! Cigarette, phone call, bathroom.

Okay.

Sir, you're clearly alone.

We're gonna need this table.

Okay, so what do you think that over the past two hours, I, as a single person, have ordered eight separate entrees and have taken bites of different sizes of each of them to create some sort of pointless illusion? Do you know how insane you sound? God, I hate this job.

You need to slow down.

I got it.

Don't worry.

What's going on, man? You guys were acting all so weird back there, - and you're driving like a maniac.

Oh, geez.

You know, I didn't want to have to say anything, but What? Here we go.

Nick is cheating on Jess! Aah! - What?! Apparently, they met at some gas station.

She's much older.

Much, much older.

Deeply Korean.

I just found out.

And, I mean, Nick is my best friend and all, but I can't even be in the same room as that scumbag right now! Oh, I'm so mad! I'm just so, so mad! I'm terribly angry about the whole situation.

I can't even drive.

Take the wheel.

Oh, why, God?! He was the best of us! - Cece, please.

You're veering everywhere.

Sorry.

Oh, Nick, go, go! We're gonna lose them! You keep nerd-stopping at every sign! Look, if I get another ticket, they're gonna make me wear eyeglasses.

Why didn't you get involved back there? Look, look, here's the reality.

Yes, Schmidt is my best friend, and he's also really scary.

You are so afraid of everything.

Oh, really? Would a man afraid of everything - put his finger in a cigarette lighter? - I don't know Don't do that.

That's just stupid! - I'm not gonna do that.

You wimp.


Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! - Jess, are you okay? - It really hurts.

Oh, my Lord, are - It's so hot! - Come here.

Are you okay? - Yeah.

Are you okay? Look, I'm gonna do it.

Ow! Oh.

Why did you do that? So that we were both in the same amount of pain! I'm gonna junk-punch him.

Turn the car around.

We're going to the restaurant.

Why would you ? That seems rash.

Maybe I don't know.

Maybe staying away for a while, or at least I don't know talking about it, hearing his side.

I don't Cheating is selfish, and it is cowardly, and there is no excuse for it.

The only thing that you can do is punch it in the junk.

Or you could really understand it emotionally from their point of view.

You don't know.

Maybe they had a tough childhood.

Turn the car around, Schmidt.

Maybe their mom's a lesbian.

I don't know.

Turn the car around! Yeah, let's do it.

Let's turn the car around.

Let's go to Picca.

I'm gonna turn the car around as soon as I turn this Turn the car around Schmidt! - As soon as I turn the car around.

Now! As soon as I turn this car around Turn the car around, Schmidt! Let's go! And I'm turning the car around.

Let's do it.

Here we come.

What is he doing? - I don't know.

Looks like he lost a wing.

Hey, Jess.

Yeah, fourth message.

Just a friendly time update.

guys aren't bailing on me, or maybe you just lost track of time being couples! h*t me back.

Winnie the Bish.

We're never gonna find this restaurant; maybe we should just go home.

There it is! - Here it is.

Welcome! - Can I have your car, sir? - Oh.

Sir? Sir? Sir? I'm on the phone.

All right, time's up.

You got to get out of here.

Uh, th that's my friend.

That's my friend.

See? See? I told you all.

Huh? I got friends.

Everybody? Hmm? That's my friend right there.

Where the hell is Nick?! How did I even b*at him here?! - That was the slowest ride of my entire life! - Oh, Jess Literally, my grandmother drives faster than that.

Look, she's my best friend.

Yeah.

And Schmidt is mine.

That's why I didn't want to get involved.

Well, when someone I love gets hurt, I get involved.

Sir? What's up, big cat? Sir? Sir? Well, you got to go in there, and you got to face her.

Look, it's not about Cece.

This is about the $12 valet.

It's $12 to ? One sec.

Hey, it's self-park! The maroon car is self-park! It's an excessive amount of money.

I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

Look, I know you didn't, okay? But now it's time you do the right thing, Schmidt.

I can't go in there.

Well, I can't let Jess tell her.

Hello? Open the door.

Wait, Cece! - Oh, Jess, I have something to tell you.

I have something to tell you! What? No, I have something I need to tell you.

Oh, my God, what are you doing, Cece?! Why did you do that?! Cece.

You nipped the corner! Wait, Cece.

Uh okay.

I Cece, he's not I lied to you.

I I've been cheating on on you with Elizabeth.

Uh, I hate to do this right now, but if we don't sit, we will lose this table.

Cece, I'm sor I'm sorry.

I don't I just Is there someplace maybe we could, uh, go talk? Everybody knows anyway, Schmidt.

Might as well just say it.

Oh, let's talk.

Let's we this should be fine.

I didn't want to hurt you.

You have to know that I did not want to hurt you.

Please, I I'm begging you.

If you take anything away from this, know that I did not want to hurt you.

I didn't want to hurt anyone.

Especially you.

You have no idea what you mean to me.

And I got caught up in this thing, and I used to be so fat.

I mean, like truly gigantic.

I mean, as big as as big as big as it gets.

And now and now I'm not, and girls like me, and I don't I don't know how to do this.

I got lost.

And I'm sorry.

You're sorry? You didn't want to hurt anybody? That's the best you can do, Schmidt? Really? I don't know.

I don't know you.

Good-bye, Schmidt.

I'm just realizing that I don't have any cash on me.

If anyone would be willing to loan me $12 for the valet, that would be greatly appreciated.

Cece still hasn't called me.

Do you think you could test my phone again? I can't.

I don't have any more minutes.

Minutes, Nick?! Who still has minutes on their phone?! I bought 10,000 minutes in I'm sorry.

I just I I really want to be there for her.

You are, okay? And she'll call, 'cause she needs you.

Hell.

This is a real butt munch of a situation we're in.

Yeah.

Look I'm here for you.

There is nothing I know more than the fact that I want to be with you, Jess, okay? Unless we're driving.

You admitted to driving while legally blind! No, because you're honestly the worst backseat You're honestly telling me what to do the entire time! - Legally blind.

Whoever has the wheel controls the car! You liar! Here's your pie! You broke my heart.

Mail me my mouth guard.

In case you were wondering if Cece had Elizabeth's number, sh she does.

So, tough time in Schmidtsburg, wouldn't you say? Just a quick heads-up, Nick, Jess.

I blame you for this whole thing.

You can't seriously - I was going to fix it.

I wasn't going to hurt anyone.

But, since you took it upon yourself to hurt both of them, should it take me the rest of my life, I'm going to break the two of you up.

Bring it, Schmidt.

It's impossible.

We're really strong.

It will be when you least expect it, which might be when you most expect it.

Could actually be when you're watching the movie version of What to Expect When You're Expecting.

Regardless I am coming for you.

Oh, my God, Schmidt is so scary.

You were right.

We have to talk about the things - that he could use to pull us apart, okay? - Okay.

Okay.

Okay, politics.

You're a Democrat, I've never voted.

I'm in the Green Party.

Oh, that is so annoying.

Okay, I have been banned for my lifetime from Lake Ontario.

Don't ask.

Okay.

What else do you have? - My fear of pears.

Okay, you're afraid of pears? And pear-shaped people.

Um, that's interesting.

I'm not convinced I know how to read.

I've just memorized a lot of words.

The doctors say I might grow another 18 inches.

That's a different image of you, but I'm gonna get past that, and I'm past it.

Okay, the moon landing - Uh, which is obviously fake.

No, it's not obviously fake.

No, that's actually not what - Are you crazy? The moon landing is definitely fake, by the way.

The moon landing's not - What?! The shadows are off.

No, they're not.

Yes, they are.

I've looked at photos on the Internet, and it proves it.

Nick, that's - The shadows are off, the shadows are off ! Shadows are not those photos are Photoshopped.

That's not true.

People do that as a joke - to trick stupid people.

Oh, yeah, you can just Photoshop - No, that's - Wait a minute.

He's doing it already.

He's getting in our heads.

Unbelievable.

Good call.

Okay, this is good.

Let's keep going.

I totally agree.

Okay.

Let's keep going.

Okay.

I kind of want to get a g*n.

I'm definitely sexually attracted to Lady Bucks.

Ok.

I prefer the ***.

I think it's the best one.

I know that you're very into it - It's not.

Yes, it is.

He's very charming.

I'm weirdly good at volleyball.

I believe horses are from outer space.

I believe that too! - Ok.

Good.

Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess You know what? I've never actually seen you this happy.

Who are you? - I don't know, it's weird.

I've never seen you smile.

Ever.

This is the first time.

It's not bad.

I mean, it's not great.

Yeah, I agree.

Somewhere right in the middle.

Hey, can I ask you something? - Of course.

Hypothetically speaking, what if you met somebody that you that you liked, uh, just as much as Jess? Schmidt, stop.

Okay, you picked Cece, so let Elizabeth go.

Initially I said "hypothetically," so just Do you know a place I can get cheap school supplies? I only have $15 and a halfie $15 and a halfie.

A halfie? - Yeah, it's a half.

It got ripped, so it's a half.

No one's gonna accept that as currency.

Hey, what's up, guys? - Did you press the button? - I thought you pressed the button! What is wrong with you?! - What did you do when you walked in? - Talked to you.

Guys, I'm gonna go pick up Daisy's cat.

You know, you don't just ask anybody to take care of your cat.

That's a very serious thing, so I decided I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna ask Daisy to be my girlfriend.

You are? - Whoa! - Yeah.

Major move! - Good stuff.

Look at you, man.

So I'm just gonna go over there and I'm gonna tell Daisy, "Listen, my heart is a two-man bike, and I want you in the rear.

" What do you think? Winston, don't say that.

You want her in your? You can say "the rear.

" You don't want her in your rear.

No, don't say "the rear" at any time.

You guys are just jealous.

What? You guys are gonna steal my swag.

I wouldn't even know how to begin to steal a swag.

I thought you pressed the button.

I've been way over here.

I-I haven't pressed - I'll press the button.

Last night, I rectified our budget while taking a long soak in my new Jacooz.

My elbows are as soft as babies.

I love a soft elbow.

How about you bring that noise over here.

Good meeting.

Great, well Uh - Foster's such a dork.

He needs to get laid.

I got laid.

This morning.

From my boyfriend.

So coitus no-one-interruptus.

That because we finished, so Why are you talking to us? - You have owl eyes.

Yeah.

Hey! Trust me.

What's up, teachers? Who wants free school supplies? - What are you doing here? - Point to the ones who don't like you - I can handle this myself.

I'm fixing it for you.

And then she Yeah.

Say, listen, why don't you guys come to my bar later for free drinks.

Teachers don't pay.

We'll think about it.

Okay, they'll think about it.

Bye.

Oh, my God.

That was genius.

It's a no-brainer.

Whoa, that's an amazing move, sex partner.

Sex part With the promotion, uh, I got a new office, so I don't have to look at Bethany's mismanaged eyebrows all day.

Do you like it? It's a perfect two-thirds replica of Don Draper's office from Mad Men, and you're my sexy Peggy.

Good God, at least shut the door.

My tiny credenza is in the way.

Hey, Elizabeth, are you gonna be coming to the party tomorrow night? Party? What party? The big office party.

Schmidt, did you not invite her? I was just about to invite you to go.

Cool, it's a date.

Bye, baby.

Bye.

Mwah, mwah.

How how dare you interfere with my personal life, you crone.

I don't I don't kick up a fuss when you massage yourself with your yoga ball.

Oh, I'm sorry, were you gonna invite Cece? Beth, please.

I am in love with both of these women.

Do I feel bad about lying to them? Yes.

I'm a Sagittarius.

Congrats on your new office.

Gina gave birth on that carpet.

Consider this closed.

Right, so, yeah, um Um, so, Daisy, what I was really trying to say is, uh Is your shower running? Yeah, I was just about to take a shower.

What's going on? - Okay.

Um, Daisy, I think what we have is real, and, uh, I want us to be exclusive just you and me in the rear.

Yeah, that sounds great.

Awesome, um Sorry, that's mine.

So, Furguson gets his wet food in the morning, dry food at night.

Somebody in there? No.

No treats after midnight.

"Oh, my name is Principal Foster, and this is the Jacooz.

" "The Jacooz.

" He's so nice, don't you think? He's such a nice boss.

Y'all want some drinks? - Yeah, okay.

Yep.

Yeah.

Thank, thank you.

Thank you.

What do you think? I think it's going really well.

Okay, I just realized what's happening.

It's high school over there, and they're the cool kids, and you're the nerd.

I was never a nerd.

On western wings the fowls doth fly On briny swells the fishes doth swim Oh, like you were so cool.

Stall! CROWD Nick! Nick! Nick! The Miller Sack Pack.

Miller Sack Pack? - They made shirts.

You know what? I'm not explaining my coolness to you.

I was cool.

Listen to me.

You want to be in with them? Roll with the punches, go with the flow.

Make fun of your boss a little bit.

Don't follow your instincts.

I wouldn't sing.

But most importantly, follow my lead.

And by "follow my lead," I mean drink.

And I mean drink a lot.

Drinking to be cool, Nick? That's not a real thing.

That's the only thing in the world I know to be true.

Schools are for fools! They are.

Sometimes firemen are women! Sometimes! Sometimes! Hey, there she is.

Ol' Toilet Pants, the girl who bet herself six dollars she could dance in a toilet bowl.

Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah What's going on? I'm cool.

You are cool, but you still got to go to work, 'cause you're running late, so up and at 'em.

Hey, Nick, I got to talk to you.

I have a real problem.

Oh, my God.

Did you k*ll Jess? - No, no, no, no.

She just got really drunk last night, and she passed out.

Hey, guys.

Are you crying, buddy? - No.

Hey, did he k*ll Jess? No, I didn't k*ll Je Okay, remember when I was so hungover, I almost missed my flight for Christmas? Ah, count it down.

Three, two, one.

Two, one.

I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar Soar - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

Oh, she's awake.

That was beautiful.

Where are my tights? Uh, in the bathroom where you barfed.

You sounded really good there, man.

Start the band.

What did you do to her? I just told her that I thought drinking would make her cool.

What are you, a 14-year-old hockey player? You're supposed to protect her, not encourage her.

Okay, I am protecting her.

She's my old lady now.

By turning her into you? - I'm not Yeah, Daisy cheating on me.

Wait, we're using real honey? So sticky.

Hey, babe! What a nice surprise! I came to tell you that you can't come with me to the party tonight.

They just told me that it's employees only.

No sig oths.

Just say "significant others.

" Maybe you have that kind of time, but I'm on a tight sched.

Looks like we're gonna go late here anyway, so no worries.

All right Shorty.

All right, bring in the bees! Oh, wait.

The bees are real, too? Oh, hell no! Nick, I need your help, okay? Now, I am no plumber, but I'm 99% sure that there was a guy in her bathroom.

So, she agreed to be exclusive with you while the guy she is obviously sleeping with was washing his size 15 ding-dong in the shower.

And now you're taking care of her cat.

Those are the b*llet points, yes.

You know what you got to do to get yourself out of this situation.

Break up with Daisy! Yeah.

Yeah, I mean, you're making some very good points.

You know, break up with Daisy.

That's an option.

I was thinking, like, I'll k*ll her cat.

Winston.

Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna k*ll her cat first.

Hey.

I'm gonna k*ll you.

Hey, it's little Toilet Pants.

Hey, Toilet Pants! Toilet Pants! Please stop shouting.

You are so awesome.

I want to show you something.

Oh! Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

You're one of us now.

You never have to drink out of a paper cup again.

Fun mugs.

This one makes me look like I have a - mustache.

Mustache.

Mustache.


What's up, Winston?

Oh, hey, Nick.

You know, I couldn't figure out the best way to k*ll Furguson, so I decided to just let him choose how he wants to die.

If only I could get him to leave that damn sunbeam.

You're gonna m*rder a cat? - Yeah.

This is a joke, right? - No.

This is one of your pranks? - An eye for an eye, Nick.

A cat for a cat.

But what's the other cat? My heart.

Where's that big flashlight you can h*t people with? Also, do we have any meat pieces that might distract a dog? Winston, don't do anything stupid.

Jess, what are you doing? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

Cool, cool.

It's nothing.

We're just breaking into Foster's backyard, and we are gonna put our butts in his Jacuzzi.

You're gonna put your butts in his Jacuzzi? - Isn't it awesome? - Uh, no, it's not awesome.

It's a crime.

It's a very stupid crime, but it's a crime.

Hey, do you have any makeup or costumes that might make someone look like a bush? You are about to commit a felony.

Oh, my God, Nick! You said roll with it! You're not the kind of person who could break into the principal's house and get away with it.

You're the kind of person who gets caught, and it ends up on the Internet in a funny way.

My God! That is the cutest cat! Uh, don't get attached.

Okay, both of you, knock it off! Winston! Look, Nick, you're right.

I'm a nerd.

I've never fit in.

If I met you in high school, you never would have even noticed me.

That's just because I didn't go to class.

I wouldn't have seen you.

I know it's stupid, but I'm doing it.

I'm not letting you go.

Oh, you're not letting me? No.

If for some reason I don't come back tonight, I'll be at the Appleton Suites under the name Suzuki Sinclair.

Ask for Charles.

Don't Hey, hey.

We're not done with this conversation, young lady! - Well, we are done! - Oh, yeah, then where are you going?! - I'm getting a flashlight! - Oh, a hammer, huh? - Hey, Winston, Winston.

Good way to go.

Thr - Don't hurt that cat.

Uh-huh.

Hey, Furguson? Furguson? - You scared him.

Don't do this.

Furguson? - Winston! Winston, Winston, stop what you Stop! Don't do that scary walk! Do not do that scary walk that you do that scares me! Hey, Jess? Jess? Je? Winston, don't k*ll that! Jess! I don't know what to do! - Oh, good Lord.

What's wrong? Nothing.

You know what? Let me show you the stairwell where they got the idea for the escalator.

Shorty! My love.

My only love.

I'm sorry.

I just I quit that job, and I had to see you.

How emotional.

Let's go talk about it in private in a perfect two-thirds replica of Don Draper's office.

You stay here.

I'm gonna get you a drink.

No, no, no, please, you-you you stay here.

So - Oh, God, what? They're both here.

The gas has been spilled.

All we need is a match.

What, are you narrating a book? Here it comes.

The long nap.

Oh, wow.

Tell you what, man, we both need to just cool off and have a drink.

You smoke? I'm just kidding.

But, man, that'd be cute if you did.

What is wrong with me? It Oh, Furguson.

So, listen, I've been dreaming about this fantasy, and I think this party might be the perfect place to try it out.

Okay, but I can't get wet.

No water.

So, listen, you and I are gonna be sexy strangers.

Yeah? Now, your stranger is the early-to-bed type, and your job has you on Hong Kong time.

But the most important thing is, you're the first person to leave the party.

Whew.

I like.

Wait, is that Cece? - Is that who? Huh? No.

Cece.

No.

No, Schmidt, that's definitely Cece.

Sorry, in between modeling jobs, she does catering.

You mind if I go over there and say hello? I think it's only right.

Eh.

Hey.

Hey, I know you told me to stay in the office, but Beth insisted that I Stay away from that woman.

She is patient zero in this office for spreading HPV.

Here.

Put on this apron.

No, why-why would I do that? That's crazy.

My boss was asking, so I told her you were a caterer.

So just It's a good idea.

Okay.

Just Yes.

You really want me here, don't you? So badly.

Can we just come back when we have a plan? Are you afraid? No, I'm not afraid.

Rose, give me a boost.

Here's Rose.

I got you.

Oh, my Oh, my God.

You got to help me a little.

That's a hell of a grip, Rose.

I see the Jacuzzi! Didn't stick the landing! You're doing great.

I'm gonna do a loop to not attract suspicion.

All right.

All right.

Schmidt.

I'm right here.

Oh.

Do I know you? Right.

The fantasy.

Boy, I got to go.

I have a 5:00 a.

m.

conference call with the Asians.

Are you leaving soon, stranger? You mean "Corporal"? And, no, I'm gonna stick around and throw down one more beer.

Sweet.

Oh, hey.

Don't tell me you're leaving.

Whew, great news.

My boss is in her office completely passed out.

We finally have the night to ourselves.

Thank God.

It's getting a little weird here, right? Dressed up like this.

That Elizabeth? Okay, look, Cece, I-I got to tell you something.

Does Elizabeth work here? Yes.

Hey.

We were just talking about you.

The food was good.

Yeah.

I was thinking of taking some home.

You deserve it.

Okay, well, I'm heading off.

The Asian markets wait for no one.

Wow.

She was ice cold to you.

I'm gonna go get a drink.

What a night.

I got this! - Open the damn gate! - Everything's under control! - Jess, hey! Don't move! I'm coming over! Rose, move! Jess, hey.

I'm coming.

I got you.

Whoa, hey, Rose! Ease up on the throttle.

Those are my precious goods.

Did you follow me here? Here I come! - Nick.

Hey.

Hey, Jess.

Jess, hey.

You okay? - Yeah.

I'm sorry I tried to stick my nose in this.

I just I just I came here because I'm your old man now.

And if you're gonna do something that's obviously very stupid then I'm gonna do it with you.

Oh.

Oh, my God.

You go there.

Ow.

What's going on out here? - Hey.

Who are you? - No, I-I used to live here.

I was just doing a visit around the neighborhood.

That's my old bedroom right there.

That's a bathroom.

To you maybe it is.

But to me and my four brothers, - that's a home.

Nick.

Nick, I can't let you do this.

Mostly 'cause you're so bad at it.

Is that you, Ms.

Day? - Yes.

It is.

I'm so sorry.

I trespassed on your property.

And I would not be surprised if you fired me.

I think I know what's really going on here.

You heard about my new Jacooz.

And you wanted a taste.

And say a little prayer for right You know that if we are to stay alive Come on in, kids.

The water's hot! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo Hey, babe.

Thanks for watching him.

He can be a real pain in the ass, huh? Yeah Was there a dude in your shower yesterday? Yes.

Hmm.

How do you know him? From sex.

But it was from sex before you and I were exclusive.

Have you had sex with him since? No.

Oh, wait.

Yes.

Last night.

Look, um I really liked you, Daisy.

You know, I wanted this to be a thing, but, uh I deserve better.

And so does Furguson.

Hmm? I'm keeping the cat.

I got your cat! Well, Schmidt, you win.

They both really love you.

So enjoy your office.

Hey! Toilet Pants! - Oh! Toilet Pants! Thanks for taking the b*llet for us the other night.

How long were you stuck in that Jacuzzi for? I don't really want to talk about it, but, um, at one point, he did grab my foot with his toes like it was a hand.

What are you doing tonight? 'Cause we got a liquid form of Ecstasy, and we're gonna grade papers together.

What? I would love to, but I actually think I'm gonna hang out with my old man.

That's weird.

Cool.

See you.

Weirdo.

Hi.

So I hear you're interested in joining the Sack Pack.

I might be.

Then perhaps this will wet your whistle of what's fun about being a member.

Just leave it.

Yeah.

You are terrible at Hacky Sack.

I think I'm retiring.

Yeah, I just want to say I would've noticed you.

Want to go do it in the teachers' lounge? - Yes.

You do? Oh, I'm gonna do it with a teacher! Shh.

Okay, something is definitely coming out.

I think we should go.

Previously on New Girl We're at a wedding together.

Guys, guys, shut and listen to me it's Cece.

She doesn't want to get married.

I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.

What I want is to be with someone else.

Are you in love with her or are you in love with me? You have to decide.

We tried.

We had one night.

Okay, what happened with Jess? We called it.

Yeah, when things get messy you just run away.

I know you think we should call it.

But I don't want to give up on this.

You know what? I gotta say, Jess, I really like you.

I really, really like you.

I really like you.

I can't believe this is happening.

It's crazy, but it's happening.

It's crazy.

I like you so much.

Yeah, I like you so much.

Like - Yeah.

I'm just - What? - I'm in.

You know? I'm - I'm just all in.

I'm all in.

I'm, like, weirdly all in.

Hey, Nick - What? Pull over.

Well, that was fun.

We finally broke in the Volvo.

Oh, my.

What's next? What do we do now? I'm really fighting the urge to buy you a lobster dinner.

Do we just go home? You know, I mean, just how is it actually gonna work? We've only been dating for 30 minutes and we're already living together.

What if you get tired of me, and you have nowhere to go because we're roommates, and so you have to sleep in your car Hey.

Stop.

That's not gonna happen.

I've wanted this for so long.

I don't want anything to go wrong.

Oh, it's Schmidt.

He's freaking out about Cece.

He doesn't need to reach you all the time.

You know what? You're right.

I'm gonna ignore it for now.

It's all about us right now.

Hmm.

It's Schmidt.

He wants to know where you are.

He texted you to ask where I am? That's ugh.

He just texted I'm a bad friend.

You know what that is? Either male genitalia, or a really big thumbs down.

Why would he send me male genitalia? - Why can't he talk to Winston? Well, without me, they get so weird and they fight all the time.

This is what I'm talk How many times a day does Schmidt text you? I don't know, I'll just say 40.

How See, this is what I'm talking about.

I feel like we need time alone so we can figure out what this is.

Yes.

This is what I want.

I want to be with you alone, without anybody else.

Just you and Where have you been? I'm having a major life crisis, and you guys are, what? Just driving around, French-kissing each other like a couple Dutch hookers? What is that, Nick? Is that a hickey? - Disgusting! - Hey, you guys.

Um, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

Now, I know everyone's going through a lot, but I think it is time for me to start a puzzle.

No, it isn't.

What is going on with you two? Are you, like, a couple now? Have you thought any of this through? Nick, please help me, okay? Stop being so selfish and just help me.

Okay, you know what? Give me one minute, - I'll be right inside.

We'll be right in.

Yeah, we just got to figure something out.

All right! Thanks, man.

The g*ng's back.

We'll be right in.

Yeah, good-bye, guys.

We love you guys.

Run! - Run! Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess Well, Winston, after 25 unanswered text messages to Nick and Jess this morning, I finally received a response.

A smiley face.

This leaves us with one choice - To become best friends.

Huh? Yeah, fine.

For r? Okay, great.

Now, as my best friend, I expect you to be willing to sacrifice everything for me at a moment's notice, including, of course, unfortunately for you, your dignity.

Yeah, fine.

Winston, what can I do for you? Don't talk to me that much, never lie to me, and never, ever touch my puzzle.

Winston, do we do we think now is really the right time to be starting a puzzle? I'm great at puzzles.

You're a born puzzler, Winston, sure, um, but don't you agree that sometimes, when you start puzzles, you get a little bit weird? And, I don't know, intense? Spend a lot of time humming.

Also spend a lot of time naked.

I'm gonna do you, puzzle! Right on the table.

As nasty as you want to be.

Hey, Schmidt, what do you think it's gonna look like? What do I think it's going to look like? - Yeah, the puzzle.

Winston, it's on the box.

The the picture's on the box.

It's a Japanese garden! Schmidt, calm down.

What is your problem? Two women are in love with me.

The problem is, is I'm in love with both of them.

Okay, looks like you're gonna have to choose.

Cece and I, we have this connection.

You know, it's physical it's unhealthy.

Look, I don't want to get too graphic with you, but I'm not just the plug with her.

I'm also a socket.

God okay, fine.

Schmidt, choose Cece.

Yeah, but - I was dating Elizabeth first, so - Mm-hmm.

Wait a minute Winston I was dating Elizabeth first.

You want to know what I think? - No, I don't.

Done.

Decided.

Ha! Cece, out.

I was dating Elizabeth first.

My man! Way to talk that out.

Yeah.

Best friends.

Best friends.

This is gonna work out, man.

Yeah, it's gonna work out, man.

Puzzling Winston is about to do some puzzling About to get into some puzzle troubling So, in conclusion, it's a you know, it's a very difficult decision that I've had to that, you know, that you guys have put me in, here, but I just I'm gonna be candid.

I've been up for 24 hours.

I have to return all of these gifts.

So just say it.

You don't want to be with me.

Wh huh? Look look at that.

I just looked down and I thought, "This girl must be wearing sneakers "with shoelaces, and th-those shoelaces must be tied together, because this girl is straight trippin', yo.

" - What? - Of course I want to be with you.

But I feel so terrible for Elizabeth.

How did she take it? Sh She took it.

In the marketplace of ideas, where culture is king, and data moves faster than people, where scalable opportunities come from turnkey solutions What are you trying to say, Schmidt? Is it over? No no.

As if.

Of course I picked you.

It wasn't even close.

Come here, you crazy white girl.

There it is.

Poor Cece.

Uh, yeah, okay.

Oh I fell asleep.

How long have you been driving? Those cops look like they're about 15 and they have huge g*n.

Jess, are we in Mexico? All in! We're in Mexico! Oh, my God, pull over! That piÃÂ±ata's shaped like a monkey! You know what? It's gonna be weird going back to having sex without a bunch of feral dogs watching.

Why am I not hungry? I should be hungry.

Remember when we lived in that loft, and, like, we had all those problems? Yeah.

All in! Voice mail? Again? Where have you been? It's been four days, man.

Have you really been doing it with Jess this whole time? That's disgusting.

Nick, I did something really wrong, and, uh I just I need to talk to you.

I need to talk to my friend.

Come home.

Yeah, I should try him again.

Dial best friend one.

Let's stay here.

We're totally out of money.

We got this great setup.

No, this is not gonna last long.

It's not gonna last long.

It isn't.

This is a badly built shelter.

We'll go right there.

How hard could that place be to sneak into? You all in? Nick, this has been fun, but Okay, look, everything that's bad is waiting for us back in the loft.

But here? I'm Paradise Nick.

And Paradise Nick is mega-chill.

And you're Paradise Jess, right? We can make food and just - All in.

All in.

It don't work like that.

If you uh Hey, man, how'd she take it? Devastated.

I'm sure glad that's settled.

Hey, man, I'm gonna go shower.

I'm proud of you.

I know it must have been tough.

Hey, Schmidt, who do you call if puzzle pieces are broken? Oh.

Hey, Winston.

Is, uh, is Schmidt home? Cece.

Oh, my goodness.

Hi.

Do you need a hug? All right.

Is Schmidt even here, Winston? Yeah.

Yeah, he's in the shower.

Um Cece, I just want to say, on my end, that I am so, so sorry.

Sorry about what? You know, uh Elizabeth.

Well, what about Elizabeth? He made love to her.

Winston made love to Elizabeth.

After I chose you, Winston was all too quick, in Elizabeth's vulnerable state, to rush in there and just get his jollies off.

His sweaty, disgusting jollies.

Seriously? I mean, she must have just been so upset and hurt I didn't even know you were interested in her.

Tell her what you did, Winston, and give her the short version, which you did not give to Elizabeth.

Wha? What I did um Okay, well, I drove over there to seduce her.

And I seduced her two and a half times.

Puzzle me this, then, Winston How do you live with yourself? I have a bit of a hard time believing that Winston would do this.

Well, then, you obviously don't know Winston, 'cause he's a sick, disgusting human being.

Just this morning he asked me for a pair of your underpants.

Winston? - Hmm? Is that true? Yes.

I needed your underwear to sew into my underwear.

Oh my God.

That is disgusting! You are a pervert! Oh, I'm so sorry, Cece.

Just wait in the car.

You don't have to deal with this disgusting trash person, garbage child! You're upset.

As you should be.

Oh, but that was great, man.

How long as this been going on, man? Four days.

Four days, and you didn't tell me? Come on, Schmidt! I said, "Don't lie to me.

" I'm sorry.

All right? I love both of these women and I couldn't decide.

I needed to buy some more time.

Cece thinks I'm wearing her panties right now! Well, that's on you, man! You freaked out super hard! You-you kidding me? That's so weird.

Sewing people's panties into underpants.

Look, we're not best friends, Schmidt.

As a matter of fact, we're not friends at all until you fix this.

Okay, all right, look.

Winston, I'm sorry, man.

W-Winston, you've been working on this puzzle for quite some time now.

You realize a lot of those puzzle pieces are upside down, right? It's just they're cardboard color.

Is that an almond that you have inserted into one of the pieces? Are you just eating them, or are you using them as pieces? You know that's an almond, right? Schmidt, come here! Free cocktails.

No way! - Yeah, fitting right in.

Oh, my God.

What? Security guard.

Freeze.

Okay, don't freeze.

That looks weird.

Did he notice you? Of course he noticed you.

You're the prettiest girl on the damn beach.

Shut up.

We need one of these bracelets right away, Jess.

Bracelet.

Yeah.

Oh, hey! Hey Hey, pal.

That's a really cool bracelet.

Do you think I could try it on? - No.

Listen to me, okay? Will you lean in here for a second and listen to me? One day, you're gonna meet a girl, you're gonna really like her, and you're gonna want to give her everything, but you won't be able to afford it because your life's kind of in shambles and you don't have money.


Look at you, kid, you got a great-looking face.

I don't know, you might have a tough go of it.

What do I know? Just promise me this Promise me you're gonna try to enjoy your life as much as you can, 'cause one day you're gonna be d*ad, and, you know.

Can I have your bracelet, for real? No.

If you don't give me the bracelet, I'm gonna strangle you to death.

Thanks, buddy.

Not cool.

But it worked, okay? We got the bracelet, so now we're back in action.

Hola.

Hola.

Can I see your bracelets, por favor? Yes.

Looks pretty on her, right? SeÃÂ±or? - Run! - No! I don't speak Spanish, you snake! What are you gonna do? I'm in the ocean now! I'm in international waters! I've got a shell.

Let's just go.

Let's just get out of here.

Point Break style? - No, no, no! I will Point Break style this moment! Nick, let's go! Nick, stop! Aah! Ow! Ow, that hurt! Wait! Where are you taking him?! - Jail.

Aah! Truce, okay? Winston, please, come on Talk to me.

I I need a friend right now.

I love both of these women, and I can't lose them, and I can't hurt them.

And we made a pact! No.

You lied to me.

You're a liar.

Okay, well, then would you like some truth, Winston? Here's some truth for you, okay? You're terrible at puzzles.

Worst I've ever seen by a mile.

What, do you have fly vision? Look at this puzzle.

It's ages six and up.

You are up, Winston.

You are way up! - You want to say that to my face? This is a corner piece, Winston! How do you not see that? What are you, blind?! I'm so sorry actually, a blind man could feel the smooth edges of a corner piece! You are making me so mad.

Ooh, you are making me so mad.

Oh, yeah? You're making me How am I making you? Am I making you? - Yes, you're making me mad.

What you want to do? What are you doing? Which way are you going? What is happening? - Ow! - What did you do? Don't mess with me, man.

I'm legit.

I'm legit, dude.

I'm getting very dizzy.

You coming at me, son? I need all the cash you have and Nick's passport! - What'd you say? What? - Nick's in trouble? What are we doing? Nick is in jail? Nick went to jail before me? Hey, stop it! Stop it! This is not the time for fighting.

Nick is in a Mexican jail.

We don't know this country.

We don't know their laws.

We don't know how to get him out.

I just hope he found somebody who can protect him and take care of him.

What, you hope he's somebody's bitch? - No, like a mentor.

He'd never be picked as a bitch.

Nick is very attractive.

He can be a bitch.

A sissy, perhaps, but a bitch? - He can be a bitch.

He cannot be a bitch.

My God, what's a sissy? - Are you insane? - A chubby gringo? - Stop it! Nick is my bitch.

Hola, seÃÂ±ores, seÃÂ±ora.

Hi.

Um, we have some questions.

Jess, I got this.

I know how to handle these people.

Is this for me? That's for you to send your kids to college, or for you to send some fun up your nose.

Your choice, bro.

Don't worry.

We're looking for our friend Nick Miller if he's still alive, and his head if it's separate.

You know who you should talk to? Manny.

Manny.

Manny.

Talk to Julio.

Julio.

Julio.

Talk to Brad.

I don't really feel right about this.

Oh, Jess, you're so naive.

It's a game.

We're working our way up the ladder.

Brad is clearly the kingpin.

Thanks so much.

Okay, that didn't work.

Next idea.

Well There are no next ideas, Schmidt! We're out of money! I need to just find somebody.

Oh, just find somebody? - Yes.

Right, Jess, 'cause the streets down here - they run red with hospitality.

Hey! Hey! Hi.

Sorry.

I met you yesterday.

You arrested a man named Nick Miller.

You got money? Money.

No, we don't have any money.

But wait, wait, wait! What about his shoes? Any interest in his shoes? There's no way you're getting these damn shoes, okay? These are my favorite brown shoes.

And besides, this is all your fault, Schmidt.

Nick's body's being traded like cigarettes right now! Winston, those shoes are not brown they're green.

What the hell you talking about, man? - Those shoes are green.

You guys are idiots, all right? They're as brown as money.

What color is Kermit the Frog? - Brown.

It's a brown frog.

Winston, you're color-blind, dude.

What? I am not color I am not color-blind.

Doesn't matter.

Doesn't matter.

Sir, I'm so sorry.

We have no money.

We don't even have money for gas.

Oh, you got a car.

Want to trade? Hey.

Oh, my God, I thought he was taking you to jail.

No, it's resort jail, and it's not so bad.

They let me watch Ugly Betty.

Here, I brought you your passport.

Winston, enough! - Enough for me! Oh, Nicholas, thank goodness you're alive.

You brought them? I needed their help.

Winston does not get me at all.

What? And, plus, he's color-blind, which basically makes him crippled.

Please, tell me these shoes are brown, right? - Those shoes are green.

They're definitely green.

Okay, you both are crazy.

Winston! If you think those shoes are brown, what color do you think you are? Jess, I can't do this.

Do you really want to wake up to this every morning? It doesn't matter, as long as I wake up next to you.

I got an idea.

Let's move to Mexico.

What? - Yeah! - Hell no! - Nicolas, I need you.

If you leave, then I'm with Winston, and I can't handle that.

You and me, we work here.

If we go back to the loft, we're not gonna make it.

Yes, we are.

We are gonna make it.

You won't.

He's 100% right.

You will not.

I'm not ready to lose you.

I just got you, Jess.

And I'm not letting you go.

So I'm all in.

I'm shredding this passport.

I'm not leaving Mexico.

Oh, no, you are not, sir! - No, no, no, wait, wait! I will put myself in that shredder before you put your passport in there! Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, switch! - Put yourself in there.

Stop! Stop, Nick! I will shred my ear! I'll do it! - Your ear could go in! - I will shred myself! I will shred myself in the shredder.

Get serious! Stop.

Listen to me.

We're a family.

You can't choose who you love.

Sometimes they choose you.

And sometimes, it's just because you got a really great deal on Craigslist.

I got a really great deal on Craigslist.

I got all of you.

There is no "us" without Schmidt and Winston.

It's gonna be really, really hard.

But so what, Nick? So what? I believe in us.

I'm all in.

I really want to go home.

Come on, man, let's just go home.

You know what? I love you guys.

Okay.

Let's go home.

Great.

Oh, my God! No! Get it out! Get it out! Unplug it, Nick! The shredder shredded it, bro.

No, no, no, no, guys, we're fine.

I can work with this.

Okay, everybody.

Just be cool.

Act normal.

U.

S.

citizens? Passports, please.

What is this? Sir, my name is Winston Bishop.

I'm a color-blind American citizen, and I can't do puzzles.

Now let us go home.

It says "Unatered Stites of Amurica.

" You ready? Hey, I got you something, actually.

I mean, I stole it from a kid, but We can do this.

-Yeah, we can do this.

Yeah.

All right.

Yeah.

Here we go, huh? It's locked.

I think somebody accidentally locked this.

Where's your key? - I don't carry a key.

You don't carry a key? - No, I don't carry a Why would I carry a key? There's always somebody home! And I know how to jimmy the Mmm, my God I like you so much.

I like you, too.

And I'll start carrying a key.

Okay, I'll carry a key for you.

For the love of God, Winston, please just go unlock the door.

This is so weird.

Yeah Sayonara, masturbation, for the rest of my life.

Hey, Cece, it's Schmidt.

Hi.

You want me to come over tonight? I think I can make that work.

Uh, can you give me, like, five minutes? Great.

Um ooh, actually, could you hold on one second? Hi, Elizabeth, my darling.

How are you? Uh, tonight? You want to tonight.

Um, could you just give me one second so I can check my calendar? That'd be great.

I just checked it, and, uh it looks like there's a slight problem.

Um Puzzling I am puzzling Looks good to me.

Hey, guys! Hurry up!

I'm the maid of honor and I have to be there early and I wanna get a picture in before we go.

Miami Vice called and I'm not sure... I don't know how to finish that joke.

What?

Ah, it's a crap joke, scratch it.

Winston, please. Your belly is on my hip.

Dad, can you come and take our picture?

All right.

Having a little trouble getting off this air mattress.

Oh, here we go.

And we... okay. I'm off, I'm off.

Here... where is it? All right, give me this.

Let's do this.

Okay, you ready?

Scrunch together. There we go.

No... uh, Rick, move one step to your right.

Me?

Yes, one step to your right.

One more step to your right.

I can't go much further.

One more step to your right.

Until you get into the hallway, and then, once you get in the hallway... No, I see what you're doing, dude. - Dad, Very funny, buddy. - Dad, Dad, we have to go...

...go directly to the Chinatown trash can where you got that suit. - There's nothing wrong with this suit. - Dad, we need to take the picture.

I wore this at my high school graduation.

Nick, you're not doing yourself any favors.

I look very handsome. I look like I'm on Miami Vice.

Should I take the picture?

No, I'm not doing this.

He's getting on me about the suit.

You're ruining the picture. - Okay.

I'm not doing it. I'm out of here.

Stop. Where are you going?

Was gonna do my cool poses.

You ready? One, two...

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

You changed.

Check it out.

Schmidt gave me his worst suit.

He said, if I could get it over my thighs, he didn't want it.

Miami Vice called, and this time, I answered.

Yeah?

Yeah!

I hope you're not doing all this

'cause of what my dad said.

I don't think you're an unemployable alcoholic bummer.

What?

No, I don't think you're a child.

Whoa, when did he say that?

Hmm?

What?

Bob said that about me?

Anyway, the point is... I don't think you're any of those things.

We're at a wedding together.

It's nice, right? You look great.

Thanks. So do you.

I'm gonna go find Cece.

Yeah.

All right, I guess we're doing that.

There are so many fun, cool traditions at this thing.

The groom comes in on a white horse.

So, basically, they're just copying my Bar Mitzvah.

Oh, my goodness.

That is Bucky the Badger, Wisconsin's mascot.

Yeah, I got a sweatshirt with his face on it, and he's wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it.

Bucky cool. Bucky!

He's got a super weird thing with badgers.

Is that a real badger?

Hey, the ceremony lasts for three hours, so you better go pee now. You know, your weak bladder.

You remembered.

Of course I did.

Now I have to pee. Every time you say "pee," I have to pee.

Thank you for coming.

Go pee. Okay.

I'm gonna.

It's okay to be nervous.

But nothing can go wrong.

All you have to do is go out there, get married, and I will do the rest, okay?

Schmidt!

Get out.

Well, this certainly isn't the bathroom.

Get out. Get out.

Guys, guys, shut up and listen to me - it's Cece.

She doesn't want to get married.

Damn. - What happened?

Well, her exact words were: "I don't want to marry Shivrang, "but my whole family has flown out here from all the way across the world.

I can't back out now. Please, Schmidt, as my closest friend, help me."

What did Jess say?

Well, Jess didn't hear it -

Cece told me with her eyes.

Oh, so nothing happened. - Cool, so she's marrying Shivrang. - No, guys, I know Cece -

I know her looks.

Schmidt, what were you doing back there?

Cece's backing out of the wedding.

What?

It's true. She told me.

With her eyes.

Oh, my God.

I thought you were talking about something real. Schmidt.

The wedding's happening - let her go.

I have let her go. I'm with Elizabeth now and she's amazing.

Look, Jess, I'm telling you this as Cece's friend and nothing more.

Cece loves Shivrang - I know that 'cause I know her better than you do.

False. When you've had sexual congress with someone and you've peered into their soul at the exact moment of fulfillment... Ew.

No, no, hear him out.

Schmidt, listen up and listen good.

You are not to talk to Cece, you are not to look at Cece, and you are not to have eye conversations with her.

Or I will bust you.

Hard.

And later, I'm gonna bust you hard.

Yeah, you are.

Good night, nurse. I've been naughty.

Sorry, I didn't know - you guys were supposed... not supposed to hear that, so... Bros ever before the ho.

Anybody have a jar?

I'm sorry, okay?

But we have to sabotage this wedding.

Winston?

No, guys, look, you always bring me into these situations, and I get in over my head because I love pranks.

I really do. I mean, you know that.

Yeah. - But look, it's time for me to just face the facts that I'm no good at them.

You know, I'm 31 now, and it's time for me to cut the nonsense.

You're 100% right, man, but just, I don't know... what about today, just today... you give me full-on crazy?

Yeah!

You listen here!

Hey, hey, hey. Nobody's doing anything!

Yeah! - What?

What?

Jess asked us not to, so we are going to enjoy Cece's wedding like adults.

So good night, nurse.

Sorry for saying that.

I am all... I'm all turned around.

We sabotaging this thing or what?

Absolutely.

Hello, Auntie.

This is embarrassing.

I'll be right back.

Excuse me, Elizabeth. Can I talk business?

Yeah.

Thank you.

I want you to call it off.

What?

Whatever you're planning on doing, don't do it.

This wedding means a lot to Jess.

What are you doing?

What has happened to you?

You changed your suit, you're carrying her purse. - Yeah, I am.

You're wearing deodorant under both arms... Both arms, yeah.

Why are you trying so hard, man? Either Jess wants the real you or... or she don't.

The real Nick would help me sabo this wedding.

Is "sabo" short for sabotage, Schmidt?

Why would you...?

I mean, why would you even say that?

I knew it was. I was being mean.

I was bullying you to get dominance in this moment.

You know it... of course you know... you know it is.

I want you to call it off.

You know it's... You know "sabo" is short for sabot... sabotage.

I know... I know... Hey, skin it and call it off.

You got it, man.

Thanks, man.

I'll call it off. No problem, Nicholas.

Thank you, buddy. I appreciate that.

Thank you.

Now.

Now?

Shivrang, hold on!

Ow, my testicles!

Don't get on the highway!

Just reared up and just took off... I'm scared that it might have damaged me.

No, no, no, no damage.

Are you enjoying the wedding festivities, Schmidt?

What a spunky horse.

I know you're responsible for the horse thing.

Was I?

Yes.

Was I?

Yes.

Was...?

Yes.

Was...?

Yes.

Was I?

Yes.

Was I?

Schmidt.

âª If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe âª
âª I'd been married a long time ago âª
âª Where did you come from, where did you go? âª
âª Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? âª
âª If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe... âª

It's okay. Who are you working with?

âª Where did you come from?

âª Where did you go?

âª Where did you come from... Cotton-Eyed... Joe.

âª Where did you come from, where did you go? âª

Winston, no! Don't do this.

What's done is done, Nicholas.

Turn it off! - I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to.

Turn it off!

Nick!

Pranks!

Wrong way!

What... What did you... Of course!

Of course you were scheming with Schmidt.

Jess, I didn't do anything.

You think that Schmidt and Winston would be smart enough to duct-tape the sound board?

That's brilliant!

Plus, we both know that this is your CD.

âª Where did you come from, where did you go? âª
âª Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? âª

Why did you need me for this?

Nick?

Winston must have taken that out of my car.

How gullible do you think I am? You're fist-pumping right now.

No, I'm not fist-pumping.

Yes, you are.

Aah!

It's so freaking catchy.

I thought I could count on you.

I thought things would be different now.

How could you think I would do this at your best friend's wedding?

Because it's exactly the type of thing that you do.

A stupid, childish prank.

Oh, childish?

You're right.

I'm a child.

Great sabo, man!

I'm so good at pranks, man.

I feel alive.

Really good... Phase three.

What's phase three? Whatever it is, I'm in.

Let's do this.

Uh, hey, Jess?

Hmm?

We went too far.

What?

It's bad.

How bad?

It's really bad.

Schmidt... What did you do?

It was Winston's idea.

Oh, my God.

I'm really sorry, okay? I didn't want anybody to get hurt, but it's too late now.

It's bigger than all of us.

Tell me everything.

Or, so help me God, I will mess up your hair.

Your precious hair.

Winston's in the... What?

Winston's in... What? Say it louder. Say it louder.

Winston is in the air ducts with a badger.

What?!

Nick's there, too.

Ah, Nick.

You've never gone along with one of my pranks before.


This is exciting.

I never noticed, but you kind of have a girl butt. Is that weird to say?

This priest is never gonna know what h*t him.

Wait, that is the plan?

You're gonna drop a badger on a priest?

Oh! He's mad.

That can't be the plan, man!

What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?

I deserve this. I deserve this. I deserve this, okay?

It's just, when Nick got involved, it became too big.

What? What do you mean, "when Nick got involved"?

He wasn't always involved?

No. He said no.

He said, "Jess means too much to me," or some crapola like that.

What are you doing?

Calling Nick.

Jess, he's in the ducts!

The ducts!

Beautiful ceremony.

Happy day.

The ducts!

I know where he is, Schmidt.

What? No, no.

That's my phone.

I said no phones.

I know. I'm gonna get it.

They can track us with phones.

What is going...? Relax. You're so weird with pranks.

What is going on with you?

Put the phone away!

I'm trying to! I'm trying to turn it off, you idiot!

Oh... no.

What's going on?

Uh... Bucky got out of his cage, man.

No! No! I'm getting out of here!

Let's go get him. No, you're coming with me.

You got to help me find the badger, Nick!

You don't be no bitch!

I want out of this place!

Bucky!

God bless both of you.

May he shower you with many, many children.

Ugh, he's not picking up.

Of course he's not picking up. He's in the... - Don't say it.

...ducts.

He's in the ducts.

Nick, stop being a bitch! Don't be no bitch!

Bucky!

I'm going up there.

Okay, good.

'Cause I really don't want to go up there. Look, I'm the kind of guy that likes to enjoy the AC, not see how the sausage is made.

Seriously, Schmidt? Shut up and give me a boost.

Bucky... Aah.

Winston!

Nick, where are you?

Marco... Polo!

I don't want to play that.

No!

Nick, it's me!

Nick, it's me!

Jess, what are you doing here?

Look, I-I know you didn't plan the sabotage, and I know you're doing this just to get back at me, but please don't do this.

Jess, it's not about the sabotage, okay?

It's about the fact that you think I'm gonna screw up everything I touch.

No, Nick, I don't.

You know what, Jess?

This is where I belong.

With Winston and a badger.

All right, Nick, look, let's just go get the badger and get out of here.

Can't get the badger because it's loose.

What?!

Hey, Jess, welcome, welcome.

No! Jess!

You know, I'm just staying positive, but, uh... I'm pretty sure this is where we die.

Winston!

When you complete the seven circles, you will be officially married.

You don't have to walk so fast, you know.

Guys?

Guys, you know... I've been thinking a lot about the Earth.

We got to leave it better than when we found it.

Is this what you wanted your life to be?

Is this how you wanted to enjoy your best friend's wedding?

Nick, look, no. Stop that.

I am not a healthy person.

Yeah, I know. I know, Nick.

Oh, you do?

So a part of you agrees with your dad.

No.

Just... oh, my... Okay. We got to get out of here.

...lovely ceremony with all your family and friends.

Tell me that there isn't a small part of you that's scared that I'm too much of a mess.

We have to go.

That this thing is a mistake.

You and me.

Just admit it, Jess.

Yes, there is a small part.

Yeah.

But... Run!

Oh, my... It's okay.

Jess?

Always a bridesmaid... Aah! Something touched my leg!

You know, sometimes I feel like I never really felt love, you know?

Do you know?

Hey! Hey, hey, everybody.

Hi. Hi. I'm Jessica Day. I'm the, uh, maid of honor.

I'm also the person who fell through the roof with my friend Nick Miller here.

Um, I have a few things to say.

Um, there might be a badger on the loose, but I have my best people on it.

I'm on it. Don't scare the badger!

Schmidty, help me!

Okay!

Funnel it into the mandap!

Okay.

Hey, guys. He's in the ninth row.

He is headed north.

Where were we? Um, Your Honor, please tell us where we were.

We were on the seventh circle.

So close.

Great. Cece, go.

Jess, you don't have to fix this.

Fix what?

This is a perfect day.

I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.

And it's not because of the horse.

Or the badger.

Or "Cotton-Eyed Joe."

This isn't what I want.

What I want is to be with someone else.

Shivrang, I feel terrible. I'm sorry.

No... No, Cece, it is okay.

In fact, it's more than okay.

I don't know why I didn't tell you the truth ages ago, but... but I want to be with someone else, too.

Really?

Yes.

I have tried to forget you, Elaine - really, I have - but I just can't.

Who the hell is Elaine?

And I don't care what my family says.

I want to marry you in a Presbyterian church.

Oh, Shivvy.

I've loved you since the first grade.

And I'm so lonely without you. I just lay awake at night, and I just write about you in my journal, and I paint pictures of you on my easel.

I want our children to be photographers and... and backpack across Europe.

Will you take me away from this madness?

And you are not too short for me. I don't care what your mother says.

Oh, Elaine!

Come!

Let's go to Vegas and elope!

I feel slightly rejected.

Well... you were slightly rejected.

Yeah.

You okay?

Well, I'm not as good as Elaine.

Who could be?

I feel better than I've felt in a long time.

Good. I'm glad.

Boobies.

I don't think the badger's actually rabid. I think, um... he's just kind of a dick. So... Hey, Nick.

You okay?

Me? Yeah.

You mean from the fall?

Yeah. And... what we talked about.

Yeah. Look, Jess, it's not... you know, that big of a deal.

And we tried. It's just... You might be right about your fears, you know, it's... Just... just say it.

I-I think we should call it, you know?

It's not like we're in love or anything.

We had one night.

Okay, let's call it.

I think that feels good to me.

Does that feel good to you?

But you must have feelings for her.

You tried to sabotage her wedding.

I sabotaged her wedding as a friend.

I didn't want her to marry someone else as a friend.

It's only mantic because it's a wedding.

I would be just as happy to sabotage, I don't know... let's say, her tax audit.

Schmidt.

Weird day, huh?

It's a beautiful wedding, Cece.

Thank you.

It was Schmidt that you were talking about, right?

It was.

I'm-I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

Don't be sorry. It's not your problem. It's Schmidt's.

Why is it... Why is it my problem?

Who's it gonna be?

Me or her?

No, she's right.

You have to choose.

We're gonna do this now?

But can... can we sleep on it, maybe? Maybe take the night?

I've got... I just got this brand-new Coldplay bootleg. Live from Rotterdam.

What if we just make some pasta and really listen to it?

Are you in love with her or are you in love with me?

You have to decide.

Can I get a beer?

Heisler?

Perfect.

Hey, man.

Hey.

Bucky bit me.

Bit me bad.

Hmm.

Yeah. So, um... so I'm pretty dizzy.

Okay.

Okay, what happened with Jess?

We called it.

And she left.

Yeah, we-we called it off.

So, now I'm gonna drink, because that's my move.

Yeah. That was also your dad's move.

Yeah, when things get messy, you just run away.

But, you know, there are other moves.

Go.

Thanks, man.

Hey, bartender, can you call an ambulance?

I'm about to bleed out.

Thanks, man.

Look, I know you think we should call it, but I don't want to give up on this, even if we don't know what this is.

I want to un-call it.

Please, can we un-call it?

Before you say no... Don't say no.

âª Down, down in my bones... Hey, give me the keys.

Where are we going?

I don't know.

Where did we come from?

Where do we go?

Where did we come from?

Shut up.

Yeah, that was

"Cotton-Eyed Joe," wasn't it?

âª You talk to me... I felt like something was gonna happen.

Let's go!

Let's go!

âª So let's go to bed âª Before you say something real... âª

Turn left.

No, I'm going to make three rights.

- No, Nick, just turn left!

No, it's slower my way.

Why would you want to go slower?

âª 'Cause it's you âª Oh, it's always you

Fantastico.

Are you checking my pulse?

You were very still.

Well, that was really fun.

I don't know what to say here. Um... I got an idea. Stay right here, okay?

Okay.

Let me do something. Stay right here.

Okay.

We need some dessert.

That's too much.

Nah, definitely not doing that.

Bob!

You. It's... you.

Nick.

Right. Nick. How could I forget that?

Sorry to interrupt you. Wilson let me in.

Well, what are you doing with that?

That, uh, looks like lady food.

This is for Wilson.

Yeah, Wilson, here's your grapefruit, pie and eggs, just like you like.

Is it because it's my birthday?

It's your birthday?

That's why I made it, 'cause it's your birthday.

I know you're lying, and I'm hurt, but I'm gonna eat this anyway.

See you later, Wilson.

What are you doing here, Bob?

The wedding!

I wouldn't miss Cece's wedding. Where's Jess?

Hey, Nick, what's our la...?

Look who I bumped into - your dad!

Dad!

Your dad is here today, Jess!

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

Are the reviews in?

The reviews for what?

My new body.

How it moves.

Its pitch, its yaw.

My perfectly sculpted pubic topiary.

I liked how your body moved before you knew what to do with it.

Want to dance?

Yeah, right.

Fat kid wants to dance at the cool college party.

Nice joke, stranger.

Come on.

If they make fun of you, I'll punch them in the penis.

You never cared about what people thought.

I mean, even last night, with the window open and the woof howls.

It was very uncomfortable.

Stop thr*at to move, Bernie, and just move!

I love that about you.

I'm gonna go to work. Do you want to have lunch later?

It's still impressive, but did you lose weight down...?

It's slightly smaller.

Doctors - no explanation.

That's not normal.

Shut up, Bernie!

Shut up, Bernie!

He can never find out about this, because he will k*ll you.

When I was ten, he caught me kissing Glenn Ely.

He got some guys from the club to put the fear of God in him.

Help!

So, let me deal with him.

Smile!

I got to get some new flash cubes.

Dude, keep your mouth shut. Okay?

Great, fantastic.

Hey, Dad?

Yeah?

Why don't we take a walk? Oh, it's Peg.

Peg.

Hi, Jess.

Guess what? I'm at a new school, and there's an opening for a new teacher, and you'd be perfect. Can you come in today?

Yeah, I would love to. I just - um, my dad's in town, so... I'm kind of out on a limb here. I really talked you up to the principal.

Guess what. Spoiler alert. He's perking me.

Can you be here in 30 minutes?

Okay, I'll figure it out.

Amy! Put those back in your shirt, both of them.

Oh, my God. I have the chance to teach kids again.

You got to go.

Oh... Dad, you should come with me.

Yes, you should go with your daughter!

What am I gonna do, sit in your car and get mugged?

I mean, I didn't gay my way out of Vietnam just to be k*lled by some punk.

No, no. No, I'll stay with him.

Oh, no, no, that, uh, that doesn't work.

That's a bad idea.

That's - I've-I've got stuff I got to do, so... Stuff?

Yeah.

You don't have any stuff. Name one stuff.

Documents.

Documents?

Yeah, I got documents.

Okay, I get it.

You know, I'm always alone, so, I'll just, uh... be alone.

Do not fall for it.

I am falling for it.

Do not fall for it. - I am falling for it right this second. I'm feeling bad.

I'll stay!

That's terrific.

Jess... Jess.

Hi! Yay, tomorrow's your big day! Hooray!

Listen, I'm gonna be a little bit later than I thought I would be, but it's gonna be worth it, because last night... Just hang on. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

Guys, it's too loud in here, okay?!

Uncle Shishir!

He had one scene with Salman Khan in Dabangg 2, and all of the sudden he thinks he's Amitabh Bachchan in Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.

I could just tell you later.

I am exhausted, and I still have to go pick up my wedding sari, and I still have to get my hands henna'd.

Okay, look, just send everybody to their hotels.

I'll have Winston pick up your sari, and then after you're done having your hands tattooed, take a nap.

Now hand the phone to Shishir.

Uncle. Jess.

Shishir, you son of a bitch. You little son of a bitch.

It is not your day!

Hey, Winston.

What's up?

Anything you want to wish me?

Look, Winston, I need you to pick up Cece's wedding sari and take it to her house.

You want me to take it to her house?

Yeah. Just go pick it up.

Ah, wedding sari, for the celebration of the wedding.

Yes, nothing else.

Yeah, I don't know what you're doing, but just do it, okay? Um, I have to go.

It's happening!

Peg, hi. Thank you so much for the interview.

Sorry I'm late.

Uh, no interview.

You're getting right in the soup; you're subbing.

I need Al to see you in action.

What? Subbing?

It's a really busy day; I don't think I could sub... Oh, yes you can.

...right now.

What? No.

This is your chance.

Oh, my... Ah, stop! You have to stop!

Hey, guys.

All right.

Okay, listen!

Or don't!

But the hell if I'm not gonna teach!

I'm gonna bring the words of Mark Twain alive with only the human voice.

What about you? You got a girl?

No. No, no, no, no, no.

No, really?

No, no, no, no. No girls for me. No.

Seriously? A good-looking guy like you?

It'd seem like women would just flock to you. - No, no, it's not like that.

Let's talk about you and girls! I don't want to talk about this. - ...and a young guy.

This isn't something we should talk about, Bob, trust me! - Okay, gee whiz, I'm sorry.

Just freakin' back off.

I'm sorry I brought it up.

All right.

What?

What?

There's a girl. Yes.

There is, see? I told you.

I knew - There's always a girl.

There - you're right.

Come on, what's she like?

She's, uh, not quirky.

No?

She's got no bangs.

No bangs.

Uh, tall and fat.

Really?

Yeah. Really ugly eyes.

Small, tiny little beady eyes.

Yeah. Yeah.

Her name is, uh, Yolanda Winston.

Yolanda Winston.

Just wallpaper! I have fancy athletic shoe wallpaper.

Elizabeth, what are you doing here?

I got here early, so I wanted to come up.

That shirt is, uh...

12 years old.

It's the shirt I met you in.

Oh, yeah, I remember that.

Y2 Kitty Kat.

As relevant today as it was then.

Schmidt, do you have a moment?

I have unlimited moments.

I was reviewing the numbers... Custodial keeps sending us these spooky Eastern European girls.

You want to see spooky? Call me spooky again.

I'll spook the ass fat right out of your lips.

Do you know her?

Mm... no... No?

I... I feel like I'm trap... I'm being trapped, am I not?

Then I'll do you a favor and set you free.

Idiot.

Wait, don't leave. Elizabeth!

I don't know why I just did that!

I knew you couldn't change back!

But why are you wearing that shirt?!

I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad about myself! I love this shirt!

Y2 Kitty Kat?

I don't need this.

I was fine before you showed up.

In fact, I said no to a date tonight to be with you!

I'm gonna text him "Yes."

And guess what.

I don't care what you think.

See ya, Schmidt.

Without validation, the parking rates are absurd.

Jamie, enough with the globes. We get it. You're angry.

Okay, that's lunch. Be back in an hour.


Jess!

I'm Dr. Foster.

Oh.

Peg has gone on and on and on and on and on about you.

So nice to meet you. I'm just running out for lunch... Uh! No, no, need. No need.

During the lunch that I... But you don't need.

We can have lunch here.

My secretary is bringing food.

So we'll have a chitchat, tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, exchange-ideas kind of lunch.

To see how you'll fit in to the Coolidge culture.

Um, well, long story short, I really would love this job, I love teaching kids... Ha!

Now, what if you weren't referring to children... Oh. Uh-huh?

...but to baby goats?

Huh.

That's an interesting question.

Well, we used to have a school goat named Melvin.

Uh... He hanged himself, tragically, on the swing set.

So... we bought another goat.

Also named Melvin.

Surprise!

Yeah, you can come out now!

I see some-some food over here. Where my cake at?

Hey, where my cake at?!

I can hear you giggling, I can see the... Where's my sari?

Something on your face. What's that, like, a wedding tattoo? - What do you mean there's something on my face?

Wait-wait a minute. Hold-hold on, hold on. What are you doing?

Lettuce, tomato, lettuce, meat-meat-meat-meat-meat- meat-meat-meat-meat, cheese, lettuce.

You're a sandwich genius.

Is there anything you don't know everything about?

Try me.

All right, I will try you. I've got a question about Yolanda Winston.

Sure.

Well, we've only slept together once, but, Bob, I don't know what she wants.

Well, the first thing you got to figure out is what do you want.

Well, I don't know how you get a podcast, but you should look into it.

Bob here.

Hey, Dad, new plan. Headed over to Cece's.

How's it going over there?

Great. We're making sandwiches, we're talking about girls.

Interesting. Could you hand the phone to Nick?

Jess. Yeah, she wants to talk to you.

Oh, cool. Jess!

What is going on over there, Nick?!

Hanging out with my boy Bobby D.

Bobby D! I love that!

Talking about girls?!

That's the one thing you should not be talking about!

You are freaking out about noth... Hey, you know what?

I don't like what's happening here. I am coming home.

Just relax. I think he really likes me.

Oh, it's Cece. I have to take this.

Cece, hi.

What's going on?

I fell asleep on my hand!

Oh!

It's not as bad as I thought.

I'm getting married tomorrow, and I look like Mike Tyson!

Okay, nothing a little cotton b*lls and olive oil can't fix.

In a few minutes, we are gonna laugh about this. We will laugh.

Okay.

This is funny later.

Okay.

Uh-huh.

Oh, see?

It's coming right off.

Um... All gone?

Burkas isn't you guys, is it?

This girl really means a lot to me, Bob.

And I just don't want to screw it up.

Why would you screw it up?

I don't want to make excuses, but my dad was kind of a... a piece of... You know, truth be told, Bob, I'm afraid I'm a lot like him.

The mere fact that you just said that means that you're nothing like your old man.

Any girl would be lucky to have a guy like you.

You mean that?

Yes, I do.

Think I'm gonna say something that might make you real happy.

That little girl I was talking about, Yolanda?

Her name isn't Yolanda.

It's Jess.

She's your daughter.

I'll k*ll you!

You're d*ad! You're d*ad!

Hi, you-you tattooed my friend this morning for her wedding.

Is there a quick way of getting it off?

Uh-huh. Okay!

Um, wonderful. Thank you so much, Dipti.

That's awesome. Thanks.

It's not coming off.

Nope, it's not.

Absolutely not.

Okay, look, um, Cece, I think maybe you should call Shivrang.

I don't want him to see me like this, Jess!

Like, what have you done?!

What I've done?

You're the dummy who fell asleep on your hands!

I'm so sorry. That shouldn't have come out of my mouth.

That was really uncool. I've just had a crazy 24 hours, and... I slept with Nick last night.

You slept with Nick?

I don't know.

I think it might be the start of something, like, really amazing.

Mm-hmm, sure. - I don't want to get my hopes up, but it could be something.

Could not be something.

Makes sense.

I don't know.

I have a full beard!

No.

Oh, no, no.

I'm not scared of you, dude.

What are you doing with that?

Put that down; I'm not gonna hurt you.

Okay.

Okay, conversation's over.

Nick, hands up, back away. What is this?

Dad, you're coming with me now.

You want to get rid of me?

So you two can do it again?

What?!

You told him?! God, I knew you would blurt it out.

Shows how much you know; I didn't blurt it out.

I told him on purpose.

Why would you do that?!

What is wrong with you?!

I wanted him to like me - in fact, I want all fathers to like me.

I wonder what that's about.

W-What, do you owe money on the rent?

I mean, what-what is going on here?

Dad, I don't know what's going on.

We haven't had a chance to talk it out yet.

Well, when did this happen?

Last night.

Nick!

Why am I telling you this?

Jess, why are you picking him? He's a lazy, drunken cable thief.

Wh-What's wrong with Wilson?

Dad, there's nothing wrong with Nick.

You don't even know him.

I do know him.

I know him.

When I was young, I was confused, I was lost, I had no plan.

But I went ahead and got married anyway.

And if I had figured things out before I got married, I might still be with your mother.

So I do know you.

You're not your father.

You're me.

And I'm not good enough for my little girl.

Yeah I got my own damn cake, and you can't have none!

I got to... No, I really... Nick, wait, Nick... Damn it, Dad!

You know I'm right.

Oh, I have to go.

I have to go back to school now.

You sure you want to be eating so much cake with a body like that?

Guys?

Guys?

I've had a bad day!

Sit down!

All of you!

What is with everyone today?

Everything started so good.

Boy.

My roommate.

It was good, I'm not gonna lie.

It was very good.

But I can't date my dad.

Look... life's messy.

It kicks you in the ass.

That's right, I said "ass."

But it does, it kicks you in the ass.

And, um... the messy parts are the... best parts.

Thank you, Miguel.

The gesture is very sweet.

These are very bad for you.

I've got a car.

I could take you to the movies.

No, you don't... You do?

Jess called you?

Yeah, she said you needed me.

She also told me to watch out for the girl who looked like Mandy Patinkin We can't get married like this.

Hey, look, if this is our biggest problem, I'll take it.

I'll make a call and fix it.

Now that your mom's d*ad, do you do all the landlording yourself?

Uh-huh.

You want to dance?

I'm wearing the shirt that you got me.

Did you think I threw it away?

Frogetaboutit.

Go home, Schmidt.

I don't want to go home, Elizabeth.

Look, I want to be with you.

Anl-I don't care who knows it.

Hey, Geppetto.

Make with the "oom pah pah."

We have a pump that can blow that thing up in, like, two seconds.

I prefer to do this the old-fashioned way.

I know that's not the way things are done around here.

So long as I'm in town, I am going to sleep between you and him.

Dad, you don't have to worry about me.

I know you think this is gonna be a mess, but it's my mess.

Jess, I'm your father I'll always worry about you.

_

âª What do you say âª Is this the time âª For one more try âª At a happy life... This was the breakfast I was gonna give you this morning.

âª Is this unwise âª To think my fears... Hey, um... I hope my dad didn't get in your head.

No.

Uh, no, uh... Oh, look who took the romance spot.

We were just gonna match up constellations with the mole patterns on my back.

Then we're gonna get drunk and try to find people doing it.

Yeah.

First come, first serve. Scram.

Oh, is that how it is now?

You just own the roof?

Hey, what's everybody do...?

You guys remembered?

Oh, my good... This whole time, I thought you guys forgot.

Is that a golden telescope?

You know how much I love to explore space and time, man!

Thank you! - Happy birthday!

I love you.

Happy birthday.

Hey, happy birthday!

It's the birthday boy.

Come here, I'm gonna set it up for you.

Why can't I have the telescope?

But it's my telescope.

Thought it was for me.

Get in, get into it, man.

Yay, the birthday boy!

Get into it. - Get in there, birthday boy!

Happy birthday, Winston.

What is that? What are you doing?

WINSTON Oh, my goodness.

Oh, hey, guys, you have any hair you want removed? Hey.

I must respectfully decline such a horribly depressing invitation.

Going on a date with Elizabeth tonight. I haven't had sex with her since I was fat and accessing my penis was like getting the remote control out of the couch.

Now I know things, and I own things.

Like this.

What is that?

Oh, my God, that poor girl.

This is the Archduke.

The crowning achievement of the German Institute of Female Pleasure.

Dude, this thing takes single A batteries?

I thought I threw that thing out the window.

That only made it stronger. 

WINSTON Oh, that reminds me Daisy called, and we're going out tonight.

(chuckles)

Yeah, she sounded pretty excited.

I do believe her exact words were, "This is your last chance."

So, I'm very confident.

Yeah.

Very confident.

(cell phone rings)

Schmidt, can you help me with my phone? I have...

Oh, you need help?

Where's your women's lib now?

From Teddy

"In town tonight. Would love to see you. p.m. drinks?"

CECE Oh, my God, Teddy.

JESS Oh, my God.

Hey, who's Teddy?

Whoa, hey, man.

What are you doing...?

JESS Nick? Weird and gross.

Sometimes I just sit in the stall and listen to you guys.

Who's Teddy?

OTHERS Makes sense.

What do you think he wants? You think I should meet him for a drink?

Am I the only one kind of dying to know who this Teddy character is?

I think I speak for all of us...

Nick, you and Jess didn't work out, okay?

No...

MoveOn.org.

Yeah, "ww" It's not

about that, just...

Chill out.

Yeah, no. Thanks.

JESS

Fine. Look. Um... (sighs)

I already regret this. Teddy...

Teddy took my flower.

Wow, yeah, he did.

What flower? What?!

Yeah, he stole a flower from you?

(chuckles)

And you want to have drinks with him?

Oh, from your wonderful secret garden.

CECE Ugh.

Oh, my God. You guys do have to hear this story, though.

'Cause it is the worst. It's the worst!

No, no.

It's the worst.

They...

I guarantee you it's not any more embarrassing than the story of me losing my virginity.

I promise you mine's worse than all of yours.

Prom night. .

What was the theme?

Yeah, who cares about the theme?

What were you wearing?

I want to know the theme.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

JESS It was after prom.Cece and I were both ,

and we'd rented a hotel room.

So...

would you like to freak?

Yes, I would.

("Stay " by Lisa Loeb plays)

âª So âª
âª And I thought what I felt was simple... âª

I'm gonna freak you toward the bed.

Do I have your permission?

Yes, you do.

âª And now that I am leaving âª
âª Now I know that I... âª

So, he and I were the founding members of the Gender Equality Society.

Also, the only members of the Gender Equality Society.

We both asked each other to the prom in the spirit of gender equality, and we both said yes.

Okay, get to it. No one cares.

Oregon sucks.

I'm gonna take off your dress.

Do I have your permission?

Yup. Yup.

Okay.

âª I only hear what I want to âª

Um...

I can't find the zipper.

Oh.

Oh, there is no zipper.

Um, I made this dress, and my mom sewed me in, so...

Um, maybe I can try in the abdominal area here?

Is that okay? Do I have your permission?

Yes. You have my permission.

Unwind the...

Oh.

Maybe if, um... You know, um, 'cause maybe you could just rip it.

âª I turn the radio up... âª

I... I just want to make sure you're feeling safe...

No, no, no. II feel, like, so safe, and, like, I've never felt, like, more safe.

Well, do I have your permission...

Just be a man and rip it off...

âª When we weep for the other âª
âª Who was dying since the day they were born âª
âª Well, well... âª

Now I'm feeling very unsafe.

âª But I'm thrown âª

(softly)

Um...

âª And I thought I'd live forever... âª

Um...

I think, um, I'm gonna go, um, get... like, I'll see if the front desk has a seam ripper.

(booing)

Come on, Jess.

Get to the sex part.

If this is another story about sewing, I swear to God...

Please. I'm getting there.

(sighs)

YOUNG MAN

You okay?

Yeah.

JESS

Oh, man.

He wore the hell out of those tuxedo pants.

People have told me I look really good in tuxedos, so...

I don't think I've ever seen you in a tux.

I've worn a tuxedo. (scoffs)

Everybody has tuxedos.

Tuxedo is different than a suit.

It is?

Wait, didn't he have a guitar?

Oh, my God, yes.

Best part.

BOTH

âª And now that I am leaving âª
âª I know that I did something wrong âª
âª 'Cause I missed you âª
âª Yeah, yeah âª
âª 'Cause I missed you. âª

(booing)

SCHMIDT Lame.

(sighs)

Man...

(sighs)

Prom is so stupid, right?

Yeah, and, like, what is "prom" short for?

I think it's actually "promenade."

So, you want a man?

You want a... want a man?

Okay, there are no scissors in there, so I taped these two steak knives together.

Now, do I have your permission to just...

Oh! Aah!

Oh, my God.

(groaning)

Uh, I have... to deal with this...

(strumming "Stay" by Lisa Loeb)

So, you mean to tell me you didn't lose your virginity at prom?

Technically, no.

Technically?

Damn it, Jess.

Technically, why did we listen to that whole story, then?

Technically, this guy's the worst. (chuckles)

There was no sex.

Playing guitar for girls.

Girls don't like that.

That's a fact.

(sighs)

It's okay, man.

What's okay?

I wasn't done yet, guys.

I was in the prologue.

David Foster Wallace, where is the sex?

You're in last place.

Cece, please go.

Tell your story of how your lost your virginity.

I need a palate cleanse.

Actually, it was the same night.

SCHMIDT It was prom night?

Really?

Who was it with?

Study Hall Steve or Cool Car Johnny?

(chuckling)

Oh, yeah.

Not exactly.

Not them.

So what? I'm a virgin.

I don't want to plan it out.

Whatever happens, happens.

MAN (British accent)

Oh, hello.

I'd like to make love to you.

(whispering)

That's Mick Jagger.

What?! Whoa!

What?

SCHMIDT

Game changer!

Freaking...

Beatlemania!

Beatlemania!

Keep it together, Schmidt.

Oh, my...

The Beatles?!

He was just on tour in Portland, and we just started talking, and then we started laughing...

âª âª

What... but I'm confused.

Uh, Cece, that is not an embarrassing story.

Yeah, I know.

But I just love telling it.

Yeah.

Cece, you officially move into last place.

Boom. Moving up, worst story.

Jess, you have no chance of winning.

SCHMIDT It was my junior year of college. I was about pounds heavier.

Freshman plus h*m*

plus junior .

I got some lubricant.

It's to use on a woman.

Uh...

to increase her pleasure.

Hey... is it chill if I have the room later?

Elizabeth and I have been talking, and... we plan on merging tonight.

Yeah, Schmidt!

Penis, vag*na.

Penis, vag*na.

The room's all yours, cowboy.

Yeah, I got some, uh, mushrooms, and I'm going to a Dave Matthews concert later.

I'm a Daver.

(Jess groans)

CECE That sucks!

WINSTON White people.

Is this the first time you'll be making... full love?

No way, Jose.

Look, Nick... back in high school, they used to call me... the Sex... the Sex Hammer.

That's a great nickname.

But, you know, now that we're sitting here talking, would you mind having a discussion, uh, openly about the subject of intercourse?

sh**t.

Cool.

Hey, does it hurt for the guys?

Not one bit.

If I pee while it's happening, will she die?

How many minutes before sex is it... is it okay to eat?

I don't think it's an exact science.

I think it depends on your frame.

So, I should eat right before.

In terms of lubricant, do I put a small amount everywhere or do I use a large amount

in a small... in a smaller area?

(groans)

You're harshing my vibe,

Schmidt.

You're the coolest, Nick.

You know, so I'd already taken the mushrooms.

Obviously.

And I was ready to go to the concert, when I realized that the troll at the end of my bed was pretty upset about it.

I don't want any trouble. I think you're a remarkable creature.

(quietly)

No.

Oh... I feel hot in my pants.

(laughs)

I still don't understand why you didn't just leave.

I've told you a million times, my arm was a magnet and the walls were magnetic.

What about that do you not understand?

âª I submit to your demands âª
âª I will do anything âª
âª Girl, you need only ask... âª

ELIZABETH That's a real big jar of lube, man.

Wait, why are you rubbing it on your leg?

No, that's my arm.

Aah! Eyes, eyes, eyes!

Oh, stop moving so much. You're too slippery.

âª ...when you want me to âª
âª And I will not let go... âª

Oh, this lube is so slippery.

(screams)

(screams)

(both grunt)

(groaning)

Schmidt, where are you?

I can't see.

(whispering)

Sex.

II think there's enough lube.

I think we can do it now.

(whispering)

All right. Get up.

(Nick grunting)

You definitely shouldn't be going to get more.

âª I'm just gonna concentrate on you âª
âª Girl, are you ready? âª
âª It's gonna be a long night âª
âª Throw your clothes âª
âª Throw your clothes âª
âª On the floor âª
âª On the floor âª
âª I'm gonna take my clothes off, too... âª


Schmidt?

Be right there.

I think we overdid it.

I can't see!

I'm right here... No!

(grunts)

Schmidt, I want to make love!

(whispering)

I got to go.

It's sex.

I'm coming, Elizabeth!

(laughter)

Look, when we were dating, I was very limited as to what we could do sexually.

It wasn't until the Iraqi w*r that I realized a guy could even be on top.

But that's all different now.

Now I have the Archduke.

Schmidt, have you ever considered not using lube and some giant sex toy, and just being with her?

Plain Janeing it?

Yeah, okay.

Well, I know for a fact that I can't win this thing,

because my story was... beautiful.

BOTH Aw.

NICK No, your story was not beautiful.

Nick's dad took us on a business trip to New York, right?

And he said that we could do whatever we wanted.

(chuckles)

And we did.

(chuckles)

Oh, man.

They're all on the Titanic.

How does this movie end?

(chuckles)

I can't believe I never seen it before, man.

It's the best.

You're mom's the best...

(laughing)

at having boobs.

Shut up, stupid.

I'm just kidding, man.

(giggles)

(chuckles)

NICK Don't. Don't.

Hey.

I didn't bring you two dummies all the way to New York so you can park your cans on the couch, watch TV and flick each other's Bics.

Hey, Dad, last night, somebody broke in and ordered a p*rn movie, so there's a mistake on the bill.

(both chuckling)

Yeah, okay, you can tell that to the Marines.

Meanwhile...

I have a little surprise for you boys.

Oh, cool.

Ladies?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no.

Wait, what? You lost

your virginity to prost*tute?

No, they were businesswomen.

Who could dance sexy.

Winston, % they were prost*tute.

Dude, no.

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

We work in the finance markets.

We work in the finance markets?

I'm Mysteria.

This is Octopussy.

Your name's Octopussy?

Absolutely.

Thank you, guys, for coming.

We're very wealthy.

(both laughing)

Winston, listen to their names.

They sound like pros.

She was a nurse.

Dude, her nurse hat was in her purse.

Would you listen to yourself?!

âª âª

Uhhuh.

Honey, why are you sweating so much?

You should drink something.

Thank you for the offer,

Ms. Octopussy, but II don't drink.

I prefer to be drunk on life.

Hold that for me?

Sure.

Thank you.

Perhaps I'll try some.

âª So she told me to come over and I took that trip âª
âª And then she pulled out... âª

Very interesting.

Uh, uh, uh.

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

I'm gonna do it to you.

You're gonna do what to me?

(crying)

I don't know.

Are you crying?

Please, excuse me, but I had to lay off a lot of really good men today at work.

What's wrong with your friend?

He's a virgin.

Aren't you a virgin, too?

Just my penis, baby.

Just my penis.

WINSTON So Mysteria and I made love that night.

For ten beautiful seconds.

So, what do you do for a living?

(snickers)

And it was good.

Nick, I can't believe you lost your virginity to Octopussy.

I couldn't go through with it.

It's 'cause the boy had no game.

He couldn't close.

Okay, you don't need game.

They were prost*tute.

My dad told me.

PopPop told you? When?

Nicky, you here?

Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

What are you doing?

If I'm being totally honest, I've had some alcoholic beverages tonight.

Well, to be totally honest with you, so have I.

How do you think I got through Annie?

Geez, that was rough.

What happened here?

I'm sorry, Dad.

I couldn't make love to Ms. Octopussy tonight.

It's too dangerous, and I was afraid the FBI was gonna track me down or a paper trail.

You think too much.

You think too much about everything.

When I was your age, my dad got a girl for me, too.

I mean, this is almost a Miller family tradition.

You should have seen her boobs.

They were great.

Real pointy, just like I like 'em.

Gross.

Listen, Nicky, you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.

I just want to make sure that you don't miss out on the things in life that are happening when you're not thinking.

Because, believe you me,

those... are the best things in life.

I think I really like drinking.

Well, that's great.

That's wonderful. That's good.

That's a great start.

It's really fun.

It makes me feel good.

Good.

(chuckles)

Uh...

Don't tell Winston about the girls.

You know,

that they're... pros.

Yeah, I won't. I don't want to break his heart, you know?

Okay.

I mean, you can tell him, but just...

wait, you know?

Maybe after I'm gone.

I'll tell him when you're d*ad.

So it's time you should know.

Mysteria...

On the bright side, looks like you won the contest.

Actually...

Jess, look at him.

Let him have this.

Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston.

I just can't let you win this.

My story...

involves...

m*rder.

(laughs)

Was Mysteria even her real name?

No.

So I'd just moved to L.A. to be with Cece, and we went out to some bar.

Do you remember where that was?

No.

How did I get this far without having sex?

In three years,

I'm gonna be .

I can't rent my first car as a virgin.

They'll know.

Okay. What about those guys over there?

Mega beer!

Party!

Pour beer at the same time.

Yeah!

They are definitely single.

Yeah!

I mean, k*ll me.

Oh, my God.

It was the guy from prom night.

It was fate.

Want to get out of here?

(chuckles)

Like, to do it?

(chuckles)

Yeah. I'd be down with that.

Yes.

Um, but I'm kind of living

out of my car right now.

Damn it.

Yeah.

And I'm sleeping on my friend's couch.

Do you like DVDs?

Do you sell cookies?

Not a cookie bar.

I have an idea.

(kissing sounds)

Hey, uh, I'm kind of on a lot of antidepressants right now, so this may kind of take a while.

The only antidepressants you need are in my pants.

Uh, it's really a medical issue.

I'm so sorry.

That was really uncool.

And... take as much time as you need.

So, two hours later...

still nothing.

It was like a wind sock on a windless day.

Give me an update, brother.

How's your wang?

(crying)

Do you have, like, an...

Is there, like, an

angle you could...

like... I mean...

It's just... it's so much easier when it's, like, in the shower, you know, and you're by yourself and you don't...

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

And there's no one with you.

Well, what can I do to help? Listen, why don't we try our luck on the other side of the castle, okay?

(muffled grunting)

JESS Oh, my God!

(groans)

We're stuck.

MAN Hey, uh, don't really know why, but...

ready now.

NICK Okay, getting worse.

SCHMIDT We were promised m*rder.

CECE

She's not done.

Hey...

hey, kids. Could one of you go get a grownup?

We're doing some grownup things over here.

MAN Happy birth... Happy birthday.

JESS Happy birthday.

(siren wails, f*re truck horn blasts)

Sir, um, we tried to make love on the bench, but, uh, there was a man there.

Oh, he's still there.

He must have been very tired.

He slept through all those sirens.

This man's d*ad.

What?!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

(sobbing) I'm stuck!

Officer, I... it was very dark, and I did not see the Kn*fe.

There's so much death in the world.

Seriously, dude, take your pills! I'm sick of you.

I'm sick of you!

I'm sick of you!

MAN Important reminder...

don't move.

(sobbing)

I think I might be gay!

Yeah.

(sobbing)

Oh, my God.

Teddy's gay?

I knew it. Yes.

That wasn't Teddy.

That was Teddy.

NICK What?

âª You try to give away a keeper or keep me âª
âª 'Cause you know you're just so scared to lose âª
âª And you say... âª

I'm Teddy.

Teddy Sherman.

âª Stay... âª

Take me home, Teddy.

Take me home.

(engine revving)

(groans)

I'm sick of firemen always winning.

Well, you know, I'd just waited so long, and Teddy took me by surprise.

It was the heat of the moment.

I didn't have to think about it.

SCHMIDT Well, who wins?

I think we're all losers.

Are you kidding me, Jess?

You had passionate sex with a fireman, all right?

I had sex with a hooker.

Well, I mean, unless... Are you guys sure she was a hooker?

(overlapping chatter)

NICK Jess, wait.

So, is he, like, the kind of fireman that hangs back and takes care of the dog?

No, he, like,

straight up fought fires.

That's awful to hear.

You know,

you never actually told me how you lost yours.

Alison Daniels.

On a towel in the woods.

I cried.

She kept her bra on.

It was nice.

(cell phone ringing)

Oh.

I have to go meet Teddy.

I should go.

What do you think?

âª âª

What are you doing?

(gasps)

Let's not think about it.

I've got three hours till the redeye.

Let's do this.

Um...

Babe, you know I don't do well under pressure.

Well, just distract yourself. Um...

here, turn on the TV.

âª I've been trying to hide, we held our breath âª
âª To see our names are written... âª

Look, we're gonna be married in, like, two days.

Should we maybe, you know, try it once?

Not yet.

(chuckles)

âª Yes, since we found out âª
âª Since we found out âª
âª That anything could happen âª
âª Anything could happen âª
âª Anything could happen âª
âª Anything could happen âª
âª Anything could happen âª
âª Anything could... âª

What is that?

It's a super intense German personal power massager.

But I don't think we need it.

Hey. You know...

since you...

came all this way with that box...

We'll have to take the batteries out of the smoke detector.

(panting)

(sighs, chuckles)

(sighs)

(chuckles)

BOTH (laughing)

Oh, boy.

JESS (Ã  la ScoobyScoobyDoo)

Ruhroh.

Oh, my God! What is that?

I don't want to hear it, okay? My mother sent it to me.

It belonged to my father.

We have the same exact butt.

What are you wearing?

What are you wearing?

I'm dressed for my Booty Burn Boot Camp class. I know what you're thinking.

It's not because I need it. I go to inspire the others.

Please take that thing off. You look like a homeless pencil.

I will not take it off. I have a pass.

A pass? What kind of pass?

A d*ad Dad Pass.

Which means I can do what I want when I want and no one can say anything about it.

Like right now, I want to tap dance, and you, Jess, you cannot tell me that this isn't tap.

Nick, that's just not tap!

My dad d*ed!

I'm sorry. It's just not.

Hey, y'all. Look at these fancy invites.

Do you think it's to a gala event? I've always wanted to go to a gala event.

Yeah.

What the hell are you wearing?

d*ad Dad Pass.

Oh, my God! It's Cece's wedding.

Wait a minute.

It's in three weeks?

She didn't tell me it was in three weeks.

Cece didn't give me a plus-one. How dare she not give me a plus-one.

You can't invite an ex to a wedding and not give him the dignity of consolation sex. Girl better recognize.

Schmidty gonna go get his plus-one.

Ew, Nick, what are you doing?

d*ad Dad Pass.

âª Hey, girl

âª What you doing?

âª Hey, girl

âª Where you going?

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

I have not technically been asked to be maid of honor, but I am throwing Cece's surprise bachelorette party here tonight, and the only males invited are strippers, so oil up or get out, guys.

Seriously though, this is a really big deal for her.

Some girls plan their weddings, Cece planned her bachelorette party.

I want to have the dirtiest bachelorette party of all time.

Then you better have it in a pigpen.

No, I mean I want strippers and a mechanical bull and balloons in the shape of ding dongs, and I want to wear the kind of underwear that goes between your cheeks.

I'm also gonna need your help.

Oh, God. We could've left.

See. You know what?

We had ample opportunity to leave.

I saw it coming miles away and did nothing. Me, too.

No. I just need you to kidnap Shivrang so I can get Cece alone.

Roughhouse him a little bit, drop him off in the desert till he don't breathe no more?

What?!

I'm so happy you guys could come help.

All the way from India.

Aw, look at all the ladies bonding.

This is so exciting. You know, Grandmother and Ankita Auntie just couldn't wait to meet you.

Yeah...

Just a little overwhelmed.

I'm gonna take a...

I know.

Wait, listen.

Look, babe. Just think.

When all of this madness is over, you and I will finally get to, you know...

What are you doing?

Freaking me out.

You know, make love.

Which I am personally looking forward to greatly.

And we'll already be married forever.

I'll-I'll get it.

Hello... Shivrang? What are you doing here?

I, uh... You stole my question.

Hi. How are you doing? My invitation didn't have a plus-one.

If this is a mistake, I would just like an apology for the pain that you've caused me.

Also reimbursement for all travel expenses.

Not a mistake. There's no plus-one.

Who is this?

I'm GÃ©rard Depardieu.

Do you think I am, lady? I'm Schmidt.

Get in my room right now, Schmidt. Move.

I'm going to your room right now.

Hey, you listen to me. That is my future family, okay?

You cannot speak like that in front of them.

And, no, you cannot have a plus-one.

This wedding has a budget.

Plus-ones are for spouses and serious partners only.

So you just assume that I won't have a serious partner by then?

I know for a fact you won't, okay? You're not a relationship guy, and that is fine.

I can do anything I put my mind to.

I once figured out Alyssa Milano's phone number just by randomly choosing numbers.

Every girl that I've ever slept with wants to be my girlfriend. It's just the way that it is.

If you have a real girlfriend by the time of the wedding, I will happily give you a plus-one.

Challenge accepted.

Not a challenge. - Time to go make some dreams come true.

I...

Hey, ladies.

I just want to thank you all for coming on such short notice for Cece's last night of freedom.

Hi, models.

Hi. - Hi. - I'm a lawyer.

Hi.

I'm Sadie.

I'm a lesbian.

Hey. - Hi. - Hi, lesbian.

I'm 39 weeks large right now.

I can't stand for more than 60 seconds but just wanted to say I'm-I'm so excited to be raging with you all.

So bring on the cranberry juice, right?

I need this.

It's really weird.

You're acting really weird.

So many models.

I know. I know.

So many.

You can look. Don't touch.

One more thing? I am a doctor if anyone's got any areas they want... looked at.

I'm fine to take a peek. That's too much.

Don't make me call your wife.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Cece's here. Everybody assume surprise positions!

She's coming. Cece'soming.

I don't get what's happening.

I'm just gonna run upstairs and quickly grab a CD from Jess.

I'll come, too.

That's okay. I... I'll be really fast.

I want to see what your friends are like.

Have fun.

Okay.

It's gonna be great. It's just Jess.

Okay.

Bye.

I-I'll be right here.

Hey.

Whoa.

Hey, Nick. Sorry, I thought you were Jane Lynch.

Jane Lynch. Nice... nice wheels, man.

Yeah, thank you.

I'm a bit of a car man myself. Well, you know I decided to... Right on. - Good for you.

Too far!

Winston! Oh, take the car. Take the car.

I'm gonna b*at your ass with an athletic stick, boy!

Winston! Winston!

Jess said to kidnap him, so that's what I'm doing.

It's a figure of speech, you idiot.

You nervous?

Uh-huh.

Surprise!

Surprise!

It's your bachelorette party!

Jess, I...

Love it? I know.

Complete with your favorite game, Pin the Dong on the Shivrang!

Pin the dong! Pin the dong!

Oh. Hello.

Oh.

Um, Jess, this is Ankita-ji, Shivrang's aunt all the way from India.

Hello.

Ankita-ji, this is Jess, my non-blood related best friend.

Welcome... to California.

May I please use your restroom?

I need to wash my hands.

Yes, of course. It's down the hall. Um, also there's a very sexually aggressive message on the mirror and I apologize for that.

Pin the dong.

Pin it. - I can't.

Come on, Cece. Get the bull's-eye.

I haven't seen Shivrang's penis.

Oh.

It's that small?

You still know where it goes though.

It just h*t me. I'm about to commit the rest of my life to a man that I have never seen naked.

Cece, chances are he has, like, a standard garden-variety penis.

And if we're all really honest with ourselves, isn't it all about the gonads?

Am I right, ladies?

No. - No.

I'm trying to make her feel better.

And Ankita cannot hear anything about this, all right?

She will not understand. You guys have to promise to keep it G-rated tonight.

Cece, you've dreamt of this party your whole life.

I wouldn't want to change it.

No.

Really?

I can't.

Really?

I can't.

Okay.

Cece, what if it looks like an old carrot?

What if it's curly?

Oh, God.

If he's using it right, no one's seeing his penis.

Okay, I'm gonna fix this.

So, if Jess is throwing Cece a surprise bachelorette party, does that make this my surprise bachelor party?

You shut that pretty mouth of yours, Romeo, before I fill it with f*re!

Hey, you got to ease up, Winston.

I got to go.

Oh, no, no, no. No, don't.

I got a call. - Please.

I need a picture of Shivrang's penis.

d*ad Dad Pass! New topic!

Cece's really freaking out.

She hasn't seen his penis.

For the love of God, d*ad Dad Pass.

And I need it to scale, so please put, like, a nickel or a big toe or a golf pencil in there for reference.

It's not gonna happen!

One picture and you can come home.

Give me 20 minutes.

If you want to end this, we need to get a photo of Shivrang's penis.

There it is.

Cool.

Hey, Shivrang! We're liars, man!

We are throwing you a good old-fashioned American bachelor party!

Whoops!

Bachelor party! Yeah!

Whoa! Whoa Hey! What are you...

What is wrong with you?!

âª Come on, come on

âª Yeah... âª

I know.

Why don't we talk about some of the things that we love about Shivrang?

I'll start. Um...

he has really good taste in magazines.

This sucks!

Boring!

So lame. - Jess, let's put in the slideshow that you made for Cece.

No, I don't think that's a good idea.

Yes! Time for p*rn cinema.

No!

Oh, my God, no!

Oh...

Oh, my God. No. Guys, guys...

How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?

Well, spoiler alert:

Women are liars.

Yeah. Yeah.

They're supposed to want commitment, right?

But then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.

I know this is awkward because we slept together, and I never returned any of your phone calls, so this might come as a shock to you, but... will you be my girlfriend?

Oh, God.

I thought you had herpes.

But no to the girlfriend, you dick.

Do you remember two years ago when we were watching coverage of the BP oil spill and doing it during the commercials and then you asked me if I wanted a serious relationship and I laughed in your face?

Well, my new answer... is yes.

Be my girlfriend!

What's that all about?

Cream cheese in bulk?

I mean, it's possible that Cece's right.

I mean, maybe I'm just not a serious relationship kind of guy.

What are you talking about?

You dated Elizabeth for, like...

for years.

Yeah.

Elizabeth?

Yeah, but Elizabeth doesn't count.

She was during my "Big Guy" period.

So you like the foot rub? Softer? Harder?

That's perfect, Big Guy.

Look at all these little toes.

All my little toesies feel so good when you rub 'em, though.

This little... this little one went to market.

If Elizabeth doesn't count, then why is it seared into my brain forever?

You were awfully salty about that.

She counts.

We need to make Cece jealous, and I don't think that's the route we want to take.

Then go to the wedding alone.

Oh.

Well, then, go with Elizabeth.

Great idea, Winston. I'm gonna ask Elizabeth.

Yeah. You were of no help to me, Nick.

That's what... my whole thing about the whole thing with Elizabeth was that I was also suggesting...

Thanks, guys.


You're an idiot, dude.

You're the worst. You guys were...

How did you know we were here?

Oh! Oh, I just couldn't decide.

Your country's refusal to embrace Robbie Williams will forever baffle me.

Well, I got to say, we're really glad you're back at the table with us, Shivrang.

Shivrung.

Let's play a classic bachelor party game right now.

Mm-hmm, all right.

I'm gonna take a photo of my junk.

Oh, no, you're not.

Yeah, I am. 'Cause this is what we do in America, Shivrang. - What?

Don't think that's much of a competition... - Oh...

I work here.

It doesn't matter.

They're not gonna f*re me.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

Okay. Yup.

Just...

That is my junk in a photo. Okay.

It's your turn, Shivrang. Take a photo of your junk.

Oh, no. No, thanks.

We're all doing it.

No, it's not... Absolutely not.

I'm begging you. - But I will get us another round of drinks.

Take the photo...

Take the picture, Shivrang.

Who fancies a shandy?

What the hell is that?

It's a drink.

Two for you guys coming right up.

Cece actually designed that toilet.

Cece was a volunteer nurse, and, um...

No bottoms?

You know, what-what happens in Orlando stays in Orlando.

Nadia, seriously, turn it off.

Cece, is this how you like to spend time with your friends?

Is this the kind of wife you want to be?

No, no. It's not at all, okay?

I didn't even know this party was happening.

It was a surprise.

I promise you, this is so not me.

I didn't want any of it.

Cece, you wanted a bachelorette party ever since I've known you.

Why do you have to pretend to be somebody you're not?

What are you saying? - I'm just saying, this is all moving really, really fast, and maybe you need to get to know Shivrang a little bit more, and maybe you need to slow this down so he can get to know you.

I'm getting married in three weeks.

Are you saying that I shouldn't get married in three weeks?

No. I'm just saying that maybe you should...

I knew it! I knew it!

You have been against this wedding from the beginning.

Fine! I don't think you should marry Shivrang if it means you have to change who you are.

Yeah, well, I don't need to take relationship advice from a girl who's in the middle of a seventh grade debacle with a boy across the hall!

Oh! - "Oh, I'm a single adult, and I kissed another

"single adult. What's gonna happen?

"Does Nick like me?

"I better go pick out a party dress.

I wear pajama sets!"

You question my pajamas, you make me question our entire friendship.

Let's say it, Jess! - You never asked me to be your maid of honor.

It's awful hot in here.

Who wants to cool down with a double scoop of Alfredo?

Not now, Alfredo!

Seriously?

âª I'll take you to the candy shop âª
âª I'll let you lick the lollipop âª
âª Go ahead, girl, don't you stop âª
âª Keep going till you h*t the spot. âª

Congratulations, Cece.

Well, chaps, I guess we'll just have to make our own.

But first, I have to use the bathroom.

See you in a minute. This is fun.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Yeah.

f*re...!

Oh!

Real f*re. This f*re is real.

f*re!

Whoa!

What are you doing? You were supposed to take the picture.

Aah! It's burning so fast!

Go put it out!

You... Oh!

Look, you guys are acting really, really peculiar.

What is going on?

What is going on... is that, uh...

recently I've been one-half orphaned.

I'm sorry.

My-my dad passed away.

We orphans, man!

And it would mean the world to us ... not so much ...

if, uh...

I miss Walt so much.

If we can get a photo of your penis.

Wait. What? I'm sor...

It would help with the grieving, it would just...

For Walt, man.

All right, all right, enough!

Okay.

We need a photo for... for Cece.

Cece? - Yeah. She's freaking out

'cause she's never seen you naked.

And she's afraid it looks all funky.

So just show us that it looks regular, and we all go home.

She's freaking out?

Look, guys, I've-I've got to go.

I have... I have to talk to her.

Oh, you're... We're all in the same car. Ugh!

You know, I'm gonna take care of this.

How are you gonna take of this?

Crop, rotate, rotate... and send.

What are you doing?

I mean, this.

I just send a picture of your penis to Jess... - No!

...and told her it was Shivrang's.

No!

So now, we good.

You did not just do that.

Oh.

Shivrang.

What, Shivrang? Shivrang, what?

What?

No, nothing. It's nothing. Don't.

Oh, my God.

"Shivrang's Shiv"?

You got your idiot roommates to kidnap my fiancÃ© to take a picture of his penis?

Well, you were freaking out!

Well, see... Three more weeks of winter.

Oh, my God.

What are you doing?

Get out!

Sorry. I'm so sorry. I immediately regret that.

Show me!

Okay.

You are scared because you haven't seen your future husband's manhood?

Where I come from, women cry about this for days.

This is real.

This is not a dream.

Look, I've kept off the weight.

You knew me when action sandals were my necessary footwear.

What do you want? - Why do you think I want something?

Because I dated you for four years.

I know when you want something. What do you want?

I would like to take you to a wedding, because I miss you so much...

No, I can't take you seriously when you're wearing such tight pants.

Get to the point.

Okay, look, my model ex-girlfriend is getting married to some small little Indian man who I just don't understand.

Okay, and I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend so she gets very sad, and then, breaks off the wedding, and then, runs away with me.

No. Not a chance.

No?

Wait, wait, wait, please.

Elizabeth?

I'm only gonna say this once.

You were the greatest boyfriend.

I loved Big Guy.

But then, you lost weight, and you got mean.

You stopped listening to me.

You changed completely.

You stopped paying for my dinner.

Elizabeth, to be fair, at that point, you were eating the lion's share of the food.

And you were sitting there eating one basil leaf, looking like an idiot panda bear.

Well...

Look, I loved Big Guy with all my heart.

But I have no interest in helping the guy who's standing in front of me now.

I hate your hair.

And I looked, and I looked, and I couldn't find it. Where is it?

And then, I realized, uh-oh.

That is not his leg.

Oh, hey, uh, Jess, uh, please tell me...

Hey... that nobody's looked at your photos in your phone.

Um... you're too late.

Cece looked at it.

We all looked at it.

Prize hog, Shivrang.

Yeah...

I'm so sorry they made you do it.

Oh, it's okay.

Actually, it wasn't mine.

What?! - What?!

Whose was it?

It was mine.

What?! No way!

Yeah, it was, uh... Those were my privates.

Are you serious?

I'm serious. Give me my phone. I want it back now.

I have a d*ad Dad Pass. I have a d*ad Dad Pass!

No! No! It's my property!

What is going on here?

And why is Alfredo crying in the elevator?

Hello, you.

What's up, Nadia?

It's just... it's just that there's so much we don't know about each other, and I...

It's fine. That's it. I'm showing it to you.

I'm showing you my software.

No, no, no! No, no!

It's called hardware, Jack.

Yeah.

If it run, I catch it.

I mean, I don't want to see it. I do. Okay.

But not-not... not here.

I'm sorry.

It's just, you know, I-I...

Sometimes it feels like we're just moving so fast, and I feel crazy that we're just...

jumping in blindly.

But maybe that's what makes this special.

It's just a real leap of faith, Shivrang.

Yeah, uh, but look, the first thing that you need to know about me is that it's actually pronounced Shivrung.

I don't know how to pronounce your name?! - No, no.

You were just so pretty, I didn't want to correct you.

But look, the most important thing is that I am gonna do my best to make you the happiest woman on the face of the earth.

Shavvy's getting nasty.

Shavvy a dog.

Shavvy?

We're friends now.

d*ad Dad Pass.

Hey.

Look, Cece...

I just wanted to say that if I was ever selfish in our relationship...

What do you mean, "if," and what do you mean, "relationship"?

That's fair. Um...

if I was...

I sincerely apologize.

So, challenge unaccepted. I don't want a plus-one.

I'm really happy for you.

Thank you.

Good night, Schmidt.

Schmidty out.

Hey.

Hey.

I just want to say, um, I'm really sorry about...

No. I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

And there's, uh...

There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

It's not traditional in Indian weddings to have a maid of honor, but...

I would really love it if you would be mine.

Yeah. I mean, I don't know...

What?!

Yes! Oh, my God, thank you so much for asking me!

I paid. All yours, no judgments.

Why'd you come back, Schmidt?

The Big Guy is...

Well, he's still somewhere inside this... perfect body.

He needs you to coax him out a little bit.

Please tell him what to do next.

Eat the pizza.

Eat all the pizza...

while I watch... right now.

Okay.

Oh. It's so greasy.

So many carbs.

Hey guys... Oh boy.

Welcome home, melted cheese.

Oh.

I don't even know what pepperoni's made of.

It's so good.

Is that your happy dance, big boy?

I love it.

Oh, there he is.

Yup.

There's my big guy.

It's like waking up from a bad salad dream.

âª Big guy in the house.

Watching TV ... cool.

Cool.

Where do you think you're going? That charger belongs to all of us.

Nowhere.

Oh, really?

Because it looks like you're going to your room to charge when it's not your turn.

You know the rules, dumb-dumb.

Charger stays in a neutral room.

Why do we only have one charger anyway?

It was supposed to bring us closer together.

Hey, look, another charger.

Take him! - Get him!

Get down!

You guys get him started, I'll finish him off.

Just... so many dude butts.

Watch my face, man. That's my face.

Watch my face. Hey, that's the moneymaker.

No, I'm gonna stop him, I'm gonna stop...

Get... No!

You are terrible at this.

Oh, you can't outrun the Jewish.

That was stupid.

They are such idiots.

I don't know why I do this.

The charger doesn't even fit on my phone.

I have, like, six chargers in my room.

I just do this for fun.

It's funny.

Well, here we are by ourselves.

What should we do?

Uh, definitely not make out.

Definitely not.

Your hand's on my boob.

Yeah.

And it's weird.

Maybe it's less weird because I know that it's weird ... I'm calling it out.

Doesn't make it less weird.

Right on.

So you're an upper-boob guy.

That's the most underrated part of the boob.

It's what I've always said.

Can I ask you a question?

Please.

What's going on here?

Yeah.

What are we...?

We, us?

What are we doing? Yeah.

We are roommates, who have made out a couple of times, and are attracted to each other.

Mm-hmm.

And really good friends.

Yeah.

And sometimes genuinely kind of hate each other.

And sometimes...

touch each other's boobs.

Little bit better...

Not helping.

Little bit worse?

Yeah.

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

New Girl S02E21

First Date Would you describe this as a sexual act?

I would describe that as the pledge of allegiance, which can be sexual. Why?

Because this is what I got from Nick.

Just out of the blue. No reason.

Our relationship's so confusing.

But this is Nick we're talking about.

He's never gonna tell me how he feels.

It's always gonna be weird.

And I have to stop expecting for it to...

change. What?

You realize your hand is still on your boob, right?

I can't explain it, it's...

it's, like, really calming me down.

I mean, the sexual tension has been off the charts.

It's like the wild west.

No laws.

Whiskey for a nickel.

Whores caked in mud.

I don't know what to do.

You're always there when I need you, Tran.

Thank you.

I'm glad you got no life.

I'm joking. Would you settle down?

My father just d*ed.

I don't know, life's short, huh?

It just kind of...

I got to start doing things, Tran.

Making moves, grown-up moves.

I don't know, I want things. I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.

What's my move with Jess?

What would you do?

Of course you would, you dirty dog.

Well, in reality, Tran, what would do if you were me?

A date?

What if that's not what she wants?

What if she... oh!

What if she...?

All right, you're right ... no second-guessing.

I got to be confident, I've got to be clear.

Women like that.

All right, I just got to say...

Jessica, you are a beautiful woman, and my life has not been the same since I met you.

And it would mean the world to me if you would, uh...

go on a date with me.

Hey, Nick.

Jess...ica.

Dirty J, Dr. day, my toilet sister.

If so, food.

You want to get food later?

I'm gonna get dressed now.

Okay, bye.

Did you put the charger the bathroom?

The most neutral room in the loft.

Yeah, well, I moved it to the kitchen.

The kitchen?

Hey, guys.

Nick, what's more neutral?

The awesome bathroom or the stupid, stupid kitchen?

I have a lot of thoughts on this, but first, Schmidt, I have a favor.

It's about my clothes.

Burn them, burn them all.

No, no, no, no, no, I have a date tonight, and, you know, there's a lot of women who sleep with you, and I can't figure out why, so maybe it's about clothes, and maybe...

Are you asking me if I'll help you pick out clothing so you can seduce a woman?

I was.

I don't know. It's only all I've been wanting for the past ten years, Nick.

Yes, that is how you wrap a son of a bitch in wool.

Now, if somebody asks you who you're wearing tonight, what do you say? Do it, bro.

I don't want to do that.

I don't want to do that.

Do it.

I'm wearing Schmidt. Yeah.

Yeah, you are.

And neckscape by Winston.

Oh... whoa, who is that handsome devil?

Okay, now, here's some things you want to hide about yourself on tonight's date, okay?

Definitely, yeah.

That you're cheap, you're a heavy drinker, you're broke and you have a problem with anger.

Your car is horrible.

So go ahead and take my new Foscapay.

What's a Foscapay?

Uh, Ford Escape.

I'm still work-shopping nicknames.

By the way, who's the girl?

Who's the girl?

Who's the girl? Yeah.

Uh, what's her name?

It's, uh, yeah, it's, uh...

Her name is, uh, obviously Yolanda.

Uh... her last name is Winston.

I should go.

Oh, I love latino girls.

Yolanda Winston.

Schmidt, that's a fake name.

Yeah, but why would he lie about...

Oh, my God.

Nick is a male escort.

Jess...

Probably not a... Yeah.

Jess, man.

Do you realize what it means if Jess and Nick become a couple?

Nick is our glue, man. You know, without him, it just doesn't work ... it never has.

See what I mean? He's awesome, man.

This is my, one of my best friends, too.

I'm gonna use the bathroom.

Nick...

Nick...

All of our stories start and end with Nick.

What if Nick decides he's gonna leave us?

Well, you know what we have to do, right?

We're gonna track Jess down and k*ll her with this Kn*fe.

We have to sabotage the date.

Or we do your thing.

Let's do your thing.

Hey, Jess.

Hey.

What are you doing over there by the hot dogs?

You gave me the address, I just assumed we were eating at the hot dog stand.

No...

Why are you wearing a suit?

Did you just apply for a loan or something?

No, I'm, uh...

I'm wearing Schmidt.

You're wear... you're wearing what?

I'm wearing Schmidt, uh...

Winston shaved my face.

Weird.

Well, come on, let's get some dinner.

Come on, I got a reservation.

Come on.

What?

Hi, there, sir. Afraid, uh, you apparently didn't see the crosswalk was over there.

Oh, let's not sweat the small stuff, officer. I'm walking across the street.

Afraid I'm gonna have to write you up for jaywalking. - Stay calm, make tiny fists with your toes.

I'm really sorry about this.

Jess, I'm not upset.

This man is merely doing his job.

You were right, I was wrong.

Here you go, sir. Thank you, officer.

$340?!

Yeah, I know it's a lot. They raised it last year, I think.

Have a good night, ma'am.

All right, just scram.

You too, sir.

Dinner?

Okay.

Okay.

After you.

Thank you.

Okay.

Very lovely.

What an establishment.

It's my favorite in the city.

Right on time.

Oh...

Keep it coming.

Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?

What's on your mind?

Well, I'm just asking...

if this is a date.

What do you mean, "is this a date?"

I'm just... I'm asking you if this is a date.

It seems like a date.

You've been thinking it's a date this whole time?

I'm just asking you.

How embarrassing for you.

No, for me, it's just hanging out in a suit, getting champagne with my friend.

I think we're ready to order.

I have an idea ... I'm gonna have the bartender send over two tropical cocktails.

Jess will be all,

"Why, thank you."

Nick will be all, "Grandpa didn't get a face full of Japanese b*ll*ts just so you could drink a melted popsicle."

Or...

we could break into a zoo, steal a bear, then we sh**t that bear full of Hep C, and then we release that bear in the restaurant right when they order dessert.

Winston, you're terrible at pranks.

I get that.

You don't think just a bear alone in a restaurant is enough?

You know who would know what to do?

I do know who would know what to do.

Nick.

Nick.

We can't call him, right?

Ooh.

They have, uh, Brussels sprouts with pancetta.

That's a fancy name for bacon.

Hold the Brussels sprouts. Am I right?

Everybody loves bacon, Jess ... New topic.

You know, um...

If this were a date...

Yeah, but it wasn't, Jess...

But, I mean, if it were...

It wasn't a...

And it's probably good because your ex-boyfriend just walked into the restaurant.

Who?

The only man we both loved.

Russell.

Hey.

Hi.

Hi, so this is why you dumped me, huh?

Oh, well...

No...

Just kidding. I'm glad to see this is finally happening.

Nothing's happening, so...

Nothing's happening because I was never told it was happening, so if a happening happens and you don't know that it happened, did it happen, you know?

Right on.

Um, hey, enjoy my lucky table.

I'm Brandy.

Okay.

You know what?

Can we just forget about this date, or not-date, and...

Maybe start over and go get a drink at the bar as friends?

Drinking to forget?

That's my sweet spot.

Let's do that.

Okay.

These clothes are so uncomfortable.

Glad to get it off. In there.

You ready to drink with a friend?

I am, Jess.

Yes.

Let's do this.

Why isn't the crosswalk here?

Just let it out.

Just let it out.

This is where people want to cross, sir.

We don't need our table.

We're sitting at the bar. Not a date.

Your table's all yours ... not on a date.

I think we're doing too much brainstorming and not enough good old-fashioned remembering.

What's the worst thing that you've ever experienced on a date?

âª I will be your father figure

âª put your tiny hand in mine

âª I will be your preacher teacher âª
âª Anything you have in mind

âª I will be your father figure

âª I have had enough of crime

âª I will be the one who loves you âª
âª Till the end of time.

Outside Dave, my friend Winston here holds in his hands the lyrics to sir George Michael's

"Father Figure."

I'm familiar.

What's it gonna take for you to lose the shirt and go ruin a date for us?

We're willing to pay you handsomely.

Four million U.S. dollars and a trip to wine country.

I don't have $4 million.

All right, give him that.

I'll tell you what.

25 minutes of TV time and two home-cooked sandwiches.

One home-cooked sandwich.

Deal.

Yeah, deal.

Okay, Outside Dave.

Make yourself at home here on the couch, and I'll get started on those sandwiches...

To the laboratory!

Diversion!

Two urinals?

I'm rich!

You both have jobs.

Get another charger.

I love those guys, but they're idiots.

They are idiots.

They are so dumb.

To their credit, they don't go around randomly grabbing each other's boobs.

That we know of.

Randomly? Oh, no way.

You put it out there, Jess.

What?

Yes, you do.

I do not put it out there.

"Hey, Nick, will you help me open this jar?"

What?

Yes.

I can't open the jar.

"How do you restart the Internet?"

That's just me suffering through life.

You have to stop, because it's ridiculously hot.

Okay?

It's... hard for me to deal with,

'cause it's too hot.

All right, fine.

Then you have to stop gargling your beer.

That's a turn-on?

It's hot.

That is so weird, that that's a turn-on.

You're like...

Might as well be in, like, a...

like a hose, spraying you down.

You are out of your mind.

Hey.

Do you want to get some dinner?

Like a...

like a date?

Yeah. Let's...

Okay.

Yes! Let's do it!

We're going on a date!

Yes!

Yes!

Come on, guys.

Guys, so sorry. Curveball.

We need the table back.

We are on a date.

We are on a date.

Amazing.

Hey, Marc, could you clear the table but leave the breadsticks?

Actually, don't clear the table,

'cause that looks good.

Could you clear the fish?

I don't want to be too forward, but...

whatever baby wants, baby gets.

Daddy's buying.

Well, look, you keep buying my drinks, I'll put out no matter what you say.

Ooh.

I guess the good ones

aren't all married or gay.

How many have we had?

Ooh!

Hey, Russell!

Nice to see you!

Date's going really well.

That's... that's great news.

Really, really nice to see you guys.

Yeah.

You two are...

really something.

"Really something."

What does that mean?

Hmm.

You know, we're having a great date.

Right?

Who cares what he thinks?

Who cares what he says?

I don't... agree.

Hey! Hey, Russell!

Hey!

Oh, God. Where's my car?

Hey, you said we were

"really something..." and we want to know what that means. - What does that mean?

Yeah.

This may come as a shock, but I have no opinion about you two.

Did you valet? God, that is classy.

You know what? You can't just tell two people that they're

"really something"

and just walk away.

Fine. You-you want to know what I meant?

Yes! - You live together and you had three dates tonight.

What's that?

I think you guys don't really know what you are to each other. Right?

Well, you're wrong. No, you're wrong. Yeah.

You are wrong, because we know what we are...

We do know... yeah. We know what we are.

Okay, this'll be fun.

Tell you what. Why don't you write it down?

Seriously.

Write down what you think this is.

Is this a relationship, a one-night stand, above the waist only?

No wrong answers.

You had two pens on you this whole time?

Well, sure.

That's the move right there.

You better believe it.

This is so much better than the gutter!

I'm calling the Police, I'm calling the D.A., I'm calling somebody.

Mmm, smells like ladies in here.

Damn it. My battery's d*ad.

Yeah, mine, too. Where is the charger?

Schmidt, you put the charger back in the bathroom?

I'm sorry, okay? I thought it was the neutralest room.

Three, two, one...zero!

Let's just go, Brandy.

Wait. No, no, no, no.

Don't go. Yeah, I got it, too. Me, too.

I got this, I got this.

There it is.

Okay. Figured it out.

Good. Great. - Great.

Okay.

Y-you know what? This wasn't such a good idea.

Maybe just forget I thought of it.

We're just gonna go. All right?

Yeah. Yeah.

It's best that way.

What did you write?

What did you write?

Russell, Russell, hey.

Russell, we have to get to the bottom of this.

Okay, move it, move it.

Excuse me, sir.

The crosswalk... geez.

Sorry.

Oh, my gosh.

Hair sauce!

Hair sauce? Oh, my God.

Mmm, feels like mud.

If he even looks at my pomade caddy, I will turn every hobo in the city against him.

I will poison every pie on every windowsill.

He doesn't steal pies from windowsills.

He is a real-life homeless person.

We need to call the cops.

Oh, I'm sorry, we can't. You know why?

Yeah, your phone's d*ad.

Because of you, Schmidt.

You want to know why I'd rather hang out with Nick?

Shh. What is that?

Time to cut the grass.

He's using my four-in-one groomer.

I'm going in there.

No! Schmidt! Absolutely not!

I'm going in there, man.

You hear that? Because that... that is not the fourth use.

There's no sanctioned fifth use!

Hey, Schmidt! Schmidt!

Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

He's using it for a fifth use!

Nick is gonna be home soon.

Okay? And then everything will be fine.

Nick will know what to do.

There's no time.

I'm going to the roof.

What are you... Schmidt, why are you going up...

Oh, my gosh, it's full of bugs.

Nick, I need to know how you feel.

What did you write on that card?

Well, what did you write on your card?

Let's say it at the same time, Okay.

on the count of three.

One, two, three...

Okay.

From now on, no funny business.

We do middle school dance rules.

Three feet on the floor, no body hugs.

Is that what you want?

Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah.

Okay.

Great.

You got it.

Wonderful.

Really?

I...

They've got a great squish to 'em.

I couldn't stop thinking about it.

Can't argue with you.

Wow, you can see my skin.

Oh, good lord.

Hot damn!

You got this.

You got this. Whoa.

What are you doing?

Stop moving.

Get off of me!

Hey, Schmidt!

He's got my leg!

Outside Dave, man, what's happening in there?

What are you d...

Schmidt!

Please! No!

He's real homeless!

No! Get off!

Come on. Come on!

If you're hurting him, I swear... oh, my...

It's shorts weather.

Everybody's gonna want to dance with you.

Well, you're going against the grain, you animal!

Is he shaving your legs?

Winston! Thank goodness! Catch me.

I got...

I was about to catch you, and then you just fell.

You just saved my life.

Anything, man, as long as you're okay.

You're okay?

Well, I don't know.

You break that whole thing down, there was...

A homeless man was just shaving my leg.

Yeah.

Hey, man.

Winston and Schmidt.

Winston and Schmidt.

All right!

Okay.

Yeah.

All right, man.

How long have the two of you been the best of friends?

Longer than we ever knew.

I will say it's hard to have a moment with you when there's a homeless dude dropping a deuce in our urinal.

We never actually ate, so...

Yeah, I know.

I'm getting a snack. I'm going to bed.

Can I have some of these?

Sure.

Jess, I can help you.

I got it.

I got it.

I don't even n... I don't even...

I don't even want...

JESS: Guess what! I got balloons. From a guy in a van. I love this neighborhood. I just love it.

Oh, what does that...?

"Me so horny." Very good.

"No credit, no problem!"

And "Happy 100th, Jane!"

I don't think she made it, but she lived a good life.

NICK (Shouts):

Shut up!

Who booby-trapped me?

(Phone ringing)

Stop! Shut up!

It's my mom.

Get off of me!

NICK: Yeah, Mom, hey.

(High-pitched): Nick's just mad

'cause that punk-ass balloon b*at his ass.

Hey, no huffing. Come on, guys.

(High-pitched):

Take these seriously, Winston.

I didn't buy the balloons to have you guys...

(High-pitched): If you do that one more time, I'm gonna break your faces in.

(High-pitched laughter)

Uh, my dad d*ed.

Yeah, I guess he had a heart att*ck.

I got to go back to, uh, Chicago and, uh, go to the funeral and everything.

(Sighs)

Well, are you guys gonna say anything or...

(High-pitched):

That's terrible, Nick.

Wow, we're so sorry.

SCHMIDT: If there's anything we can do, please.

Come here. Not Walt. Just...

Give me a hug.

Nick.

We love you.

Love you, Nick.

Stay strong.

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

JESS: So this is where Nick Miller grew up.

Well, except for the fall of '88

to spring of '89.

That was our van year.

JESS: I just want you to know I am here for you.

Okay.

I'm gonna be strong for you, man.

You know, I really did love Walt.

He was my dad, Winston.

Yeah, but, I mean, he loved me more than he loved you.

He told me that.

Yeah, he told me that, too, actually.

Sorry.

(Sighs)

You okay, Schmidt?

I didn't want to make this about me, but...

the airline lost my bag.

I wanted to look fantastic for your father's funeral.

Now I have nothing but the schmatta on my back.

NICK:

All right. Let's do this.

WINSTON: Uh, Jess, we should warn you.

Nick's family ... a little crazy.

MAN 1: It's called pop! MAN 2: Just call it soda.

It's soda, all right?

It's not! It's not!

Hey, Uncle Nicky. Hey, man.

No, it's called soda.

It's called pop!

It's called soda. It's called soda.

Why would you call it soda if it's pop?

You call your dad pop!

Hey.

It's Nick.

Hey. Nickels.

My brother Nick's back, guys.

My condolences, all right?

Hey, thanks for making it out.

Sorry about that. Your brother's being a douche.

Yeah. I'm not being a douche! I'm emotional!

Oh, God...

You've been a douche all day.

I mean, why?

I know. I know.

You been... you been crying a bunch, buddy?

No.

He'll get your shoulder all wet, too.

Hey, look, don't do the hair-pull. It's so intimate.

NICK: You okay? JAMIE: I'm not okay!

Jamie, here's what I need you to do: Grab a bunch of kids and teach them how to build a snowman outside.

I can't do that! I already did it already!

He put the carrot in the crotch.

Why'd you put the carrot in the crotch?

JAMIE: 'Cause they told me to! NICK: They're kids.

JAMIE: Those kids are cool! I wanted to hang out!

Don't trust cops.

Nicky!

Hey, Ma.

Oh.

Oh. I miss him, Nicky.

Yeah, I know, Ma.

That bastard was a saint.

A saint.

The bastard.

I know. Come here. Hey.

This is getting very personal. May...

Maybe none of us should go to the funeral.

The early buzz on this thing is that it's gonna be a real drag.

So what still needs to get done? We need to, uh, get the groceries, uh, plan the funeral, call the paper...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Did you say "plan the funeral"?

That's why you're here, Nicky.

You take care of everything.

I got the napkins!

Oh, that's so hot.

Great, Jamie.

Is Nick taking care of people?

Yeah, with Pop-Pop coming and going, Nick had to step up and be the man of the family.

Pretty much takes care of all of them.

Don't laugh when they call him responsible.

They don't know why that's hilarious.

Um... Oh... Hi, Mrs. Miller.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

If there's anything I can do to help, I...

Who are you?

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Jess. NICK: This is Jess, my new roommate.

Um, so nice to meet you.

I've told you about her.

Winnie and Fat Schmidt I know. Hey, boys.

JESS: I just wanted to say that I'm here and happy to do anything.

Is she a Spanish?

Um... I'm from Portland, Oregon.

Land of books.

(Chuckles)

Trailblazers.

Hmm.

Are you guys, uh...

Jamie, I'm begging you to shut up.

Your father always wanted to have a funeral just like Elvis had, so that's what we're gonna give him.

A funeral like Elvis had?

That means...

12 white limos and an Elvis impersonator...

NICK: Dad's gonna get the funeral you want him to have, okay?

So tell me what needs to get done, and I'll just do it.

Oh, the eulogy.

You...

you'll do the eulogy, right?

Oh...

I don't think I should do it.

You just say a bunch of nice stuff all in a row.

Do it, College. You got it.

Nick, you have to.

JESS: You should do it. JAMIE: Come on, Nicky.

You should do it. Do a good poem. Do one of your good ones.

BOBBY: Come on, man. You got to.

Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll, uh...

That's my boy.

He takes care of everything.

Hey.

Hey, Jess.

It's like a whole secret life for you.

You're not even looking at the numbers.

Aunt Ruthie used to call this the Iron Jew.

Wow.

(Chuckles)

Are you having time to process this?

Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out the level of Elvis impersonator we can afford.

Uh-huh.

And I think a white one's out of reach.

Is there anything I could do to help?

The eulogy.

Sorry?

Oh, that would be really helpful 'cause that's been getting in my way a little bit.

I didn't really know your dad except...

the one hour that I committed fraud with him.

That's all there is to know, really.

I think that's, you know, one task I think maybe is better if you...

Look, I've got to figure out an Elvis theme.

You know, Elvis-themed flowers and food and music all in a day.

I just... You asked if there was anything you could do, and there is.

Okay.

Yay! Thank you.

I'll do it.

Yeah.

Oh, you are the best.

Hey, Nick.

Yeah.

For Elvis-themed music, what about Elvis?

I'm really... I'm so slammed right now.

I can't hear, like, new stuff.

WINSTON: Looking good, man. This was Walt's best suit.

Look at all these buttons, Winston.

I look like a remote control.

It looks good.

I can't mourn in this.

I don't even know how to use these buttons.

Hey, look, we're not mourning, okay?

This is a celebration, you know? That's what funerals are about...

Winston, I just can't go to the funeral, okay?

I don't want to go!

What the hell is the problem?

Look, I really want to support Nick. I do.

I want to support his family.

I want to be there for him, but...

I'm scared of death.

Uh... wow. Uh...

Schmidt, you know, death is natural, you know?

It's a natural part of life. Everybody's scared of death.

Death, Winston.

(Whispering):

Death. Death.

And let me ask you something, Winston:

What's with this open casket thing?

All of a sudden, I-I got to walk in and I got to see the carcass?

That's crazy.

What if... what if his eyes open?

What if his eyes open, and then he comes and haunts all of us? Why do... Why...

Literally, why are the buttons on here?

Because they're not holding anything together, yet I don't know which buttons are buttoned.

How do you get this thing off, Winston?!

I don't understand this middle-class button system!

Get it off of me!

(Panting)

So I don't think I'm gonna go to the funeral, man.

I think I'm gonna hang back.

So, um, I'm helping Nick with the eulogy.

I'll give you the goods on Walt, Glasses Face.

My pop had a table at every diner in the city.

He had silverware from the finest hotels in the area.

He had a gold chain as thick as floss.

But, like, thick floss.

Wait, Walt's got that chain?

Yeah, he got that chain. That's his chain.

That was my dad's chain.

No, it was Walt's signature piece.

No, he got that from the Seiko watch deal.

No, he got it from the dishwasher arrangement.

No, he didn't. JAMIE: Yes, he did.

My dad took a dart in the eye for that.

I don't care what your dad took a dart in the eye for.

Guys. Guys, guys, guys.

Can we refocus? JAMIE: I can't!

Because he's accusing my father of thievery! - Hey!

Can we just talk about Walt? JAMIE: Yeah, so what's the deal with you and Nick? Are you guys, uh...

Could you...

could you stop doing that with your eyebrows?

Please stop doing... Stop.

They're doing it. They're doing it.

Yeah.

No.

Whoever denied it supplied it.

Now, this would be the casket.

(Sighs)

And now I'm d*ad.

So approach me and don't be afraid.

Just promise not to move, all right?

That's what I'm afraid of most.

Are you k... are you kidding me?

Also, you can't breathe.

Schmidt, I need to breathe, okay?

Because I'm coaching you, and also for regular life reasons.

Now, just calm down, find a joyful memory and let it lift you to the sky.

(Exhales)

(Sighs)

You left us too soon, you beautiful black butterfly.

Start over.

You know, when we first met, I thought that we would be rivals.

For Nick's attention, for who wore Easter colors best.

And then rivalry became friendship.


(Chuckles)

We've laughed, we've swum.

You cut my toenails.

Are you the brother that I never had?

No.

You're the brother that I've always had.

That was beautiful.

(Shouts) What are you doing, man?!

You moved! Whoa! What the hell?

Of course I moved! I'm not a real d*ad person!

You ghoul!

Why do I do this for you?

Forget it, man. I'm never going to this thing.

You just made it worse.

What's wrong with you?

$2,000?

What if it wasn't six feet under?

How much for three feet?

I've gone through half a pack of ciggie gum here.

You want some of my weed?

Where are we on the food?

We-we got to have Elvis food.

Ma, I'm making calls right now.

It's got to be perfect.

It's gonna be perfect. You just got to let me do it. - If the food isn't Elvis-themed, does it matter that much?

You got a problem with Elvis?

I don't... (Stammers) - No, she didn't say that. I'm gonna have to call you back.

No, she didn't say that. She didn't say that about Elvis. - I was just suggesting that maybe the Elvis theme doesn't matter as much...

You don't think Elvis is important?

She knows Elvis is important, Ma!

Elvis is everything!

I know. He's the King. He's the King.

I'm sorry, Bonnie. He's the King.

Jess.

Nick...

I'm here to help, but I can't write this eulogy. - Wait, what?

Do you want some of my weed? NICK: I asked you to do one thing.

I need you to write the eulogy.

But I didn't know Walt.

Nobody wants to hear what I have to say about my dad.

It doesn't matter what you say. You just... you h...

you have to say good-bye to him.

I'm not asking you to do too much.

Just write my father's eulogy.

I can't handle this!

JESS: Nick. BOBBY: My dad's chain!

JESS: Nick. BOBBY: I want that chain!

JAMIE: Hey, Nick! Nick! He popped me right in my cherry!

That's not what that means, Jamie!

JAMIE: Then what does it mean?! JESS: Nick!

Where are you going?

(Door shuts)

I forgot my jacket. It's really cold outside!

JESS:

Nick, wait!

JAMIE: Ow!

(Organ playing)

Hey.

Hey.

When's the last time you saw Nick?

Is he not here?

What are you guys talking about?

Schmidt, if you want to hear what we're saying, come over here.

Don't shout across the room.

It's bad luck to see the body before the funeral.

No, that's, like, a wedding thing, Schmidt.

Shh.

I think I said something to Nick.

I think this is my fault.

Hey, everybody! I brought Elvis!

NICK: Funeral saved. WINSTON: What?

Hey, happy funeral, Jess.

What happened?

What happened is I found this guy at the bar and he fits into the costume, so for 20 bucks, he's gonna be Elvis.

I thought you wanted me to k*ll Elvis for 20 bucks.

Then why would I give you the outfit, Brendan?

The element of surprise?

(Chuckling): Yeah.

The mirror effect?

He's gonna be perfect.

Mmm.

Whose birthday is it?

No, it's my dad's funeral.

I'm gonna go find cake.

How much have you had to drink?

One dozen beers. And I wrote...

I did what you asked me to do, Jessica.

I wrote the, uh, gigleography.

The what?

The gigleography.

A "gigleography"?

Urology.

Elegy? Eulogish.

You wrote the eulogy.

That's what I've been saying the whole time ... it's right here.

"Walt Miller. Am I right?"

Am I right? Am I right?

That's terrible.

Googaliogy!

All right, here's what we're gonna do.

I'm gonna sober up Nick and... and Elvis.

You, go buy us some time.

All right, Schmidt, stop asking people if they can smell the body. That is rude. - I'll try.

It's inappropriate and it's offensive, okay?

Okay, but I just...

All right? It's what I...it's what I'm thinking.

I got this. Shh. I got this.

Just don't say anything, okay? Come on.

Hi...

Uh... the chain.

Some... someone should stop...

'Cause he's taking the chain.

Hey, hey, quit it, man.

Don't do that.

Hey, b*at it, Cali.

Long Island, son.

I don't care.

Get off of it, man.

Just stop it. Stop it.

You touching me? You touching me?

Yeah, I'm touching you.

You don't touch me.

I don't want to go near that.

You don't touch me!

Quit it.

Do you want to go?

(Stammers)

Come on, do it. Come on, come on.

Here we go.

Get away from Walt's chain, man!

I'm just saying...

I... n-no! N-n-n-n-no!

Please, no, no, no, no! No!

Desecration!

Shut up.

(Shouts)

Shut up.

There's no desecration.

Don't interrupt me.

That's my dad's chain, and I'm taking it.

Shut your mouth.

What's wrong with you?

(Whispering):

Bobby, shut up.

Dude, he's d*ad. What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Ooh!

What are you doing?

I'm not afraid.

Not afraid of what? I'm not afraid.

I can do this.

I can do this all day.

Come on, don't do that.

All day, son.

Come on, don't-don't put your head in there.

Don't put your head in there, all right?

All day.

Dude, that's my uncle. SCHMIDT: Come get your chain, Boston!

What? All day!

All day! All day!

All day!

I don't need it.

I don't want it.

What's up!

I know you told me to write it, but I couldn't.

I didn't have anything to say.

You're mad at me.

You've got the mad face.

I'm not mad at you, Nick.

I'm not mad at you.

I have your back.

No matter what, no matter how stupid it gets, and...

you and I both know it can get really, really stupid.

I am the stupidest of all the stupid boys.

No.

I'm gonna be there, and I'm gonna hold your hand, and I wanted to tell you that last night, but you ran away.

Yeah.

(Loud grunt)

(Grumbles, sighs)

I want to meet your mom.

JESS:

Oh, my God.

Hey, Elvis!

What are we going to do, Winnie?

Everyone's waiting.

Mrs. Miller, how about I just go up there and I say a few words?

Keep it light, keep it happy.

Right.

Don't mention the felony thing.

Or Paraguay, or the storage space.

Hey, y'all.

Ah...

Now, some of y'all know me.

I am Winston.

And I look at today as a celebration.

So let's have a party. MAN: That's right.

You know, because a party is what Walt would have...

(Clearing throat)

(Choking up):

A party is...

a party, uh...

(Sobs)

Walt would have wanted us to have a party. WOMAN: Oh, dear.

(Winston grunts)

(Groans)

(Quietly):

I can do this.

I can do this, I can do this.

(Wails)

(Wailing sobs)

Oh, Walt!

I can't do this no more, Walt!

(Winston wails)

(Wailing continues in distance)

Hey. You done with this?

Hey! What's going on?

(Gasps)

(Groans)

This is Elvis?

No...

This funeral's going down the toilet.

I promised Walter it'd be beautiful and full of life.

I promised.

I'm sending everyone home.

Wait. Bonnie.

Are you tapping me on the shoulder, girlie?

Let me make this totally clear.

I don't want you here.

I don't know you.

I don't know your people.

You tap me twice?

I... please wait for Nick.

It's important.

Then why is he not here?

No eulogy? No Elvis?

I'd rather not have a funeral if it's not gonna honor my husband.

(Brendan groaning)

(Mumbles):

And I'm out.

(Clears throat)

I want to thank you for coming, but it's, uh, over now, so...

(Crowd murmuring)

JESS (Imitating Elvis):

Stop the funeral!

Everybody sit down.

This is the King.

What the hell?

I think you mean...

"What the heaven?"

Mama.

It's Elvis.

âª As the snow flies âª
âª On a cold and gray Chicago âª

What is this?

âª A poor little baby child âª
âª Was born âª
âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª
âª And his mama cried âª
âª Cause if there's one thing that she don't need âª
âª It's another hungry mouth to feed âª
âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª

You know, this is every day in North Korea.

âª Down in Chi-town âª
âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto. âª

I'm gonna h*t her.

Mom, please.

Dad would've liked this.

He would've faked a slip and fall and sued the funeral home.

(Laughter)

But he would've liked this.

(Nick chuckles)

Thank you, Jess.

You're welcome, Mama.

Oh...

(Sighs)

(Exhales)

I used to always tell my dad that I hated Elvis just to piss him off.

And he would get really mad the way Walt could get really mad.

And, uh, he would turn it up loud just to spite me and sing all the Elvis songs.

He was very good at gambling.

(Chuckles)

He had a great mustache.

(Sobs)

Hey, man.

What?

And he was so mean to cabbies in such a cool way.

And he never was scared.

(Sniffles)

How did he do that?

(Sighs)

I don't know if Walt was...

a good guy or a bad guy in the whole scheme of things, you know.

But he was my dad, and I'm sure gonna miss him.

âª âª

You okay, Mama?

Yeah, I'm gonna be okay, Mama.

âª 'Cause if there's one thing âª
âª That she don't need âª
âª It's another hungry mouth to feed âª
âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª

(Chuckles)

âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª

OTHERS:

âª In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª

(Laughs) OTHERS: âª

In the ghetto âª
âª In the ghetto âª

(Whoops)

OTHERS:

âª In the ghetto âª

I really feel transported to the ghetto.

âª In the ghetto, in the ghetto... âª

BOBBY: You owe me a gold chain, or at least the price of a gold chain.

Or maybe just a giant lobster. It's all about the gesture, and I will get my gesture.

My face touched the mustache of a carcass today, Bobby.

I'm not afraid of you.

I got some advice for you:

Stay out of Boston.

What, you gonna keep me out of the whole city?

I work TSA at Logan.

I'll put a g*n in your luggage.

Why do you got to bring w*apon into it, Bobby?

Hey, wh-where do you think you're going with that hat?

Bonnie, I just really wanted something to remember him by.

Uh-huh. Empty your pockets.

Okay, look, all I got is this fishing wire and a Wrigley ticket stub with a button, and then there's the...

there's the leg to his favorite chair, and there's the...

Come.

You keep it all.

Hey, Bonnie.

Oh, sorry.

Mm-hmm.

I almost tapped you.

(Laughing): You scare me.

(Laughs)

Pretty fun weekend all in, though, right?

I packed you a snack for the trip.

Oh.

Cheese puffs.

Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

Come here.

Oh...

Ooh.

JAMIE: Oh, hey, Nick?

Yeah?

How far away you are from getting married?

I don't know.

'Cause, uh, you know, DeAnn and I were thinking about getting married, so...

Jamie, you know, brothers don't have to get married in order.

DeAnn, we're doing this!

Hey, I couldn't find the, uh, cat.

I looked all over, but I just decided to clean out the litter box.

I... owe you an apology.

What are you talking about?

We all depended on you so much, and you were just a kid.

Don't do this, Ma.

I'm just saying.

You're going through enough.

I'm glad you have someone who takes care of you.

I love you, Ma.

Visit more.

So I don't have to talk to your brother all the time.

(Chuckles)

She said yes!

(Laughs)

(Groans)

(Nick screaming)

âª Ooh, hoo, hoo âª
âª I feel my temperature rising âª
âª Burning, burning âª
âª Must be 109 âª
âª Cause your âª
âª Kisses light my f*re âª
âª And the sweet sound of the choir âª
âª And you light my morning sky âª
âª Of burning love âª
âª Ooh, I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love âª
âª Ooh, I'm just a hunk, a hunk âª
âª Of burning love, ooh. âª

Pallbearers, please come down.

Ah... Three more, Cocktail Johnny.

Schmidt, that is melon-flavored liquor.

It's 4 proof, okay? That is safe to drink while you're pregnant.

Melon b*lls.

Schmidt, no matter how much you get drunk, Cece's still gonna be engaged.

Cece?

Now, I know you're down about it.

I'm not down about Cece.

This is, this is a mess. - Listen, there are plenty of things to be down about:

The air pollution in China, the deficit,

The Hobbit wasn't very good. If I want to see dwarves in a real-time dinner scene, I would've gone to Koreatown. Booyah! Ball me.

Ball you?

Ball me!

What are you...

How do you get these toppy things off, Nick?

Oh, Schmidt... You look like a lab rat.

Okay, you know what?

I'm adding that to your bill.

What the hell is this?

What?! You're giving us a check?

No more free drinks.

I didn't even know you had these here.

Take all of my money and then get out of my room.

You guys, come on.

Show a little respect. This is my job.

Nick, I saw you pee in the register.

Yeah, once.

You think I was sober for that?

You once put a sign out that said

"Take a Drink, Leave a Drink."

Okay, it's the only job I have, and I'm trying to be... good.

Okay? It's about time I got a little responsibility.

Responsibility?

I thought of a new promotion ... it's like Ladies' Night but it's the opposite:

It's Guys' Night.

The new manager loved the idea, and if it goes well ...

Maybe there's a promotion;

I can start moving up in the world.

What?

I want him.

I want him... bad.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

What is this?

I think Nick being ambitious and driven about the bar is making me...

want him more. Is that, like, a thing?

No. No woman's ever been attracted to power and success.

It's just like...

I thought it was one kiss and then it was over.

Hey, sorry, I'm just putting a load on.

Got a shift at the bar.

You know that there's a separate compartment to put the soap in?

I didn't know that.

Little soap house.

Anyway, I'm getting this mess cleaned up.

I gotta say, it feels really good.

Do any of you guys know where the iron is?

Get out!

What? I want to iron my button-down.

Get out, Nick!

What is happening right now?

Get out!

Why are you being so mean to me?

Get out!

What is going on with you?

There's a new manager; That's why I'm making you guys pay.

And you actually care about what he thinks?

Hey, Shane.

Hey.

Hey, guys. This is Shane. This is my new manager.

Oh, got it.

I'm really excited to have her here.

We're really getting this place in order. We're, uh...

Makes a lot more sense now.

God, I can't stop thinking about the other night.

Hope you gave that bar an extra wipe-down.

Yeah.

You're just like the opposite of everyone I went to business school with.

I mean, look at you. You're just... You're so real. - Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

He's incredibly real.

As real as they get.

Yeah, the realest.

Shut up, both of you.

You're a mess.

Yeah. - I got dirt on my face after we made out.

God, I loved it. Get back to work.

You got it.

Get back to work!

I'm joking. No, but seriously, Yeah. Joke. Seriously, get back to work. Yeah.

Get back to work. Yeah.

I know this isn't gonna end well, but the whole middle part's gonna be awesome.

Good for you.

What?

Schmidt, stop drinking that.

I'm gonna take care of this.

If I feel down, I come here.

I love this place, man. You know, the sound of bubbles, soothing synth music.

If this place doesn't take your mind off of Cece, then I don't know, man.

Look at that.

So beautiful.

And exotic.

Perfect curves.

Giant almond eyes.

Caramel-colored stripes.

Sumptuous lips.

Are you talking about the fish?

Excuse me. You, sir, that works here.

What is this fish ... the one that floats like an angel?

How much for this one?

Ah, that is the lovely but elusive California lionfish.

It's perfect. I must have it.

S-Sadly, sir, you can't.

What do you mean I can't?

It's... illegal, sir.

This fish is protected by the great state of California.

Gimme it!

No...?

What are you doing? Why can't I have the things that I want?

Sorry about that.

Don't look at the fish, kids.

You can't have any of them!

None of them are for sale!

Love is a lie. It is.

Calm down!

Love is a lie. Love is a lie.

We're leaving. We're leaving.

Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

Schmidt, no. Absolutely not.

No! I don't trust fish.

They breathe water ... that's crazy.

Yeah, he's got a whole thing going.

Schmidt ... an aquarium?!

When did you become a Bond villain that couldn't afford not to live with roommates?

This is where I will keep my lionfish.

Your lionfish?

A rare beauty.

The result of generations of interracial fish breeding.

Just undulating in that water with that wry smile.

Perfect, round fish breasts.

Pull it together.

What is this hat?

They say it'll be impossible for me to have it.

But I'll get it. She will be mine, and...

we will create a life together.

We're not talking about fish here, are we? - No.

Clearly talking about Cece.

Yes.

Yeah, 'cause he said

"fish breasts."

He said "fish breasts."

Yeah.

I mean, fish don't have boobs.

Hmm?

Hey, Jess.

That's my name. What's yours?

Just kidding. I know what it is. It's Nick.

You okay?

Yeah.

You haven't stopped moving

since we've been talking.

Hmm?

It's a nice-looking dress. You look good in it.

Oh, God. Okay.

Jess! Jess, wait!

Jess... Jess, would you please wait?

Hey, I was wondering, can I get a ride to the hardware store?

I want to throw a punching bag up at the bar for Guys' Night, but my car's not working, so can I get a ride?

No. Mm-mm. No.

Come on, can I please have a ride?

Wait, hold on. Don't move. Hold on.

You got an eyelash.

Why do you smell so good?

It's 'cause I did laundry.

Ah. I smell like a baby in a damn meadow.

Look at this. My underwear.

What? What?

-They're blue now. I think it's 'cause I put colors in the whites. - Uh-huh.

I'm still figuring it out, but I'm really excited about laundry.

Good job. - Hey, how do you put your underwear back in?

Just... I feel like it's too big to get back in now.

It's tricky to get it in.

Fine!

Thank you.

Do you mind if we stop along the way? I'm thinking of getting a salad 'cause I want to eat healthier.

Oh! God! Nick!

I'm thinking of taking a vitamin today.

Oh, God! Shut up!

It's good.

Yeah.

Yank that chain.

Yank it.

I feel like Russell Crowe in every movie he's ever done.

All right, Nick. Um, we have to go.

We just got here.

We have tons of stuff we need to get. - Fine.

Let me see what we have left.

A whole bunch of stuff.

Long-shafted... drive drill?

New nut wrench?

Our old nut wrench is bad.

Quick-hardening... caulk.

You don't want to wait forever for that caulk to harden.

Lube for... drill shaft.

And we ... also, can we get a box of gummy sharks?

Just remember... you caught him pleasuring himself to a mail-order steak catalogue.

Hey, Jess, I need the cart!

Look what I found!

Look at this big ol' pipe.

Check it out, Schmidt ... I got you a clownfish.

I don't want some janky freshwater bitch fish, Winston.

I want a lionfish.

Let's just cut through the crap, okay, Schmidt? We both know what you really want is Cece.

Cece the woman?

Yeah.

You can't put a woman in a fish t*nk, Winston.

That doesn't make any sense.

Look, Winston, if there was one thing that stood between you and happiness, don't you think I would be there to help you get it?

No matter how stupid it was?

You're right, Schmidt.

If I was doing something stupid, you definitely would be involved.

Yeah, you're damn right I would be.

And I would probably be there to make it even stupider.

Now, I'm going to walk out that door, and I'm gonna pursue the object of my dreams.

And if you don't want to join me, then I'm gonna carry that weight alone.

I'm in.

Let's get you a lionfish. Where do we start?

We're gonna start at the source.

The ocean.

That's an even better idea.

Hey, Jess.

I got some hot soup.

I feel good...

Jessy feel good...

Mmm.

I like to say words with my mouth.

Well, your jaw is super bruised, so you need to get some rest. But you have some fun pain meds.

Right?

I like you.

Yeah, I like you, too, Jess.

Yeah... and I like, your little bubble belly.

Oh, thank you.

bl*ws up like a... bubble.

Yeah, that's what it does.

I want to have sex with you!

Okay.

I want to have sex with you.

Whoa, do you know what you're saying right now, Jess?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

I want to have sex with you.

Sexy time for you, says me.

You are a beautiful white man, Nick Miller.

Okay.

Read all about it.

Yeah.

I'm Judy Garland.

Yeah, so it's the pills.

This is nonsense.

Whoa! Jess, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no...

Heck, no... no...

Don't do this right now.

I'm Judy Garland.

Hey, Judy, let's get you to bed, doll.

Whoa, whoa! You are way too drugged-up for this... okay...

This little piggy went to the market.

That little piggy can't be touched by you right now. - This little piggy went... ... this little piggy went to market!

It's hot! I put my hand in the hot soup!

Ow! You... aah!

Hey, Nick!

Will you be a doll and get me some mustard?

That is not flattering on you.

 You're an incredibly lovely man.

Are you calling my phone?

Yeah, I'm calling it right now, Winston.

I can't find it.

Are you kidding me?

Damn it, Winston!

It took me 20 minutes to fit this thing over your hips.

Whoa, okay. Hey! Hey!

Careful! Hey! What are you...

Why is your waist so weird?

That's my ass cheek! Sch-Schmidt!

I'm getting your phone.

That kind of tickles.

Hey! Stop saying "That's my ass cheek" and stop touching his butt!


Look at that shiner.

Not cool!

Somebody messes with my boy, that means we mean "bid-ness"!

We doing this? Let's do this!

Are we not... are we not doing it? It doesn't feel like you guys want to do it.

Let's just say hypothetically that a girl says something to you while she's on painkillers.

Mm-hmm.

And that girl says that she might want to have sexual intercourse with you.

Please tell me we're not talking about Jess.

And you had no idea that's how she felt.

Like, no idea. You thought the door was closed.

In fact, you thought that door was so closed that you went out to another door, but had I known that the first door was open, that's the door I wanted to walk through.

Wait, okay, wait...

I would've walked through that door.

Do you see how I'm in a tough spot?

Can we stop calling it

"walking through a door"?

Because for me, I feel like it's more like sliding past a drape.

Okay, if a girl on painkillers says that she wants to have sex with you, Mm-hmm.

is that the drugs or is that real?

And if so, how do I end it with Shane before Jess finds out?

I-I-I meant the door.

Nick, Jess...

All right, good talking, guys.

Good stuff. Yeah, I love that.

Hey, guys.

What happened to your eye?

You smashed me in the face, remember?

Right here.

That's funny.

Seriously, what happened?

Is your jaw okay? I bit my face.

Oh, you know what?

I can't even feel it.

The doctor's got me so goofy on these painkillers, it's like it never happened.

It's like it never happened.

But I sure got a chin shiner.

Yeah, you do.

Right?

So, I'll see you at Guys' Night.

Uh, no, no, no, you...

I don't...

I think you should rest.

Yeah, girl, you gotta protect that face.

Yeah, hey, for real, you should stay home and you should rest, Jess.

That's so sweet.

Thanks, guys.

What are doing out here?

This is crazy.

We've been standing in the ocean for two hours trying to steal an illegal fish.

I don't know why you want that damn fish so bad.

But what I do know is that it's gonna make you happy.

And that's all I care about.

Remember, I'm the one who shaved your shoulders after you got that scoop-neck sweater.

I appreciate it.

I'd do the same to find whatever it is that makes you happy.

You want to lose that last 55 pounds, I'll help you do that.

I don't got 50 pounds to lose.

It's very evident in this outfit.

Right there. I see something.

Lionfish!

Son of a...

What the...?

Jellyfish!

What?

Jellyfish!

Whoa, Schmidt.

Jellyfish!

What happened?

It got me, it got me!

What do I do?

What do I do?

It got me, Winston!

It burns!

Okay!

Burns!

So what do I do?

I need you to pee on my face.

What?

You need to pee on my face.

I can't.

It will sterilize the wound. Please do it, Winston.

I can not pee on your face.

I thought you were with me to the end.

I just peed in the ocean, so I'm all out.

You peed in the ocean?

Yeah, look...

Disgusting!

Okay, look, look, I know this is a dumb question, but will number two help?

What?

Free beers, Gorilla Bowl of nachos.

Gonna be two dozen dollars, boys.

Didn't realize we could make a $22 profit on nachos.

Guys' Night is genius.

Right?

Hey, um, look, uh, I think you're great, I just, uh, I can't keep...

I can't keep running to get cheese every time somebody orders nachos.

I love how worked up you get over cheese.

Get down there. Run.

Ooh...

who do I have to do around here to get a bucket of nachos?

Right here. Right here. How you doing?

I wasn't serious.

Wendell. Hi.

Gentlemen... There's a really literal vibe around here.

What are you doing here?

This morning you said you weren't coming, Jess.

I actually don't remember this morning at all.

But I would never miss this. I'm so proud of you. - Free beers!

Free beer.

You guys went through those!

Wait a minute...

More free beers.

Guys' Night is men drink for free?

Well, it's Guys' Night.

Oh.

You know...

I...

it's not a really good idea.

You know, because women won't show up, and...

You know?

He's our little idea man.

Hey...

So full of ideas.

She just slap your ass?

Sure. She's like a...

she's my boss and like a coach.

We're a team here.

We all slap each other's butts all the time.

Right here! Keep up the good work!

Why don't you go get us some ice, Big Bob?

Just slap my butt, Big Bob.

Show me some butt love.

f*re me off!

Some butt love?

Take a slice of that.

Oh, you got right up in there.

Hey, hey...

Oh, Shane, Shane, Shane...

Wait...

Is she...?

No.

Uh, yeah.

Are you...?

No. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're sleeping together.

So what?

We're all sleeping together.

Big Bob is...

I'm sorry, Jess.

Why... I mean, why are you sorry?

You're a free man.

Just... you're just... you know...

getting some t*nk on it.

Did you really just say that to me in my own bar?

Nick, who is this?

Yeah, Nick, who am I?

Shane, this is Jess.

She's my, uh...

Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Hmm... my room... friend.

I'm your "room friend," Nick?

Jess, don't...

I'm sleeping with Nick, too.

You don't have to do this, Bob.

I have to go.

Big Bob, that was really sweet.

Thank you, Bob!

Jess, wait!

Hey, hey.

What are you doing here?

He left me a voicemail from the ambulance.

He was rambling a lot, but I brought him this.

Whoa, where'd you get that?

You know, one of the perks of being a model.

You get to meet a lot of sketchy people.

The guy who got me this also said he could get me a box of dolphin steaks or a mostly white baby.

Good to know.

How's he doing?

Uh, hey, listen, I think it might be good for him if you just gave him some space.

Space?

Cece, you're getting married.

It's k*lling him.

Okay.

Yeah.

Um, just tell him I came...

Mm-hmm.

...by, or... or not.

Uh-huh.

He's waking up. You should go.

Okay.

You know... roommate.

Winston.

Hmm?

I just realized something.

It was never about a fish.

It was a metaphor.

It was about Cece.

Don't feel bad about not seeing it.

Look, man, it was subtle as hell.

Oh, my God, is that a lionfish?

Where'd that come from?

The...

The lion... the lionfish?

You. That came from you.

When the paramedics came, you...

you had it in your hand.

They were like, "Whoa, you can't get one of these."

And I was like,

"He caught it in a..." You did it.

Hello, fish Cece.

Gonna put you back in the sea.

I'm sorry, what? Look, Winston, I don't know if it was the jellyfish's venom or the paramedic's urine, but it made me realize...she's not mine to keep.

She belongs out there.

In the great, wide open ocean.

Uh, Schmidt, that don't go to the ocean.

What are you, the city planner?

Hi.

Well, I've got some explaining to do.

Shut up.

I'm really happy her name is Shane.

Mm... mm-hmm.

Who's next?

Cody?

Tex? The sheriff?

Mm.

Hey, Jess...

last night, when you were on pills...you said you want me.

Shut up.

You put your hand in my pocket.

No, I didn't...

You said, "This little piggy wants to go to the market."

Shut up, Nick.

It's something you were just saying, that's fine, that's cool, we'll move on and not talk about it, but it is something that I've thought a lot about.

But you were never clear about that, so that there were other options.

And this little piggy ran around to different markets, but he didn't know.

What are you talking about?

Do you want to have sex with me, yes or no?

Yes!

No! Yes! I mean, I did.

But that was before I knew that you were... you were doing all that for your boss, so you sleep with her.

Fine, forget-forget the boss.

Okay.

Well, I just, you know, I thought it was...

it was nice to see you actually trying at something.

So...

That's why you were more attracted to me?

Wait a second.

I thought it was attractive that you were trying.

That's why?

You're a frickin'

gold digger, Jess.

What?!

I think that's what you just said.

If I were a gold digger, do you think I'd be interested in you?

I would be the worst gold digger in the world.

You're a friggin' gold digger.

No, I'm not, Nick.

I'm so disappointed in you.

Shut up!

I'm not a gold digger.

Then prove it.

Ow! My jaw.

What?

Then move your damn head.

Then kiss me like a man!

Damn it!

What's wrong with your hand?

I burnt it in your damn soup. Is that what you wanted...

Well, who burns their hand in soup?

I do!

You're a mess!

You are so annoying with your little shorts.

Why are you so angry all the time?

I told you, shut up.

Shut up and take off your clothes right now.

And I mean it, take off your clothes.

You're just chaotic. Everywhere you go.

Stop talking!

Wherever you go! You are ...

-This is not the time to talk, that is the stupidest thing...

Oh...

I'm gonna grab some paper towels.

An aquarium the size of a sixth grader just broke, and you're grabbing paper towels?

Yes, I'm getting paper towels.

What are you thinking?!

Okay, you know what?

I'm out. - You can't clean this up with paper towels.

I'm not...

You don't want to clean it up.

No, that's not what it is.

Well, you know what?

If you're not cleaning it up, I do not want to be told...

I'm not cleaning it up.

...what to do, by you, right this second!

I'm not... just 'cause I'm a woman?

That's it! I'm out!

Please.

You piss me off!

This is a bad idea.

I know you're going out into the ocean lionfish, but...

I ever see you again, then...

well...

And should you meet a charming...

physically fit, what ... I don't know, whatever kind of fish gefilte fish come from...

Treat him well.

Be careful.

You gotta be kidding me!

-Oh, sh**t.

Stay alive!

Stay alive!

Cece!

This month marks Nick and my ten year anniversary of living together.

Our "tin" anniversary.

Ten years? You guys are like Bert and Ernie.

I got dibs on Bert.

Dibs on Ernie.

Nice.

Cool, man. All right.

Yeah, man.

Now, obviously, we're going to have an anniversary party.

You guys are invited.

I'm not sure if I'm coming to that, man.

Remember the "wood" anniversary?

Ah!

You cut me!

Well, happy anniversary!

I gotta get a tourniquet.

Hold some more wood for me.

Yeah!

Well, it wasn't as bad as paper.

Happy anniversary!

Paper!

Party time, man.

Did you know that the chemical symbol for tin is SN?

Schmidt and Nick.

What?

Is no one else's mind bl*wn by this?

That's it, our theme is TinFinity.

TinFinity. That's actually really good, Schmidt.

Yeah, it is.

I really don't think two men who live together for ten years need a party.

Why must you always be like this?

Because you never let me participate in the planning.

I would love for you to participate.

Gah! That was a trick. I was trying to get out of it.

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

They're celebrating

ten years of living together?

Why are we friends with these guys, Jess?

I...

What happened?

It's so weird to think that Nick is the last person I kissed.

Actually, Schmidt's the last person I kissed.

Okay, what?

It was nothing. Nick was watching.

What is happening in this loft?

Ooh, girls chatting.

Hey, Nick.

I wish I knew what was going on inside Nick's head.

He's this, like, grumpy mystery.

Jess, are these open for anybody?

Yep.

Right on, thank you.

He can't communicate a feeling to save his life.

But why can't I stop thinking about his mouth on my mouth?

Hey, Jess, do I have frosting on my lips?

Look at my mouth ... do I have frosting on it?

Wh-Why are you asking me this?

My mouth feels moist and weird.

Do I have anything on it?

Get out of here! Ugh! Aw...

Okay, you know what?

You need what I needed. You need a new guy, all right?

Dating Shivrang helped me get past all the weird stuff with Schmidt.

I need the Anti-Nick.

Yeah.

I need a real man, who can express his feelings, and I need a different mouth on my mouth.

To erase that mouth.

No, you actually

don't need to wash raw denim.

Haven't washed my pants in 18 months.

Also, I'm bisexual.

Microchips be gettin' small.

They be, like, blueberry size.

So you could put 'em in your cereal, girl.

I don't get your thing.

It's prescription.

Damn it.

What happened to the guys in this bar?

They open up a bus station next door?

Where are the real men?

I can't talk right now.

I'm writing a strongly-worded e-mail to my florist.

Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, look at the door, don't look at the door, look right now, don't look, one at a time, look, but don't look. Guys, one at a time.

Don't look now.

Look. No, you're both looking.

I don't know what to do.

I'm confused.

Look right now at the door. Go.

Oh...

that is a strapping young man.

That is Jax McTavish.

He plays safety for San Francisco.

Why's he with Winston?

Winston looks so cool.

What up, guys?

Oh, "What's up, guys."

You're just gonna walk over and say, "What's up, guys?"

Winston, does he think you're Omar Epps?

You guys talking about Jax?

Look, I interviewed him at the radio station, and we just h*t it off.

It's not a big deal, you know, unless you think hanging out with a pro baller is a big deal.

His hands are so big and warm.

I want to fall asleep in them, like Thumbelina.

How about, uh, introducing me?

Yeah, okay. You and Jax?

Yeah.

Jess and Jax McTavish.

Great bit, Jess.

What a dumb idea.

Do it.

No.

You can't handle that kind of thunder.

Hell, no.

Jax and I are just becoming friends.

I'm going over there.

Jess, no, Jess.

Guys...

Hey, Jess, let me show you something. Hmm?

It's right here.

Hi, I'm Jess. I'm Winston's roommate.

How you doing?

I'm Jax.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Jess, stop it, stop it.

Cool, so I hear you play for San Francisco. - I do.

7.8 tackles, man, I can't believe you didn't go to the Pro Bowl.

Here's my question:

What's a "point-eight" tackle?

Did you know I'm a teacher?

What would you teach me?

Nick... the theme is

"masculine garden party."

Look at that ... I made a graph.

I thought you said I was gonna help you plan it.

Nick, we both know that you're not very good with party chores.

You sent out the invitations, right?

Me?!

I sent them out?

Okay, I'm older now. I am wiser.

I want to help plan my own party.

Okay, fine, I will give you balloons...

Oh, sweet, balloons are...and Porta Potties. Porta Potties?!

That sounds like a job for babies.

Does that look like a job for babies?

Oh, so this is a big job?

I thought you were being disrespectful. - No!

Oh. - Where do you think people are gonna go to the bathroom?

I never thought of that.

And you are now in charge of that, and if you dig a hole in a- in, in a dirt field, I'm gonna k*ll you.

I don't want the responsibility.

You can do this, man.

What, what are your chores?

Well, Porta Potties.

Porta Potties.

What's ... now, what is the first chore that I gave you?

I have absolutely no memory.

Balloons!

I'm having an anxiety att*ck.

Yes, Ma, yes, now, look, I-have to go.

It's two men celebrating living together for ten years.

Uh, no, they're not.

No, I can tell you for a fact that they're not.

Okay, okay, I'm hanging up.

So, good news.

Um, my mom spoke to your mom last night, and they've given us their blessings.

So that means...

Well, now that the moms approve, when do you want to do this thing?

Is that a... that a proposal?

Oh, are, are you upset? I'm sorry, I...

It's just, with arranged marriage, there isn't a lot of romance.

No, no, no, I'm s ... I'm sorry, actually.

I think I'm just a little taken aback by how quick this all has been.

I barely know you, and...

I used to just think that if I was being proposed to, I would notice it was happening.

But we're doing this thing?

Maybe you could just stop saying "doing this thing."

Yup.

Really did it.

Beautiful job, thank you so much, what a...

This is amazing ... everything's tin, you guys, everything.

Hey, man.

Rented out the whole park, so take your soccer someplace else.

Give us our ball back, you douche.

Hey, yeah, sure, no, I'll give you your ball back. Great.

Pure tin, pure tin.

Take your football back to Europe.

Really? - Who's the douche now, you douche "B"?

I couldn't stop you from inviting Jax to the party, but I can stop it from going any further.

I will not lose Jax as a friend, okay?

I might not have any game, but, oh, my goodness, can I take game away.

I'm getting that mouth on my mouth, and don't you try to stop me, you...

Look, clearly I have the upper hand when it comes to Jax.

Do you? - Oh, I do, because I know all about sports.

Jess, you know nothing about sports.

Oh, what am I going to do? I guess I'll just have to use my eyes, hair, boobs, legs, and adorable personality.

Fool.

I got, like, three of those things.

These are amazing.

You also got tablecloths?

I feel so fancy.

How much did you spend on this, Schmidt?

Ah, Nicholas, I have what's called an income, you know.

Well, you're not the only one who spent a little bit of money on this.

Okay. - Check this out, Schmidt, you're gonna freak out.

Hey, I'm presenting, I'm presenting it.

And that ain't no rental.

Get up here.

This is owned and operated by Mr. Nick Miller.

Little help from Sid.

You bought a Porta Potti?

This one has warm and cold water, real soap dispensers, a fan.

Too much.

What's that? That's garbage.

Garbage ... that's what the nursing home said about my mattress. I'll take it.

For 60 bucks, and they threw in something called

"septic enzymes," which I don't know what that is, but you're not supposed to get it in your eyes, for sure.

I'm a small business owner.

Why on earth would you buy a...?

You know what? Forget about it, I'm proud of you.

Thank you, man. - I gave you a chore and you came through.

Yeah, now, look, now we have two.

What do you mean we have two ... two of what?

Two bathrooms.

Yours and El BaÃ±o Presidente.

That's a Porta Potti?

Yeah, luxury toilet.

I thought that was the visitor's center.

Well...

That's enormous.

Why did you get that, Schmidt?

What, did you think I was gonna screw up?

No, come on, man, no.

You know how our relationship works.

I'm over-responsible, you're under-responsible.

Here's the good news ... now people have a backup to use...

No, I want everyone to use this, I want it to be the main potty.

Oh, n-no, I don't think that should be the main anything.

I think people would be better off if they just made a caca in their hand.

I don't think so;

Mine's better than that.

I'm sure you k*lled it on balloons.

Well... if you let me explain what happened with the balloons...

Who needs balloons?

I didn't want balloons anyway.

This isn't a little girl's birthday party.

This is a celebration of friendship.

Then, as a friend...

Yeah.

I want you to get rid of that.

I want everybody using mine.

You spit on the...

You brought a dirt dungeon to our TinFinity.

All right, well, we'll see.

I'm proud of you;

You did good.

I'm proud of you. You bought a spaceship.

Hey, man, you watch Homeland?

No? I'm in the first season, second episode.

Don't spoil anything.

Hey, flag on the play.

Too many men on the field.

Winston, get out.

Jax, over here on the bench with me.

Come on, let me show you some stuff.

Okay.

Go, go, Jess, go.

Oh, boy.

You want me? Come and get me.

I'm gonna get you... you can't get by me.

You're down.

Why would you do that?

Winston, we're on the same team.

What are you doing?

You did it!

Touchdown!

Man.

N-N-No!

Why?

What's going on, Sid?

Did you tell 'em that ours works?

Hey, guys, this is available, no line.

That Porta Potti looks weird, Nick.

What?

It looks a little, looks a little weird.

You look a little weird, Sanders.

Why don't you wipe your butt with a little strawberry crepe, you little whiner?

I don't really do well with bathroom pressure.

Robby, don't dog me like this.

I'm gonna give you your space.

No, 'cause they're all following you, Robby, they're all...

Get in there.

I don't have to go anymore.

Really?

Yeah.

So that's not full of pee?

No.

I saw you drinking those sodas.

No, no, no, it's good.

How about now?

Stop, stop, you're gonna make me...

I don't have to go, I don't have to go.

Get in there, dude, or get out of this party.


Wrong choice.

Nick, what are you doing?

I bought a Porta Potti, Jess.

What, why?

Yeah.

I'm a small business owner...

You own a Porta Potti?

Yeah, but nobody's using it.

This is not about a Porta Potti.

It is about a Porta Potti.

I don't want to talk about this.

You know, it's been really nice hanging out with Jax because he likes to talk about his feelings.

Give me a break, Jess. Is that really what you want ...

a man who talks about his feelings all the time?

No, right?

Do you want me to use your Porta Potti?

Yeah, but don't just do it for me; Do it 'cause you want to.

Mm, I'm definitely doing it for you.

And just a tip...

Yeah?

If you want people to use your toilet, don't camp out in front of it.

Do me a favor, if you're going to go in.

Mm-hmm. - Really sell it, 'cause I want girls to see it.

Okay. - You know what I mean? Just, like, make a show of it.

Okay.

Thank you.

Bye, Jess, thank you Ooh, just my style!

Nicely vintage.

Can't wait to get inside!

Sure wish I had a good book.

Can't wait.

Oh, this is horrible!

I got it; You told me like, ten times.

Okay, but I'm just saying, I don't know what that one does.

Look, the instant the big speech begins, you initiate toast sequence.

You got that, Red?

Look, don't-don't mess this up.

Tippy go bye-bye, you mess this up.

Tippy go bye-bye.

Okay.

Okay, great.

Bite me, you wang.

What did you say, man?

Hey, Schmidt.

Hey.

You remember Shivrang?

Shivrang, what is up, my man?

Welcome to America.

Listen, just a little heads up, we're serving cow-meat tacos tonight, so...

You mean beef.

Cow meat, Shivrang.

I'm not crazy.

It is beef, right?

Hey, can I just say I like you a lot?

I like you, too.

A lot?

'Cause I said "A lot."

I-I knew I felt this way, the moment I met you.

Yes, a guy who can tell me exactly how he feels.

That's what I want.

That is what I want.

It's just...

You, uh...

You make me...

Are you okay?

I-I like you a lot.

Yeah, I-I...

Yeah...

I'm fine, I mean...

You know what else I like?

I like beer.

I drink beer.

'Cause I'm a man, and I play football.

You want some beer? I'm gonna get a beer.

Hey, there you are.

Hey, Schmidty.

. It's almost toast time, and I made... - Okay.

...made up a few cards. You know, just jotted down a few notes and b*llet points for you.

I was gonna do my own toast.

I know what I want to say about you.

At least take a look at them.

I worked really hard on these.

"I'm nothing without you."

"Thank you for supporting me

"during that thing, financially and..."

This is a full speech.

Feel free to make it your own.

Why is it that you think you're better than me, Schmidt?

What? What are you talking about?

Why do you think you're better than me?

Our friendship didn't used to be this way.

You know, back in college, we were equals.

You get any last night?

No. You?

Hell, yeah.

Really?

No.

We're equals.

Equals.

And then you got that juicer, which I was excited about.

You were at a dangerous fat level, but somehow you got skinny, and I became this idiot that you need to take care of.

Don't resent me for getting my life together.

Oh, your life's together?

Yeah.

You're throwing a party to celebrate living with your college roommate for ten years.

Yeah.

What are we doing here?

What are we celebrating?

What do you mean,

"what are we celebrating?"

We're celebrating TinFinity!

Ten years, two hearts, one home!

Loyalty and great conversation.

It's right here on the cards!

Okay, that ain't right.

Hey, Winston.

Aha.

I see you've come to gloat.

Is Jax known for being intense?

Yeah, Jess, he's supposed to be intense.

He's a professional athlete.

You know, he doesn't run.

He sprints.

He doesn't jump. He leaps.

And he doesn't like, Jess. He loves.

Hmm.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey, look, I'm sorry about...

No, no, no, no, don't be... don't be sorry. It's...

The truth is...

I just got out of a relationship that sort of crushed me.

And everybody thinks that pro football players are big and strong, and I am.

It's true. Look.

Whoa!

This is nothing for me.

I can have 20 of you.

Never put me down.

But that means...

when I fall, I fall hard.

And yes, sometimes I cry.

I cry, too. I cry all the time.

I cry in my bedroom, in the bathroom, in the hallway, in the elevator.

This morning... I woke up crying.

I have this feeling...

it's like I've known you forever.

I have this feeling, too.

Like, I want to French you.

I really want to French you.

Ex-Excuse me. Can I... Can I have your attention, please?

Uh, excuse me. Could I please have your attention?

Um... Oh. Whoa.

Hello. I don't know, um, any of you, but I'm Shivrang. Hello.

âª It started off so well... âª

And... oh, there's music now.

Um, look...

And... Oh. Oh.

What the hell is this?

Um, Cece, where are you?

Hey.

Uninitiate toast sequence! This isn't it.

This song is for Nick and I!

-âªIn your glory and your love âª

Look, I know I said I wasn't gonna do some big proposal thing, but that being said, I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with you, so...

Wow!

âª Were nothing but a sham âª

Cece...

Do you, um... do you want to do this thing?

âª I'll love you until I die... âª

Yes.

Yes? Yeah?

Yes.

Yeah.

Are you sure?

âª Save me... âª

Oh.

Oh, wow.

This is nuts.

I-I didn't do this.

âª Save me, save me âª
âª Save me âª
âª I'm naked and I'm far from home... âª

It's shaped like an infinity sign, because they're going to be married forever.

âª The slate will soon âª
âª Be clean... âª

Thank you.

Thank you. Thanks.

âª To start again with somebody new... âª

Hi. Uh, I'd like to say something, too.

That's Jax McTavish.

I know.

Um, I'd like to report a missing item.

My heart.

It was stolen by that little heart thief right there.

I'm... I'm innocent. I didn't... I was framed.

I just want to say in front of God and all these people at this gorgeous party that I'm in love with you.

Mm... no. No.

And I know it's early...

Nah.

...but I think I met the girl that... I'm gonna marry.

Who...? Who?

I'm gonna marry you!

We are not on the same page.

I'm gonna marry you.

I'm gonna put a baby in you.

We're gonna have dogs and cats.

I met my third wife!

Schmidty? Schmidty?

Schmidty? Hey.

Schmidt...

Stop it!

You okay, buddy?

Yeah. No, I'm-I'm fine.

It's just, I'm really annoyed about the lighting cues.

Also, our girl-to-guy ratio is taking a real nosedive.

I mean, we're, like, two bro groups away from being a total wiener fest.

It's just really disappointing when things don't work out the way you thought they would, you know?

I do.

Hey, why don't we get out of here for a bit?

Get away from this party stress.

You mean, like, take a trip together.

No, just, like, walk 40 yards away.

Don't think we need a trip or anything like that, pal.

Jess?

Hey!

Hey!

Hey! Oh, my God!

So excited for you. Let me see it.

Yeah.

Oh. So beautiful.

Mm-hmm.

Is this good? This is good, right?

It's good.

I mean, it's-it's what I wanted.

Yes! Yay!

I'm getting married!

So, what are you... what are you doing in here?

I'm hiding.

Oh, yeah, that guy.

He seemed to, uh, really like you when he gave that speech. - Yeah.

He might not be the one.

So you still thinking about Nick?

No. Shut up. No.

All right.

Look at that, man. You did get a balloon.

Yeah, I got a kick-ass hot air balloon.

But it turns out, you need propane to get it up in the air.

You didn't know that?

How would I know?

You didn't want to do any research?

How could I do any research? I was dealing with the Porta Potti.

It's actually kind of nice.

It's peaceful.

Yeah.

Hey, I'm sorry about Cece, man.

I know it sounds kind of cheesy, but I always thought that I was gonna be the man to bone Cece for the rest of her life.

I think we all did, buddy.

To answer your question from before, this is what we were celebrating.

Yeah, that's right.

This is what we're celebrating.

Yes. Yes.

Yeah.

Right? You're my best friend, man.

Please.

Ten years of living together Upsetting, but kind of great, man.

Here's to it.

Yes.

Not having roommates is for real losers, you know that?

Mm-hmm.

Equals.

You said it, man.

Oh, you are such a Nancy boy.

What is in that, man?

Liquor!

âª If not for you... âª
âª Babe, I couldn't find the door... âª

Mm. You pick out a song for our first dance?

Yes, I did.

I didn't expect you to dance to it, but you know, I was going to dance for you.

Yeah. Come on, it's too close quarters for that, Schmidt.

That is beautiful. Pass the hooch.

Nick's been hogging it all.

Mmm. Here, have a sip.

My mouth's been on it. It's not a big deal.

It's just my mouth!

I... I... It's okay. I'm all right.

Come on, have a sip!

You put your mouth all over it!

You just said that. You put your mouth all over it, and I don't want to think about your mouth!

You okay? I just...

Yup, I'm fine.

What are you doing? What are you doing, Jess?

I just don't understand why we only have...

I mean, I feel like I should have my own bottle.

Because we were all gonna share...

I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going!

Where are you going?!

We're pretty awesome wingmen for each other.

Right.

Because we're both the guy the girls want to sleep with, and we're both the other guy, too.

Neither one of us are Tom Cruise or the other one.

We're both Iceman.

Yeah. Equals!

Equals!

You get a lot of girls?

Um, I don't know. Yeah...

Yeah. Me, too.

I feel like you probably have a lot of game with the ladies. - I know what they want sexually, and I'm not afraid to give it to them.

I get that from you. I get that vibe, man.

What about you?

I feel like I put off a similar vibe, but kind of more on the down-low, you know what I mean?

Yeah!

Equals!

Equals!

I like how things aren't weird between us.

Right? 'Cause if somebody walked in here and saw us, they'd be, like, "Look at those two totally normal roommates.

I bet they never sucked face."

But we did. You sucked my face.

I sucked your face.

You did.

Who cares?

You totally sucked my face.

Sorry that I touched your hand there.

It was accidental. Like, who acc...?

Yeah. I mean, which is cool,

'cause that's the thing. It's, like, we're just roommates.

Who cares? We're just cool.

I totally agree. Yes.

You know what I mean?

Let's reward ourselves,

'cause we're doing so well.

Table for two, fanciest restaurant in town.

Yeah, and then we could have sex.

Just joking, I was just jok ... I was just joking.

Yeah, no, I know it was a joke.

Spot. There's-There's a parking spot.

I just finished rinsing out the Dumpster, and while I was buffing the backside, I found this ...

4D.

So, who gets the spot?

Me.

You know what? I never get anything.

I would like it.

I need a win.

Give me the spot, or I'll k*ll you all!

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

I park under an overpass.

Guys, guys, guys, guys.

We all have crappy parking.

Guys, why don't we just all share the spot?

We'll each get it for a day and a half every week, and then we split Sunday into six-hour shifts.

Does it say "Share stuff"

in the Constitution of America?

No, it does not. Nicholas, what does it say?

Don't share stuff.

No one deserves that spot more than I do.

You know? 'Cause Lord knows, I've done my fair... share of...

spotworthy things.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry. Daisy travels so much, and I work at night, so, you know, our sex window is... like...

I've lived in this loft as long, if not longer, than anyone.

I have the crummiest room, I'm on 24-hour grout watch.

I pay the lion's share of the utilities, do I not?

I refuse to pay for the wiffi.

It's WiFi.

I didn't even have to tell you guys about the spot.

Why did I tell you guys about the spot? Oh, damn it!

I'm the dumbest boy in school!

As the only woman in the loft...

Don't play the lady card.

I will play the lady card.

Race card.

Lazy drunk card.

Deserves-the-spot card.

Do I not, every day, have to deal with Outside Dave?

Dave? I have to use my car now, Dave.

I work so hard, I just want some sleep!

Dave, I'm gonna go get some coffee.

Um, can I get you anything?

2% latte.

He throws dentures at me, he doesn't like cookies.

Because I believe so strongly in women's equality, I refuse to give you preferential treatment.

Well, that's really cool, Schmidt. I really...

Wait a minute.

Oh.

Sex window.

Now, if you all will excuse me, I am about to go and park my car on her parking spot.

Ew. Ew!

As if there was anything more important than this.

Get out.

I still want the spot, though. Obviously not getting the spot.

And then there were three.

That's right. Just the way I want it.

Come on! It's a good job, guys.

Yes! How do you two care about stuff so much?

Well, you know what this means, Jessica, don't you?

Nicholas Miller is now a swing vote.

What? No!

He's right, 'cause we're both voting for ourselves, so that makes you the decider.

You two are on your own. I'm out.

You can't escape destiny.

She comes for us all, that relentless bitch.

That's right. Destiny's a lady.

Destiny might be a lady, but victory has a penis.

Direct quote ... Scott Caan.

Yup.

Hey.

I found one of your hoodies, and I borrowed it.

You want to know what I'm wearing underneath this shirt?

Yeah, sure.

An invisible shirt.

I'm confused, Jess.

These are so long. Oh.

I wouldn't put that in your mouth.

Do you chew on this?

I do.

Mmm. You do, huh?

It's crunchy.

Oh.

You get h*t in the head or something?

Hmm?

Are you flirting with me to get the spot?

How dare you accuse me of that.

The parking spot is yours.

Really?

Yeah.

Thanks, Nick. That's so cool of you.

Sometimes I can be a gentleman, believe it or not.

Cool.

Cool. All right.

Well, thank you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Get in here. Yeah, we can...

Let's hug this out.

Purple nurple!

Thank you.

I don't know why I did that. I'll get ice.

Why did you do that?

Oh, finally. What took you so long?

I said 2:45, not 3:08.

I couldn't follow your directions.

I'm telling you, girl, this complex is like a maze.

Every building in this place looks exactly the same.

And for future reference, I'm more of a left-right kind of guy, not so much a north-south kind of guy.

Put on a condom.

Hmm... I don't, uh...

You forgot a condom?

You got a grocery bag?

No.

Tin foil?

No.

Hand sanitizer?

No.

You got a shower cap and a twist tie?

You didn't bring the one thing we need to have sex?

What about a baseball cap that's really small?

Are you serious?

Um, I got quick reflexes.

Mm, I'm gonna take care of this, okay?

Okay, well, look, do not waste my time.

I will be back faster than you can say,

"Damn, Winston, I took care of myself already."

Don't-don't say that, though.

Do not... Wait for me. Wait...

Who wants an ice-cold Heisler, all dressed up in a frosty mug?

Sure. I like beer.

I know you haven't officially decided on the spot yet, but I just wanted to say, thanks, man.

What for, Schmidt?

We both know that you're gonna give the spot to me, but I love that you're keeping up the charade.

Spot's going to Jess.

Jess?

Jess.

Give me the beer back.

I'm trying to be a gentleman.

Hey, Schmidt. Hey, Nick.

Oh.

How you doing?

Good. How are you?

Good.

What the hell?

Hmm?

What... the hell?

I'm checking my e-mails.

Oh. Okay.

Think that I'm blind? Think I can't smell it?

You think I can't hear it?

The stench of filth and lust is all over this room.

Smells like freaking Tijuana.

What... happened here?

Nothing.

Hardly anything.

Hardly anything?!

You know I'm not good at this, Jess.

Shut up. Okay, fine.

We kissed. Eh.

It was nothing. So? Uh, moving on.

Don't be weird about this, Schmidt.

Remember... I mean, it was like a dare, basically.

Yeah.

Mazel... tov to the both of you.

Well, I don't know what "Mazel tov" means, but it doesn't sound good.

Excuse me, excuse me, sorry about that.

Emergency. Emergency. Sorry about that.

I need a condom.

That'll be $8.75.

All right.

What the hell? What the...?

Damn it, took Daisy's pants.

Look, I don't have any money right now, but, you know, I have somebody waiting for me, so if you could just, you know?

Next.

Wait. No. No, no, no, no.

Uh, look, what about that box of condoms right there, man?

They're practically open, right?

How about you just slide one out and throw a brother a loosie?

Next.

Come on.

Hey, everybody.

What's up?

My name is Winston Bishop, and I am in desperate need... of a condom.

Okay, that's it.

Now hear me out.

Okay? Okay.

Come on. Sorry, folks.

Hey, Schmidt?

Hello, Schmidt? You okay?

Who? Me?

Yeah.

Yeah, look, guys, I'm fine.

Look, I admit, at first I was thrown, but I'm fine.

Are you seriously doing this?!

I can't believe this! This is so dumb!

I'm sorry.

I'm just... I'm trying to process this whole thing.

Nick, you're my best friend, and you should have told me.

And Jess, what do you think? Mono is just some sort of joke?

Nothing has changed.

Like same old, same old.

Except for the fact that, uh, pre-kiss Jess didn't have a parking spot.

Post-kiss Jess does.

Sounds... like... change.

I won the spot fair and square, Schmidt.

Did you, though?

I wouldn't say fair and square.

All right. Fine.

I used my body. Is that what you want to hear?

I shook what the good people of Oregon gave me, and I got a parking space.

Let me tell you something, Nicholas Miller.

You know, had Winston kissed me, you're the first person I would have told!

I know you would have told me if Winston kissed you.

But I guess your loyalty lies elsewhere.

I can't handle this!

Fine. Schmidt, congratulations.

The spot is yours.

Okay. Really.

It's him.

What?! Nick Miller, you weakling.

I can't have people thinking my decision wasn't above board.

This city can't have another scandal!

Wise choice.

Thanks.

He's been manipulating you the whole time.

Look at him.

I don't think...

Look at his smi ... he's smiling evilly.

You know what, Jess? Stop.

You're manipulating me, he's manipulating me, and I'm getting confused.

I am the decider of us three!

I decide!

Let the decider decide!

I am not the suggester!

I'm not having a good time with this game.

Give my regards to Outside Dave.

Stay away from my space...

or you'll have this to deal with.

S...

Where are your nipples, man?

I'll never tell.

You're either gonna break your finger, or you're gonna break that button.

I'm not going back in there. It's too weird.

You're the one making it weird, Nick.

You want weird? I'll give you weird.

Weird, weird, weird.

Fine. Weirder, weirder, weirder.

Weird, weird, weird.

Uh, weird, right, ugh.

Weird.

Weird. Weird.

Weird, weirder, weird.

Weird, weird.

Weird, weird.

Weird.

Weird! Weird. Weird!

What are we doing?!

I don't know! You started it!

Is this how it's gonna be? Is it?

What are we talking about, Jess?

You think things like this aren't gonna come up all the time?

We need a long-term solution.

I'll give you a long-term solution.

I'm taking the spot!

Oh, my God.

What is all the commotion?

He's taking the spot!

He can't do that!

k*ll him, k*ll him ... you said you'd k*ll him!

Now k*ll him! Now's your chance!

Oh, for heaven's sakes.

First car in the spot gets it.


Aah!

Aw, damn it!

You middled me again?!

I'm not to be middled; It's in my contract.

sh**t!

Excuse me.

Aah!

Hey, five bucks if you help me fold this nicely.

I'm not going above six, so don't negotiate with me.

Aah!

Go, go, sorry, go.

Oh, I'm sorry, I ... okay, sorry, go.

Move it, you wacky bitch!

It won't start.

Help me push it!

Get behind it.

Back in the box!

Aw, cats.

Hey, hey, buddy.

What?

Mine.

The laws of parking require a vehicle.

This is my vehicle.

This is my vehicle.

Don't.

Don't you do it, Schmidt.

I'm not afraid.

Schmidt, no.

You just h*t me.

Damn right I did.

You're sitting right in the middle of the spot.

You h*t me with your car over a parking spot, Schmidt.

Get out of the spot!

Jess.

Move or I will h*t you. I want that spot.

No.

Have you lost your mind?

Not a joke, move, move.

No.

What are you doing, Jess?

Move, move.

Jess, stop it.

What are you doing? Stop the car, you lunatic. She's insane.

No ... oh!

O-h!

No, no!

What is she doing?

What is going on?

Can't believe I'm going down like this.

You're not in the space!

Okay, all right, mine, mine, I'm not leaving.

I'm not leaving either.

I have a purse full of hard candy and an empty bladder.

I'm here all night, folks.

I'm here all night.

I'm here all night.

I'm here all night.

I ... that's what I said.

I'm really happy you gave me another sh*t.

Yeah, so am I.

You know, you, you can't judge someone based on their friends.

No, and I feel like, if you gave them another chance, you'd really like them.

They are down to earth and chill, no drama.

Yeah?

Hey, Cece, it's Winston!

You got a rubber?!

I need a rubber.

He said "rhubarb," that's how he pronounces "rhubarb"

It's so weird.

Nah, nah, I-I need a condom for my penis!

What are you doing?

Okay, we're not close enough for this.

Alright, we have spent very little time together.

You are the only person that I know in this neighborhood.

Don't you dare come in my house.

Hey, man, hey.

Hey.

I'm Winston, good to see you again.

Shivrang, Hi.

You got a condom on you?

Oh, no, no, look that's not, We're, um...

Her mother and my mother...

I'm a chemical engineer.

Winston, Look, Shivrang, man to man, I know you have a condom in your wallet, but my question to you is: Do you actually think you' gonna get lucky with a a sexy lady like that?

You know, I feel like I'm getting lucky by just being here.

Be honest with me.

Ok, fine, I've got a condom.

Aha!

Winston.

Is he going to need that condom tonight?

Oh, God.

I'm gonna punch you in the face.

Shall I give you a minute to think about it?

'Cause I can wait.

I'm gonna wring your damn neck.

This is awful, like, really...

Okay, okay. Get out.

This is worse than last time.

Honestly, physically removing you now.

I'm going.

Out of my house.

It's a sour ball, not a bank safe.

Just open the candy.

Are you hungry?

Yes, I'm starving.

Why don't you go upstairs to the kitchen?

It's full of food.

Just give me the damn candy.

Go get it.

Wait, no, no, no.

Aah.

Okay, I have, like, a s*ab pain, it's ...

and it's, and it's like right here.

It's my pishy.

I, I have to pish.

I think we should take a break.

Leave and you're out.

Drown in your own urine.

I got to find a condom.

I need a condom!

But I still want the spot.

Come on, come on, come on, Nick, come on.

Okay.

Condom, condom, condom.

Damn it.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Here we go... here we go.

I mean, she's either having crazy amounts of sex or she does not know how to use these things.

Oh, just focus, man, bring it in.

Absorb it.

Yeah.

Did you just pee inside your body?

Yes.

This is your fault, Nick.

You compromised the whole loft.

We had an agreement.

When Jessica Day signed that lease, you, me, and Coach all took a no-nail oath.

No-nail oath?

I didn't break the no-nail oath.

Your mouth nailed her mouth.

For the record, no one nailed my mouth.

That's important to me.

Also, we didn't do anything wrong.

Do you know nothing about men?

Yeah, I know nothing about men.

That's why I'm wearing a short skirt and wool tights.

A woman cannot be in close quarters with three men and kiss one of them.

What fuels men?

Competition and sex.

That's why the United Nations was formed, that's why girls aren't allowed on pirate ships, and that is why there is a no-nail oath in apartment 4D, and deep down inside, Nick knows that I'm right.

Mm-hmm, back me up here, Nick.

I just want a piece of candy.

Are you serious? You didn't give me the spot and now you won't back me up?

You coward.

Why should he?

Because he ... because...

Because, what, you kissed, and now he owes you some sort of emotional support and loyalty?

Reason number two for the no-nail oath ...

bitches be crazy.

Isn't that right, Nick?

I found garbage that has chocolate on it.

Daisy, I'm back.

Daisy.

Hey, Daisy, I'm here! Where you at?!

I don't have my phone, and all these buildings look alike, and I...

Hey, Daisy!

You know Daisy?

Shut up.

No? All right, okay, cool.

Now, I walked around with "yum"

on my butt all day.

I deserve sex ... protected sex.

Daisy...!

Schmidt's right.

I thought we could go back to the way things were, but we can't.

You nailed my mouth...

and you nailed it good and hard and strong.

Now things have changed.

Okay, but they don't have to have changed.

It's just different, Nick, it is.

That kiss was the dumbest mistake I have ever made ...

dumber than Caroline, dumber than law school, dumber than when I thought it was pronounced

"Brock Omabrama."

What?

I thought his name was pronounced

"Brock Oma..."

It's not...

If I could go back in time and take back the kiss, I would.

I would take it back, I regret it.

Congratulations, you're the proud owner of a new parking spot.

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

Jess, wait.

You realize, every second that you don't run after her, you become more and more of a buttwad, don't you?

Did you pee yourself?

That I did, that I did.

Jess.

Hi.

Hey, look...

Why you holding a box of fish sticks?

Because I'm going to go scare the feral cats away that live in my current parking spot, Nick.

I'm going to throw fish sticks at them while singing "Memory," and don't you dare criticize me.

I don't regret kissing you.

I regret what it did, I regret that it made things weird.

We are roommates, you know, we got to figure this out, Jess.

A no-nail oath?

You thought I was going to sleep with one of you, like I just couldn't help it?

It was me, Jess, I couldn't help it.

You dropped your fish sticks.

Shut up, Nick.

Ay, ay, ay.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

We're having a conversation.

Will you please get out of here?

Yeah, well, that's the problem, isn't it?

Because I live here, too, and I'm gonna be here when all of this goes to crap.

Next time you guys have your dirty little thoughts about each other, you better be thinking about me, too, because I ain't going nowhere.

You are literally sitting in a puddle of your own pee.

The apartment 4D no-nail oath right here:

"We, the undersigned,

"Agree never to nail our roommate Jessica Day

"unless the sex can be parlayed into a business that provides for all parties involved."

What?

I didn't read the fine print.

"If one of the undersigned nails said female, well, then all must nail her."

What?!

I didn't know there was fine print.

What, what?!

I didn't know there was fine...

Let me be very clear here ... I am a strong, self-sufficient woman, and I will not be nailing you, Schmidt, or Nick or Schmidt.

Notice I said that twice because I don't feel it's sinking in.

There will be no nails or screws or hammers in this building area generally, the whole thing.

What, do you think that I want to do this?

Believe me, pass.

I just don't want my home turning into a den of sexual tension and lies.

Now, do you want things to go back to normal or not?

Yes.

Yes, I do, but I...

Then, I just have to kiss you.

This is just one of those things ... let's just do it...

No, I-I...get past it, we move on.

I think that's a bad idea.

Nick, you're into this, right?

I don't know, might help.

Are you serious?

I don't know.

Okay, fine, just get over here and do it and do it fast.

I'll be a hero.

Bring it on.

Mmm...

Aah.

Ooh.

No.

No.

Mistake.

It was really a mistake.

A big mi ... I made it weirder.

Is everyone in the world having sex but me?!

Old people, foreigners, nerds.

Everyone's banging.

Schmidt and Jess?!

Everyone is out there getting and giving except for old Winnie.

Look at me ...

a man who has absolutely nothing.

I left my phone, my wallet, and my dignity at Daisy's house.

I even left my pants there ... look at this.

Yum.

Yum.

I need a win, damn it, I need a win.

You need a win, pal.

Yeah.

It's a little tight in here.

Are you sure this isn't too tight?

Okay, um...

Uh-uh, this ain't gonna work.

This ain't gonna work for me.

Uh, I'm stuck.

Guys, hey, guys.

Hey, where y'all...?

Guys... guys...

Guys!

Hello?

(Whispers):
Oh, my God!  

(Sighs)  

(Snoring)  

Oh, you kissed her! You idiot!  

You...  

(Groans)  

(High-pitched gasp)  

No, no, no.
(Muffled shrieking)  

I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't. No, no, no.   

I wasn't doing anything,
I wasn't doing anything, I...   

(Whispering):
Do not walk away from me.   

Do not. You are not.   

You're doing it. Nick?   

- Shamone.
- He did.   

(Sighs)   

(Yawning)   

(Both yawning loudly)   

Oh.   

Ugh, my God.   

Oh, I just woke up.   

I've been sleeping
for hours and hours.   

Nice. Me, too.   

Let's see here.   

Oh, sweet. Ten e-mails.   

Hey, Sam, um...   

I have to tell
you something.   

How do you always look
so beautiful in the morning?   

Sometimes I can't
even look at you.   

I can't even--
I got to look away.   

I can't even look
at you right now.   

Wait, but I got to.
Now I got to look away.   

I just can't resist.
Oh, geez.   

(Laughs)   

What were you gonna say?   

Nothing.   

It was nothing.   

Jess?   

Nick kissed me.   

Wha...?!   

âª Who's that girl? âª   

âª Who's that girl? âª   

âª It's Jess. âª   

(Whistles)   

(Groans):
Oh, man. Okay.   

I had the best sex of
my life last night.   

Winston, I'm glad you're here.
We need to talk.   

Yeah. Daisy said I was
pretty good.   

You hear that?
Pretty good!   

This is important.   

And I ain't even use my hands.   

You didn't use your hands?   

Well, just I did a lot
of side stuff.   

Okay, Winston,
you're k*lling me.   

I really need to talk to you,   

and now after hearing that,
I can barely look at you.   

Well, I got
my mojo back, baby!   

I'm the Mojo Man!   

Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
I like the sound of that.   

Yeah, we're not gonna be
getting to my thing, are we?   

(Whispers):
Mo-Mo-Mojo Man.   

I got to tell Sam.   

I can't tell Sam!   

I didn't even do anything wrong!   

Nick kissed me!   

I didn't even kiss him back!   

Okay, fine!
I kissed him back!   

Is that what
you want me to say?   

I literally
haven't said a word   

for, like, over an hour.
(Groans)   

And now he won't
even talk to me,   

'cause I saw him this morning   

and he just panic
moonwalked away from me.   

- He what?
- He does that sometimes.   

Man. Terrorism.   

And then... ha!   

Nick just... He just...   

Kisses you.   

Stupid Nick Miller. (Grunts)   

How was it? Was it...?   

I was like Scarlett O'Hara   

in my freaking curtain dress...   

How did he do it?   

- He just, like, grabbed me.
- Uh-huh.   

- And he just took me.
- Oh, yeah.   

I mean, he was a man
and I was a woman.   

- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It was firm, but tender.   

- Oh, damn.
- Yeah, I mean,   

I saw thorough space and time
for a minute,   

but that's not the point.   

Oh, man!   

Are you okay?   

I miss sex!   

I've been on dates set up by
my mother for the past month.   

- Mm.
- I mean, what are you gonna do?   

(Groans)
I mean, do you...   

like Nick?   

Ah! Bah!   

Mm-hmm.
(Laughs)    

Nah! Neh?    

(Giggles):
Nick?    

(Laughs)    

No.    

(Chuckles)    

I don't like Nick.    

- Mm-hmm.
- I like Sam, 'cause    

Sam's the kind of guy
who fixes things    

that you didn't even know
were broken.    

And Nick is the
type of guy    

who breaks things... that are...    

He breaks things!    

Look at that.
It's for my grandma.    

Wow, that's... oh, no.    

- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you-- Nick!    

- No, let me just...
- Nick, Nick, what are you...?    

- Okay, here, it's fine.
- No!    

Nick, what are you...?    

I think those
belong back on it.    

He is not getting in the way
of me and Sam.    

He is not ruining this.    

- Mm.
- So mad at him.    

I can't even be around him.    

Can I just spend
the day with you?    

Oh.    

Well, um...    

Okay, I didn't tell you this
before, actually, but, uh...    

SCHMIDT:
Cece is going to 

an Indian marriage
convention today    

to find herself
a brown husband.    

Now, little
does she know    

that I have signed up
for the same convention.    

Gentlemen, there is
nothing that says    

white men need not apply.    

You look like
the fortune teller in Big. 

Wait a second,
is it in the loft?    

Yes, Nick.    

The West Coast's premiere
Indian singles event,    

where     eligible
Rajput Indians get together    

to see if they should get
arranged-married to each other,    

is in our loft.    

So if it's not,
then I'm coming with.    

I'm in, Schmidty.
You finally got company.    

- I'm coming. Let's do it.
- The Mojo Man is in, too.    

Mojo Man, Mojo Man.    

Okay, neither of you are coming.    

I've been studying up
for a full week.    

I can actually speak
conversational Hindi.    

If that conversation is:
"Hello." "Hello."    

"Samosa?"
"Yes, please, Samosa."    

"More towels?"
"Do you know where    

the white person's
toilet is?"    

After that,
it gets very confusing.    

Can you drive in that dress?    

You're right, I can't.    

- All right, you're driving. Let's go.
- Yeah!    

Hi, I'm-I'm checking in.    

My name's Cecilia Parikh.    

This is my best friend.    

She's just, she's just
here to watch.    

All must participate.    

We've had a lot of
trouble with watchers.    

You participate
or you go home.    

All right, you know what?
What the hell.    

You're going to have to
fill out a questionnaire.    

Information,
education, resume.    

(Chuckles)    

Done.    

Thank you.    

(Gasps)    

What the hell are
you guys doing here?    

You look like a character
from The Love Guru. 

Aw, thank you.    

Hello.    

I'd like to check in
with my two friends here.    

Look, we are not Indian,
but you cannot turn us away,    

because I read the Website
vigorously, kumari. 

- Oh, God.
- That means "miss."    

My friend right there?    

Yeah, he's a vakeel.
That means "lawyer."    

I dropped out
of ka-heel school.    

SCHMIDT:
It's vakeel, man.    

What are you doing here?    

Oh, no. I just-- uh, yeah...    

Oh!    

Nick, you're
embarrassing me.    

WINSTON: Nick,
what are you doing?    

WINSTON:
Nick, Nick.    

N-N-N-Nick, what
are you doing?    

Stop moonwalking, man.
(Groans)    

Man, you have been
weird all morning.    

Hey, look, I kissed Jess.    

Say what you're gonna say.    

(Groans):
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!    

Whoo!    

I thought that's
what you were gonna say.    

I don't want a new roommate.    

Look, don't...
She's not moving out.    

I'm not talking about her.
Hell no, not her!    

I'm talking about you.    

When this thing bl*ws
up in your face--    

and it will blow up
in your face, Nick--    

you're the one moving out.    

You think I like
living with you?    

You have centipedes
living under your bed!    

- Those weren't centipedes.
- You've named your testicles,    

- and they're both named Sharon.
- Yeah, so what?    

I can't believe you kissed Jess!
Man, what were you thinking?    

Look, man, I wasn't
thinking anything.    

Nick, just apologize and
make it right, all right?    

All right.
That's what I'm gonna do.    

(Groans)    

Oh, Sharon!    

- Get! Just...
- Get...?    

Get over here now.    

Wait. What?    

You told me you had moved on.    

Only people who haven't moved
on say things like that.    

I'm a squirrel.
You're my nut.    

Winter's coming. I'm gonna
store you in my cheek, girl.    

Please leave.    

You and I not being together
does not make sense to me.    

I miss your body    

and the things I
used to do to it.    

- Schmidt.
- I'm talking about sex.    

Today is about me finding
someone within my own culture    

that I can build my life with.    

It's about more than sex.    

Our sex was about
more than sex.    

It was about
history and memory    

and thousands of years
of colonial suffering    

all being released in one
moment of pure ecstasy.    

Then why did the sex
always end with you yelling,    

"Blammo, that happened"?    

Blammo.    

Thank you.    

Hey.    

Oh, you can walk
normally now, I see.    

I'm sorry I kissed you.    

Well, oh, wow.    

That was unexpected.    

Thanks, Nick.    

- You know what, it was a mistake.
- I feel better.    

- 'Cause, yeah, I was feeling awkward.
- Yeah, good.    

(Chuckles):
Right.    

You were acting
a little bit weird,    

but honestly, for me,
it was, like, a nothing kiss.    

You know, it was like
kissing a cousin.    

It was so nonsexual
and nothing.    

Well... I think it
meant something.    

You know, to you,
'cause you kissed me.    

Mm-mm.    

I think you can admit it
meant something to you, Nick.    

Oh, no, I-I'm telling you,
it meant nothing to me.    

- I think it did.
- No, no.    

I do things
I don't mean all the time.    

Like this. You see this?
Bottle of water.    

Why did I do that?
I don't know.    

It doesn't mean anything.    

I think you can admit that
it meant something to you.    

- Hey, Jessica, it didn't.
- Hmm.    

It was a drinking game,
and I was finishing the game.    

Yeah, but it happened
after the game    

when it meant something.    

- Oh, so it meant something to you?
- What?    

- It meant something to you.
- No, don't...    

If you think some
stupid, terrible kiss...    

- You're thinking about
it right now!      - No!    

- I'm calling Sam and...
- Oh, you're calling Sam right now?    

He's gonna come here
and pick me up,    

- and, uh, we're leaving.
- Oh, you are?    

Why are you running away?
Because it meant something?    

We're not going anywhere.    

Meant nothing, Nick!    

HOST (Over speaker): Please look
at the numbers on your name tags    

and go to the table
with the corresponding numbers.    

These are your groupings.    

People with similar resumes
and education backgrounds    

have been grouped together.    

  ,   , thir...    

Table   !    

We're at the same table!    

- So this is rock bottom.
- I mean, call me crazy,    

but I think we're all
getting married tonight.    

- Yeah, um...   - The money table
right here, Table   !    

Hi, excuse me, I think
that there's been    

just a little bit of a
mistake with the tables.    

Over   , no advanced degrees,    

part-time employment:
Table   .    

No, see, actually, I'm-I'm
a professional model.    

I'm not famous
or anything,    

but I was in Lil
Wayne's last video.    

I was the girl he was throwing
strawberries at in slow motion.    

(Chuckles)    

Definitely Table   .    

(Sighs)    

Excuse me?    

Uh, I didn't get
assigned a table.    

Now, I know exactly
what this is about...    

But I did assign you a seat.    

This one. Lap number one.    

Okay, so this is not
a racial thing?    

Not yet, it isn't.    

Ah.    

I see what's
happening here.    

You're feeling my mojo.    

You look like a jumpy cat,
and I like that.    

Ooh, I like that.    

(Gasps)    

Like oversized
blueberries.    

(Clicks tongue)    

(Sighs)    

Mojo off. Mojo off.    

Schmidt, Table Seven,
Table Seven.    

- What're you doing? You're at Table Seven, too?
- Hmm? I'm at Table Seven.    

(Sighs)    

What?    

Well, you should feel complimented.
I feel slightly insulted.    

- What?
- No offense.    

A lot of offense taken.
Well, I'm just saying...    

- A lot.
- Jess!    

- Hi!
- Hi.    

- How are you?
- Um, okay.    

Yeah, I checked in.
Uh, they gave me my table.    

- Okay.
- This is a weird date.    

I always thought
we'd go bowling before we went    

to an Indian marriage
convention.    

- What table are you at?
- Uh, Table One, I think.    

Table One?! It's almost like
you save lives or something.    

Oh, wait, you do.    

Let's start the icebreakers.    

This exercise shows
how physically compatible    

two people can be.    

Ow! My hand!    

What?    

Stupid man.    

Nice.    

- Yeah.
- Ready?    

Three, two, ow.    

- Ow! No, no. Let's...
- Up?    

- No, you go down.
- All right. I go down?    

Kind of just got
to get in a little closer.    

JESS:
Okay, I'm trying.    

Seriously.    

Hey, dummy.    

Stop pointing your finger at me.
That's so annoying.    

Why are you drinking my beer?    

You point that finger at me
one more time, I'm...    

Why don't you just admit that
that kiss meant something to you?    

- No, no!   - I could tell it meant
something, so admit it    

or I'll do this all day.
I'll do it all day.    

HOST:
Next challenge: Make a table    

out of nothing
but newspaper and tape.    

Women look to your left,
men to the right.    

These are your partners.    

Oh, you got to
be kidding me.    

First table that can hold
a phone book wins.    

All right, so we have
to make a table.    

Okay.    

- Give me the tape.
- No.    

I'll tell you what's not
made out of newspaper,    

that tight little
ass of yours.    

Jess, you liked kissing me!
It's fine to say that.    

No, I didn't.
I'm not on my knee asking you    

to marry me; It was a nice kiss.    

You were like a dog and my mouth    

was like a bowl full of
dog... milk!    

It was like a damn fairy tale,
that kiss!    

It was the best kiss
of your life.    

- Are you serious, Nick?
- And you have to take    

a little responsibility,
tarting around in that    

- little soft pink robe, not expecting
to get kissed.   - Tarting around?    

I'm a man, Jessica!    

- What?
- Pink robes are my catnip.    

And we have a winning couple!    



BOTH:
We are not a couple!    

- We're not a couple.
- And this is a very bad table.    

- Terrible table.
- And stop clapping, everybody.    

- This is awful.
- Look. It won't hold anything.    

Be prepared to laugh!    

No, I mean,
this is, like...    

NICK:
I got it, I got it.    

Here, put it down.
Just-- okay.    

Very weak table.    

Break!    

It's a strong table.    

Strong table, strong couple.    

Come on. Jump up, yeah.
Jump up! Jump up! Jump up!    

- Whoa! Come on.
- Wow.    

- Wow, yeah. It's real, man.
- Come on.    

That's an impressive table!    

Congratulations on winning the
table-building competition, baby.    

- Yeah, it didn't mean anything, so...
- I didn't think it meant anything.    

- Yeah, no, just--
- Nick just drives me crazy.    

- It's like-- you know?
- Yeah, I mean, I never...    

- Well, yeah, that's just...
- That's what I was saying.    

Is there something
I should know here?    

No. 'Cause...
(Bell dings)    

HOST:
Men, switch seats!    

No. Sam, stop.    

'Cause...
No, I want to talk to you.    

- Sam, I...
- Do you like field hockey?    

I... Yeah. Yeah.    

- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie. Pass.    

So, when did you decide
to become a model?    

Oh. Didn't really
think about it at all.    

Someone just said they'd pay me
for being pretty, so...    

- I like your hat.
- Shh.    

- It's my favorite color.
- Shh...    

- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.    

So how many children
do you want?    

Well, I have to start soon, so
I guess I'll just jump right in.    

So, do you think through
any of your decisions    

or do you always just
do whatever you want?    

Hey! M. Night Shyamalan.    

I got a twist ending
for you: Shut up.    

- What do you want, Table Seven?
- Schmidt, just talk to your girl.    

- Hi!
- You better watch it, buddy.    

'Cause I will, I will
Cal-cut-a-bitch up in here.    

- I will Cal-cut-a-bitch.
- Schmidt!    

Don't worry, Ben Affleck.
I'm not desperate.    

I don't date below Table Six.
(Bell dings)    

HOST:
Time's up. Switch places.    

Sam...    

That was not nice.
He crossed a line.    

Schmidt, you said
you would leave me alone.    

- You said you would leave...
- He crossed a line.    

You said you would
leave me alone.    

(Chuckles)    

Funny seeing you here.    

Hey.    

You have to go.    

Yeah, you have to go over there.    

Okay. Bye-bye.    

Go now. Hi.    

Um, Sam, I do have
something to tell you.    

You know why we're at Table   ?    

'Cause we're both bad at life,
but we have model good looks.    

It's 'cause we don't
think things through.    

You didn't think it through
when you kissed Jess.    

She told me. It's like we just
make these impulsive decisions,    

and all we end up doing
is hurting other people.    

I can't believe this.    

No. No, Sam...    

Sam? Wait.    

Sam, wait.    

I'm really sorry.    

I said I wanted
to commit to this.    

I thought you understood
what that meant.    

JESS:
I do. I did.    

Hey, hey.
Sam, listen.    

JESS: What?
- Sam, hear me out.    

I kissed her, okay?    

She didn't kiss me.    

It didn't mean anything to her.    

Thank you.    

(Grunts)    

Oh, my God!    

(Groans) I'm sorry, Nick.
It's the training.    

He's in such terrible shape!
You could've k*lled him.    

(High-pitched): I'm gonna
kick your ass, man.    

SAM: Jess, it may
not have meant something    

to you, but it meant
something to me.    

Is there another doctor
in the house?!    

With this crowd, I'm sure.    

I'm done. So...    

Good-bye, Jess.    

No. Sam.    

Ice it,    hours.    

And keep it elevated.    

- He even exits cool.
- Oh, God.    

Anu? I got
something for you.    

Now, this is Freddy.    

As you can see,
he has the exact    

same build as me,
all right?    

And he is totally available.
Ain't that right, Freddy?    

That is what I call
an arranged bang.    

(Makes expl*si*n noise)    

Freddy, are you scared of being
confined in small spaces?    

Oh, you'll do just fine.    

Now, just remember,
wherever you are,    

the Mojo Man is there.    

(Sighs)    

Damn it, Schmidt.    

I'm taking this.    

Excuse me. Excuse me! Hold up!    

You know, when I
came here today,    

I thought India was
a pretty cool country.    

You guys are obviously smart.    

You l-looked at the roof
of a bus and you said,    

"That's not just a roof,
that's more seating."    

Kal Penn, he's a genius.
Thank you for him.    

But what I didn't know    

is that you're a country
full of blind idiots.    

- Oh, God.
- Because in your midst    

walks a brown angel.    

That woman. Right there.    

I may be an idiot,    

but I'm smart enough
to know what I lost.    

You people could've had it all.    

And you shoved her over there
at a table with Nick.    

Get your crap together, India.    

Schmidt...    

out!    

(Crowd murmuring)    

Hello. I didn't
see you over here.    

I would love to...    

(Men murmuring)    

Sorry I didn't
see you earlier.    

SCHMIDT: Okay.
They're all-- okay.    

You don't all have
to run over there at once.    

I mean, she... she's not
that great, you guys.    

I mean, she's
kind of old.    

You should see her areolas--
one's like a helicopter pad,    

the other one's
like a, you know, like...    

like a tick bite.    

It's freaky. Very disorienting.    

âª It feels
like a perfect night âª    

NICK: Is this making
you feel better at all?    

âª At midnight, to fall
in love with strangers âª    

âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª    

âª Yeah, we're happy,
free, confused âª    

âª And lonely at the same time âª    

I just wanted to listen
to Taylor Swift alone!    

âª Oh, yeah âª    

How's that?    

You know when you get dumped and
you're, like, racking your brain    

for what was it
that I did wrong?    

Well, this is a really
unique situation    

in that I don't have to do that.    

Well, what happened?
(Music stops)    

I'm sorry. I know what--
I know that it's my fault.    

I didn't mean
it like...    

(Sighs)    

Jess, can I say something    

- that'll potentially not
help this situation?  - No.    

I've never been
a home-wrecker.    

And I liked it.    

I mean, Sam was
thr*at by me.    

(Chuckles)    

I mean, I see that as a victory.    

But in-in more important...    

uh, ways, a huge, huge,
devastating loss.    

For you.    

Should I call Cece?    

This feels like Cece territory.    

This isn't Nick territory.    

This is, uh...    

Look, Jess...    

I'm sorry, okay,    

that I kissed you.    

But I shouldn't have done it,    

because it was obviously
a mistake,    

and now you're crying and...    

I won't do it again.    

Well...
(Sniffles)    

maybe it was a little bit broken
to begin with.    

- What happened?
- He just...    

He always wanted
to fist bump in the morning.    

- And you didn't like that?
- I hated it. What are... what...    

- I feel like you're forgiving me.
- No.    

- I felt like before I said that
you were though. - Nope. Nope.    

Now you remembered you're
still mad at me. No? Okay.    

- All right, good night, Nick. Night.
- Okay, good night, Jess.    

Hey, Jess.    

Too soon?    

Yeah, too soon!    

Well, hey, good night.
And I'm sorry about everything.    

Okay.    

Okay, yeah.
(Chuckles)    

- That was...
- Yeah. That was...    

- a little bit weird.
- So weird.    

Let's not ever do that again.    

- Yeah.
- Do it again. Okay.    

- Good night. Night, Miller!
- Good night.    

Good night, Sergeant.    

I'm glad everything's
back to normal around here.    

Thank you for
what you said up there.    

- You know, I got a lot
of phone numbers. - Good.    

I think I'm gonna go
on a lot of dates.    

- I think that's a great thing.
Good.   - Yeah.    

The plan hasn't changed;
I am still marrying an Indian guy.    

- No, yeah, that's fine.
- Okay?    

But you went home with a Jew in
a turban, so I'm just saying.    

Just take this off.
Come on. Let's go.    

(Sighs)    

God, I have missed this.    

(Moaning)    

Turban on? Turban off?    

I'm gonna hate myself
for saying this, but...    

turban on.    

- Turban on it is.
- Uh-uh    

Taking that
magic carpet ride.    

- Yeah? No?
- Shut up! Whoo!

Ah!

Look how handsome I look.

That is a woman's coat.

This coat has clean lines... and pockets that don't quit.

And it has room for your hips.

And when I wear it, I feel hot to trot.

You're wearing a dress.

Yeah, don't say "hot to trot."

My coat makes me say things like that.

First of all, Nick, it is not your coat.

True, it was delivered to the wrong address.

But then tell me, why does it fit like a damn glove?

What is happening to you, man?

I don't know if I can give up looking this damn good ...

It's someone else's woman's coat.

Nothing?

I mean, nothing? Damn it!

I've been trying to get something going with myself for a full hour.

It's like a taffy pull on a hot summer's day.

Eww! You have the door open, Schmidt.

I'm over myself ... I just don't do it for me anymore.

I even bought myself a sexy pair of underpants to spice things up ... didn't happen.

I just laid there.

You know what? That's it.

Tonight, I start having sex again.

Now, are you two gonna join me?

Not while I'm here, please.

Is that the way you wanted to say that?

I'm in, Schmidty! I am in!

I'm gonna have sex tonight.

Yeah!

Yeah!

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

I like this feeling, you guys. I'm liking the vibe that we got going here. There's definitely gonna be some sex-having tonight.

Oh, yeah...

Damn it, there needs to be.

You know I haven't had sex since Labor Day?

I know what the problem is ... I want it too bad.

So, what's your name?

Winst... W-W-W... yeah.

You just need a confidence boost.

Good news ... I'm lousy with the stuff I got your back tonight.

And you, London Fog, you're looking hot to trot, baby.

Any chance you're gonna take that coat off?

This jacket? No way.

I'm keeping the jacket on.

Take the jacket off.

No, I'm keeping the jacket on.

No, it's fine.

Band of brothers.

Band of brothers, yeah!

The club's up... Dance, dummy.

Hey, guys. Guess what?

Sam has the late shift and Cece's on a date with some Indian guy, so world's best wing-woman reporting for duty.

Jess, you can't come.

What?

Look, I actually want to get girls tonight.

You're my cooler.

What?

All I do is help you get laid, Nick.

Maureen, did you have one very special long-time love?

Yes.

You should be with him.

I'm not your cooler.

It's not you.

It's the way that you behave.

And the things that you say.

And the look on your face.

And...

It is you.

It's just you ... you're the cooler.

I'm sorry, but you can't come with us tonight.

I get it. Um...

I just... I have, um, a lot of things I have to do.

More important stuff to do here.

I have to clean out my closet and...

Oh, yeah. - I have an ice cream maker to try out.

That's better than going to a stupid club.

It's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be great. - Shut up.

Get out of here, girl, you're missing nothing.

It's gonna get so crazy.

Come on, buddy, get in there.

Get crunk with us, bro.

Yeah-ha-ha! Yeah!

I can't believe you got us kicked out of the discotheque, Nick.

I didn't even do anything.

Damn it, Nick, take the coat off, all right? It freaks girls out.

Well, maybe they're freaked out

'cause you're not wearing a trench coat.

Yeah? Have you ever thought of that?

Okay, guys, please ...

no more friendly f*re.

All right.

Okay.

Ooh, Schmidty type.

That's a Schmidty type right there.

That's me. Yeah, yeah. Schmidty time...

I feel good. Yeah. Schmidty time.

Schmidt! Hey, dude!

What?!

What about band of brothers?

Your friendship means nothing to me.

Every man for himself.

Hey, uh...

Hey.

I was, uh...

Most... M-M...

Okay... Yeah, can you...

In the beginning...

Tap out, man. Tap out.

What happened to building my confidence, Schmidty?

You went in too soon. Get out of here.

Go.

Go.

Hey.

What's happening?

Hi.

Wow, that was embarrassing.

Yeah...

Well..

You can relax.

I'm taken.

You were very beautiful from across the bar.

I'm sorry. I'm Schmidt.

I'm sorry... we were talking, Schmidt.

What a ten, what a beautiful woman.

He works here.

As a bartender.

Yeah, I do.

February clean-out.

What do you think, Nick?

I'm bored!

No bottoms, no bottoms.

Bottoms on top!

Robot can't find clothes to fit right.

Robot can't find clothes.

I do it for Kenya.

Silver?!

Damn you, Zimbabwe.

Hello?

Hello?

Nice coat you got there.

Well, I just actually wear it 'cause it gives me confidence.

That's kind of sad.

You know what's really sad is that he stole the jacket.

It's not technically stealing.

He's still reeling from being dumped.

Aw.

He's attached to it.

Like a little bitch "bwanky."

It's not like a blanky, dude.

It looks like a "bwanky."

It's not like my "bwanky."

The only reason I'm out tonight is to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

That's not true. I'm not gonna...

Shut up, Schmidt.

I mean, I could take care of you, if you wanted.

You can what?

I love sad guys and you seem sadder than most.

I think your plan sounds okay.

When you go home at night, do you look in the mirror and just think,

"I am the worst"?

Actually yes, I do.

Yeah?

Yeah, a lot of the times.

You hate yourself?

I definitely don't like myself.

It's right on the line of hate.

What the hell is this?

I don't know how to talk to women.

Reason being, I feel like you all think that I just want one thing from you.

Mm-hmm.

I want the one thing.

But a bunch of other th... can a man just want all the things?

I mean, damn.

I like a challenge.

And you are one big challenge.

I'm Daisy.

Winston.

Sam, it's Jess.

Please come get me.

I'm probably fine, but I also might be d*ad.

Good-bye.

It's Cece, leave a message.

Cece, it's Jess ... call me back, I'm alone in the loft.

I think there's something out...

There's something sexy about a man who just needs me to make him feel better.

I honestly need you to make me feel better.

Nicholas, your phone's ringing.

Not now, Schmidt!

Hey, Jess. It's Jess.

Schmidt, stop.

You should really talk to her.

Unbelievable. I am so sad.

Nicholas, you have a phone call.

Don't do this, Schmidt, please don't.

You are the dumbest...

Would you wait one second?

I'm just... I just have to do this.

I'll be sad in a second.

Yep.

Hi.

Hi.

I'm sad.

Okay.

Uh, what is going on?

There's something at the door and you have to come home.

Cooler, Jess ... you are being a cooler right now.

Seriously, I think it might be g*ng related.

I've always been worried about my blue curtains...

Crips.

The Cri... Jess, I'm done!

Nick, I need you.

Yeah, so this is the place.

I'm really glad you're here.

The bedrooms are that way...

What are you doing, pal?

Never leave me alone again.

I'd like to introduce you to our roommate Jess.

Welcome to our home.

Jess, this loft has old pipes ...

I've told you that a million times, but you never listen during pipe talk.

Well, pipe talk's boring.

What is this?

What is what...?

You drew my face on a melon?

What else was I supposed to draw your face on?

Nothing. Don't draw my face.

Okay.

Jess, for some reason, that girl out there, she is sexually aroused by other people's misery.

Do you understand the position that puts me in?

It puts you in a really good position?

It really does. And then what happens?

Okay, I understand how, in this instance, I might have cooled things off for you.

Thank you for admitting that.

I am prepared to fix it.

'Cause, son, I'm gonna get you laid.

Okay, it's not how it is and never call me "son"

and don't talk like that.

The game is True American

Clinton rules.

Pick your interns.

I don't understand the game.

Uh, you're gonna be my intern.

It's okay, it's stripping.

It's not just stripping, it's sexy.

Okay, so what exactly are the rules?

The floor is lava, doves versus hawks.

The couch is the Mason-Dixon line.

We're not doing cabinets ... no cabinets.

No cabinet.

No cabinets.

One, two, three, four, JFK!

FDR!

Go, go ... that's the lava!

Down, down in the tunnel.

No.

I'm the President, you're the Vice President.

Joe Biden!

It's Abu n*zi!

Where?

No, no, no, no! Spin, spin, spin, spin!

Fly! Do the chicken dance!

No, no counter clock-wise?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

Holly, you're in the Amber Waves of Grain.

You have to lose your jacket.

I...

Take off your jacket; She's right.

Those are the rules.

Is there, like, a printout of the rules I can see, or...?

No!

No!

I thought this was like music...

Howard Dean Scream.

Yeah!

God...

I am sorry I was crying so much.

God, that film, it just... it just reminded me how much I want to have kids, you know?

Was that just a really weird thing to say on a first date?

No.

Are you sure? It felt a bit weird.

Oh, my best friend has texted me, like, 12 times.

I get it ... you're just trying to get out of the date.

No, no, no ... no, this is real.

It's the kids thing. I knew it.

Some psycho keeps scratching at her door and then running away.

She's pretty sure it's the Calabasas Scratcher.

I mean, is that a thing?

What?

I don't keep up with local news.

I don't know, it's fine.

You don't have to lie to me.

I get it.

You can come with me.

Okay? Then you'll see.

Well, all right.

She's just like this.

Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!

Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!

Gettysburg, Bull Run.

Oh, no, oh, no, I think I fell ... oh, no.

In the course of human events, you must...

Surrender your shirt!

Fine, I'll take off my shirt.

He did it on purpose ... he did it to impress her!

U.S.A.

I am not...

I am not a crook!

I am not a crook!

What do you mean, man?

I took my shirt off! Wait! It's part of the game, you guys!

Up, up, up. I'm up! Oh, wow!

This footstool really reminds me of my ex.

Liar! Holly, Holly, look at these ... these are my abs.

Hard to believe that I used to be a great big fat person.

Oh, fat makes me so sad.

Yeah, it makes me sad, too.

I'm chubby... I'm a fat guy.

You look great, man.

I'm a fat boy.

Feel where the fat used to be?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's been replaced with phantom fat.

I still feel it jiggle.

Hey, Schmidt, your butt just violated the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act1

Westward Ho, son! Westward Ho.

Bye-bye, Schmidt.

Damn it.

Come on, all you got to do is talk to her, what's the big deal?

Okay, mm...

You're at the bar ... I'm Holly.

Boy, am I thirsty.

I was wondering if, like...

if you want... if you want, per chance, like...

"Per chance," really?

Hm? No, it's, uh...

You're a swell kind of gal.

Getting worse.

You come on out to the bar.

Hey, girl, what your name is?

Oh, my God.

What that thing do?

Oh, my God.

Out of all the gals in this...

God... what... you walked into mine.

Please.

Um...

Yeah, take a sip.


Okay, look, I think you're amazing.

Would you like to have a drink with me?

Yes, yes, I will.

Now give me that.

This coat is an unfair advantage ... take it off.

I love the coat.

Take the coat off!

Hey, Schmidt!

Hey, hey! No!

Order! Order!

All right, there's only one way to solve this.

Two of us have to go behind the Iron Curtain, which is that door there, and kiss.

And there has to be a "clear and present thr*at of tongue."

This is why I voted for you.

Holly, you ready for this?

Definitely against the president's order.

Ready?

Let's do the count.

The two, three or four.

So when we do this, do two.

Okay. Not three, not one, not four ... two.

A one or a three. Anything but a two.

Just not a two. Two. Do you hear me? Two. Not four.

One, two, three.

What are you doing? You said not to do a two!

I made it so clear!

No...!

No...!

...brought the change in!

Mulligan! Mulligan!

Holly, wait for me! I'm very sad!

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Open the door! Open the door!

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

I can see how in this second instance I might be considered a cooler...

if you want to label me.

You think?

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Okay, we kissed. Let us out. Sent you a picture.

That ain't no kiss, man!

Come on, Inspector Gadget, inspect those tonsils.

Just give Jess a tender, sensual kiss, and we will let you right out.

Shut up, Schmidt!

Schmidt, stay out of this!

Please stop yelling at me!

You know that I'm ten percent more emotionally fragile than Nick right now.

No, no, don't! No, please!

Don't! Don't!

Do you mind if I tell you a story?

Is it sad?

Holly, he's really happy!

He's got a 401K and a six-pack!

Well, it's the tale of an uber successful marketing executive's journey...

I'm hairy and chubby!

...into heartbreak.

Mm-hmm.

Her name was Cecelia.

No!

Come on, come on. Holly, wait!

Ugh! What is the big deal?

Let's just suck it up and French a little.

Okay, fine, but don't say

"Let's suck it up and French a little."

Okay, fine. Let's do this.

What were you doing?!

Well, I thought you're sitting on the ground.

No. I... Okay.

Uh!

Okay, Jess, hey, this is not a big deal.

Okay, not a big deal. Let's just do it.

Fine. Let's just do it.

Okay. Great, yeah.

Let's just do it.

Okay, cool.

Why are you licking your lips?

Should I not? Do you want dry lips? - No.

Then I'm just licking 'em to make 'em better.

Okay.

Fine.

Do it.

I'm doing it.

Fine, then do it.

Are you a tongue-er?

Am I a tongue-er?

I don't want to put my tongue in your mouth, if you don't like it.

Just kiss me!

Okay, all right, great.

That's what I'm gonna do.

All right.

Ready?

Yeah.

One, two... I'm actually not gonna do a count.

Okay.

That's not my style when I kiss.

I don't count down before...

Okay.

I don't think so.

Okay.

Ready?

Yep.

I'm sorry. You can't do that.

What did I do?

Your face.

My face?

Yeah, you can't do that with your face.

Okay, I'll do something different with my face.

Okay, all right, great.

Wait ... you can't kiss with your teeth!

Okay, I can't ... no, I can't do this.

Well, you can't try to kiss me like a Joker and expect...

Okay, you're... let me out of here!

Let me out! Sometimes, I hear her name when the wind bl*ws.

Please!

Open the door! Cece.

You know, I left something behind in the desert that day:

My faith and true love...

and my future biracial child.

You, you kind of lost me there.

Not really doing it for me.

It's more depressing than sad.

It's not depress...

It's depressing.

It's sort of depressing.

No, no, no, it's not depressing.

It's not really doing it for me.

I'm gonna tell you why it's not depressing.

Because she is still in love with me.

I'm over it completely.

Having said that, it's so hard to move on.

Do-do you know what I mean?

Yes.

Can you help me move on, Holly?

You need help moving.

Can you heal my pain?

I can heal your pain.

Can you ple...

I can heal you.

Yeah, you can heal my...

Hey, Jess? Where's Jess? Jess, where are you? I came as fast as I can.

Cece, open the door!

Cece, don't worry! I'm just trapped I need to k*ll Schmidt!

Until I kiss Nick!

What?

You're the... She's the Cece?

Right there, in the flesh.

You are obsessed!

Cece, honey, you have to move on, okay?

You can't love somebody forever.

I'm sorry. You love that small shiny man?

No!

What do you mean, small, man?

None of this is true.

No, because I'm on a date.

Should we make out to make him jealous or something?

Are you lying to me? I really hate being lied to.

I would never lie to you. I haven't lied to you this whole time we've been in this loft ... that's a fact.

Cece, uh...

Hey.

...please tell me, in front of Holly, how much you still love me.

I'm sorry. Is this why we came here?

Please, I don't really know what that accent is. - English.

I speak English. That didn't sound like English.

It will be my final request, I promise, so both of us can move on.

'Cause I, you know, I'd really like to move on. - I get it.

I'd like to move on all night long with Holly.

Okay, I get it.

I'm only gonna say this one more time.

I always have and always will...

love you.

All right, all right, you know, this is the most elaborate way to get out of dating me that I've ever experienced, so...

Winny, it's Nicky.

Open the door, man!

I guess the game's over.

I thought we were working together.

I was gonna start on your confidence and work my way up to your facial hair.

What's your fiancÃ©

gonna say about that?

Oh, this? I just wear it so guys don't h*t on me in bars.

Okay.

I'm single.

What are you gonna do about it, huh?

I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

Okay, I'm waiting.

Um, so...

Still waiting.

Don't say anything!

She sounds weird! Just let us out!

Just open the door.

Yeah.

C minus. You kiss like a damn bitch.

Oh, you're messing with me; Okay.

Little bit.

Nick, I'm gonna admit it.

I might be your cooler.

I chalk it up to bad timing.

Well, thank you for admitting that.

But to be fair, you are your own cooler

70% of the time.

Some basic grooming, Nick, and you'd be smoking hot.

I'd be smoking hot?

You'd be smoking hot.

You do want to kiss me, then.

All bets are off if you take a shower.

That is very nice of you.

Jess, are you okay? I got your message!

What's happening?

Sam, I'm so sorry. Yeah... here, I'll help you up. I'll help you up.

It was a false alarm.

All right.

What are you doing back there?

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Okay, let's just do this already.

Just kiss me.

No, I'm not gonna kiss you.

Kiss me!

Jess, stop!

God! Miller, just kiss me already!

No, not like this!

That, that...

What? What does that mean?

No, I didn't...

Nothing. I just, I didn't mean it like that.

I just, we can't like that because that's not... Do you know, like...?

It's very, like, you don't...

That's not what it...

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

If you'll excuse me.

Nick, what are you doing?

What are you do...?

I'm fine.

Nick!

I just have to move this, right here ... my back. Aah!

Okay, this makes sense.

What are you doing?!

I just need a little air...

What are you doing?!

This is what I needed. This is... Ah-ha-ha!

Nick, you don't have to kiss me!

Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

Help! Help me!

I made a very bad mistake!

Nick, no! No!

Help me open this window! Help!

Don't jump!

Hold it right there!

You scared me half to death out there.

Are you not getting enough attention?

I'm fine! I am fine!

You wouldn't let me out.

I was partly joking!

Nick, we will talk about this in the morning.

Yes, we will. But first...

I'm gonna go do stuff with a girl.

Yeah!

I'm sorry.

I'm glad you're okay.

I'm fine. I'm just, I got...

Hey, Nick, if you ever feel the urge to jump again, you call me.

Thank you.

I am genuinely afraid of her.

I wish you didn't do that.

Close the door.

Thank you.

That was freakin' hilarious!

I mean, Jess, he jumped out on a ledge instead of kissing you.

Can you believe that?

I'm an idiot.

Well, he's missing out.

You want to go to bed?

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Nick!

The scratching's back.

All right, all right.

Jess, I'll take care of it.

Relax.

There's nobody there.

Admiral! Brian!

Admiral Hornbeck! Brian, down!

Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

Sometimes he gets out... Is that my coat?

What...?

I thought my package was delivered here.

It's her coat.

I was knocking and knocking.

Are you sleeping in it?!

I think he might have been.

Why?!

'Cause it's a fantastic coat.

It gives me confidence.

Man, that is a woman's coat.

What are you doing?

All right, well, this is not the...

Give her the coat, Nick.

I love this coat.

So much weird crap happens in this apartment.

He's really sorry.

God!

Well, I guess the old Nick is back, huh?

Yeah. I'm gonna miss Trench Coat Nick.

He was pretty great.

I might miss him.

I liked him.

He had guts.

It was a woman's coat.

Good night, Nick.

Good night.

I meant something like that.

Oh, uh, hey, babe, do you mind if I, uh, put this somewhere else?

It's kind of, it's kind of creeping me out when I'm trying to go to sleep.

Yeah, that's fine.

Cool.

That's fine.

Whew.

Oh, Cece. Are you two kids back together?

She wishes.

No, plumbing's out ... severe clogging.

I'm sorry I asked.

This is what happens.

Four models with protein deficiencies, sharing a shower.

They shed like a... like a four-dollar Christmas sweater.

Guys, guess what?

I just made a breakthrough with a student.

Yeah, it's true.

Don't, please.

Uh, Jess?

You know we love you, we all support you...

âª I'm breaking through with students. âª

...but when you do things like this, I'm sorry... bowl.

Okay.

It's just not satisfying.

I think it is.

Okay.

You said you had a breakthrough.

It's just a whole new world teaching adults.

This week, I gave them an assignment.

I said write whatever you want just load it up with descriptive imagery.

My fluffy pillow, my yellowy fluffy pillow, next to my dog, my hairy dog, my beloved hairy dog, while I diddle myself.

Excellent.

He was a merman.

He was the last of his kind, and he needed a mother for his mer-child.

He was not a mer-gentleman.

Can't wait to hear more.

I just can't connect with them and I don't know why.

Look, Jess, you can't teach people how to write.

Not true.

I say that as a writer.

Also not true.

A writing class is for somebody who doesn't think lyrically in terms of, like, poetic words that just... are strung...

You said you had a breakthrough.

So I have this student whose name is Edgar and he was not getting it.

And then today he turned in this amazing story.

Nick, actually, you should read this.

Writers don't read ... we write.

Jessica Day calls it

"A must read."

Look at that font.

What is this amateur hour?

At least use Palatino.

Good evening, everyone.

Or should I say morning?

Hey, Winston.

Do you guys have any agave?

We might have some pressed lentil syrup in the mixin's cabinet.

Thank you.

Oh, my goodness.

Okay, uh...

Okay, you know what?

Hey, look...

I just felt the side, the side anyway, so it's...

I didn't mean to...

It's fine, it's...

Other way, now.

I will fight you, Jack.

No, not again.

Not... no!

No!

Jump out the way, Jessica?

What the hell is wrong with you just waving that thing around like an idiot?

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey here Guys, listen to this.

"By day, I'm a plumber.

By night, I'm a stalker."

You read it.

"I sit in the bushes wearing a gimp costume, stalking my prey."

He's the first person I got to use first person narrative.

âª I'm an amazing teacher.

Very engaging, keep going.

I'm hooked.

Okay, "My prey is a deer.

"Her eyes are big, too big.

"Before she can blink those big eyes,

"I'm s*ab her.

"I s*ab and s*ab.

I love s*ab."

Sounds like he likes s*ab.

"After all the s*ab..."

It's repetitive, but...

"...I wash my hands in her dark red blood"?!

Listen to that detail.

This man is psychotic.

It's fiction.

There's no such thing as a gimp costume.

No, gimp costume's a real thing.

That's a real thing.

You've seen me in one before.

I just don't think you should be in a room with this creep, twice a week.

It is not safe.

Are you worried about me, Miller?

Yeah, I'm a little worried about you.

And if you won't do anything about it, then I'm taking into my own hands.

I'm doing a little investigation.

Investigating? Please.

You're just gonna Google his name.

I am way beyond that.

You're typing his name into Google.

We can all see the screen. See the screen, dude.

This is a private investigation!

Are you... I wanted to talk to you about the...

regrettable contact between Cece's...

her-her down there and my, uh...

my parts.

You practically shish-kebabbed her.

Is this something I should apologize for?

Just let it go, man.

You pogo'd her.

I'm sorry, what did you say, "pogo"?

I didn't, um...

I heard

"Pogo" ... what is that?

Look, Winston, fine.

It's what we call what you did this morning, okay?

It's a short... it's a shorthand.

Why do you have a shorthand, Schmidt, because it happens so often?

You pogo'd me once.

You pogo'd Jess twice.

Hey, it's not sexual.

Nick's never been pogo'd directly.

You did get his pizza one time... which, by the way, is a whole nother debate ... how did you not feel that?

Let me get this straight ...

you guys sit around and talk about this?

Your penis actually changed the channel, uh, when we were watching the Bears game once.

You don't think me, Nick and Jess talk about you behind your back?

Because we do.

You have more pogos than anyone.

You are completely misusing the word pogo.

You are the pogo king.

Pogo king.

Pogo king?

So I wanted to talk about your creative imagery assignments.

Wow, guys.

I really felt like I was buried under a giant, gleaming, powdery avalanche of adjectives.

Don't mean to interrupt, I just hear you're the best teacher of adults?

Oh, no.

I wonder if there's room for one more? - No!

How you guys doing? I'm Julius Pepperwood.

Not now, okay?

I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.

I'm here to learn how to write short fiction.

Oh, okay, Julius, just...

take a seat and, um, keep small.

I'm from Chicago.

Thin-crust pizza? No, thank you.

I'm from Chicago.

So, for a fun follow-up...

Sorry, I'm late.

No, problem, Edgar.

We're just going over our descriptive imagery.

I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you. Mr. Pepperwood?

I'm gonna move closer, if you don't mind.

No, you don't have to go... stay over there.

How you doing, pal?

I'm Julius Pepperwood.

Edgar.

What are you doing? If you don't mind me asking, why are you late today, Edgar?

Uh, traffic, it really k*lled me.

It k*lled you?

Mr. Pepperwood.

Would you say that it s*ab you?

Say that again?

How about glasses on or off?

Teach, if I keep them on, am I a bad boy?

Hey.

All right, honey, I'll take them off.

Whoa, that's a whole different lens to see that blue dress.

No.

Okay, let's refocus.

Um, let's talk about the, um, four classifications of conflict.

We talked about it last week.

It's in the workbook, um...

Anybody want to help me?

Four classifications of conflict?

Anybody? Anybody...

So, no one has signed up for office hours and I just want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.

- Adios.

Anything at all.

What are you doing?

Nothing, man, you look good in your Dockers.

What? Nothing happened. I'm Julius Pepperwood.

Let it go.

Whoops.

Why did you do that?

The wind.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Is everything all right?

Yeah, everything's good. Oh, everything's fine, bro.

What's happening right now?

Sorry, Edgar, um, I really loved your story.

Um, I wanted to give you some notes ... is there any time you could come in... to office hours?

Yeah, that be really cool.

I'm really excited.

Um, I'm available anytime, so...

I'll check my calendar.

Yup.

Can't get service around here.

Wednesday I got to go to the bird store.

Uh, what about Wednesday afternoon?

He's my uncle.

Hey, Winston, I'm glad you're home.

I know what my pogo is.

It's that I dance kind of like a sea snake.

Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.

What are you talk... I know this it, man.

Is it that I barge into people's showers?

It's my caterpillar eyebrows ... well, look.

They're gone.

Nick, you've gone way too far! Way too far.

Well, if you're here for Edgar's notebook, you're too late.

Where's the notebook?

Nick!

What's my one rule?

It's to not steal your yarn.

Don't steal my yarn, man.

It's my one thing.

But look at what was inside of his notebook.

Okay, he was doodling in class, Nick.

w*apon, dripping with blood?

That is not a doodle.

What are you, the doodle police?

There's no doodle police, are there?

Really?

I can't believe you still don't believe me.

Jessica...

Exhibit D.

He did this.

I'm going to Edgar's house, I'm looking for more proof.

No, Nick, you're not spying on the one student that I have a connection with.

I have the address right here.

No.

Give me the...

No!

I have the address memorized.

Fine, then I'm coming, too.

To bail you out of jail when you get arrested for trespassing.

Fine, then you'll see that I was right. - Fine!

And you'll also see who gets there first.

Maybe we should take one car.

Just, like, for the environment.

Yeah, that makes sense ... we can drive together.

Fine!

Fine!

It's my mole, isn't it?

Well, consider it gone.

Game, set, pogo.

Chill out, man, it's not your mole.

Just tell me, this is the worst.

This is not the worst, Schmidt ... the worst is actually knowing.

Knowing that your friends sit around every single night talking about your pogo.

What's a pogo?

Those brows don't freak you out?

Nah, I've seen worse.

A pogo is what your friends talk about when you leave the room.

Oh, like your barnacle toenails?

Uh... sh...

You guys talk about my toenails?

Never... talk about your toenails, Sch... Schmidt.

I know my toenails are a little rugged.

Woodsy.

I mean, I have never wondered if you could shimmy up a palm tree.

But it's because I have a keratin surplus, I mean...

They're not that bad, look at these things.

Aah! Schmidt!

Ew!

It looks like an open Swiss Army Kn*fe.

Most of them are hard, but one of them is really, really soft.

I know, I know, I know ... we'll just talk about what my pogo is.

What's my pogo?

Is it the way I say "pan"?

Pan, pan, pan.


Look, Cece, this is more of just a loft thing.

Just thank your lucky stars that you don't have calcified mongrel toes!

Things sound like a dang ol' crab.

There it is.

If anything's gonna go down, we need a safe word.

Nothing's gonna go down unless we make it go down.

If Pepperwood taught me anything ...

There's no Pepperwood.

Never get caught without a safe word.

We're gonna go with "apricot."

That's way too normal. We need to, like, go with something weird, like "dragon slippers."

What?

I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.

Why do you use

"apricot" so much?

What am I supposed to call them ... "sweet tangy b*lls"?

Don't call them "sweet tangy b*lls," Jessica.

Well, that's why we can't use...

Nick... Nick...

Nick, oh!

Shh! Come on...

Nick..

Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.

You look ridiculous.

If we're hiding from people, why does it matter what I call you?

I got my eyes and you get my six.

No, no, what does this mean?

I'm pretty sure this...

This means "right turn bicycle."

No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop...

" It means "right turn."

Nick, seriously ... use your words.

Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.

Okay, these are my words.

Oh!

Apricot, apricot, apricot.

Close your mouth, close your eyes.

Edgar lives with his mother. Of course he does.

So? A lot of normal people live with their mothers.

Like my Uncle Randy.

He can't go near parks.

He was cleared.

You've got to...

Apricot! Apricot!

Get over here now!

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

What's in that duffel bag?

He's the plumber from the story.

How did I not see this before?

What was I saying?

Oh, my God, you were right.

Yes, say that again, say that again. You were right, you were right, you were right about everything.

Don't ever forget you're saying it!

Oh, my God, I can't believe you were right.

I was a right about everything!

What the hell is in that duffel bag?

I don't know.

No, Nick.

Nick, you're gonna get us k*lled.

Let's get down.

Nick... Nick...

Shh.

âª I'm so excited...

Oh, my... Jessica, turn it off.

Turn it off! Oh, my God, it's Edgar.

What do I do?

You turn it... Here.

Turn it off. I don't know how to do this. - Okay.

Oh, my God. Get the hell out of here.

Jess, what are you doing?

That is ridiculous. There was plenty of room.

It seemed like a good idea.

Why would you go under a van?

Let's leave.

Keep still... You will not believe what just happened.

Nick was right.

I was right.

Oh, my God, what happened to your eyebrows?

You look like Audrey Hepburn.

Don't we own an industrial-size paper cutter?

Ugh!

Oh, whatever.

What the hell is that?

So close to the eating area!

Winston told me that you guys make fun of my gremlin toenails.

That you call them "clickety-

clacks" or "centaur boots."

What is wrong with you, Winston?

What is wrong with me? Besides my pogo.

I told him. It just kind of popped out.

You understand what that's like, right, Winston?

Okay, you know what? Don't act like we don't talk about you two behind your backs.

Because we do. You both have pogos, my friends.

Okay, let's take a deep breath and ask ourselves if this conversation is worth ruining our friendships over.

Tell me my pogo.

I need to know my pogo.

You guys need to tell me. I can take it. Lay it on me!

You know, it's kind of a loft thing. Is it my pies?

Are they too tart?

Pies can't be a pogo, okay?

My koala claws, now that's a pogo!

At least you can hide your pogo in a shoe.

They make shoes for your penis ... they're called pants!

Tell me my pogo.

Jessica, no.

Tell me my pogo!

You're a know-it-all!

Huge know-it-all.

The worst.

Oh, I'm the worst know-it-all in the world?

Please. Hate hyperbolic speak. Please.

Now you know your pogo, you truly know it all.

There I go being a smart-ass again.

I mean, that, that could be my pogo.

And then there was one.

Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure that you guys have stuff you laugh at me behind my back.

We don't laugh about your pogo, Nick.

Yeah. We're worried about you.

You're worried about me?

We're worried that you're not gonna make it.

Make it to what?

Just in general.

'Cause you don't take care of yourself.

Sometimes I'll crumple up vitamins and I'll put them in your food.

We all take turns sneaking money into your pants pockets before we put them in the dryer.

Yeah? Well, I hope you're happy.

The pogos are out.

The loft dynamic is ruined.

But what if I talk like a baby?

You're still hot. That's all we're gonna talk about.

A tiny little baby!

Cut into these, please.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh...! A ladder...

That'll do.

Okay, okay.

Oh, this is bad.

Oh, this is... this is very bad.

Oh, no, oh, no ... no, no-

no-no-no-no ... oh, God, oh, God.

âª I'm so excited...

Hello.

Jess, he wants to k*ll you!

What...?

I am in his shed right now What?

And there are drawings on the wall of you, and bloody w*apon and googly eyes.

Googly eyes are actually kind of sexy, but that's beside...

Jess, I will not let you be in a room alone with this guy.

You're the deer in his story.

He wants to k*ll you.

You're the deer, you're the deer, you're the deer.

I'm at school and I'm doing office hours...

Get out now! Okay, I'll just, I'll just keep you on the line, and then I'll say the safe word, okay?

I'll just say it like... Apricots! Apricots!

Good. Yeah, yeah, that's what you say if you see Edgar.

Apricots! Really, apricots!

Oh, no. Okay, okay, stop it.

He's there. Okay.

I thought it was gonna be

"dragon slippers."

Is this a bad time or...?

No, no, no, no. I just have a deaf grocer.

Apricots! Apricots!

And butter.

I'm coming.

Oh! Ho-ho!

Welcome to office hours. Um...

I found my ending.

Yeah?

It's pretty risky. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get away with it.

Oh!

Remember when you told me to base my characters on people from my own life?

Well, I based one on you.

So flattered.

And then I realized that there was only one way for the story to end.

You need to die.

Apricot, apricot.

No! âª Hey...!

âª Uh, uh-uh-uh...!

âª Look at that notebook.

You said, "Great literature is surprising."

What's more surprising than k*lling your main character?

What about this ... go with me ... what if, um, what if my character lives and the book just goes on?

Imagine coming to the end of the book, and then just finding a lot more book.

Surprise.

âª I'm so excited Um, oh.

âª And I just can't hide it...

I heard that song yesterday.

This song is everywhere these days.

Were you at my house?

Okay, thank you. Good-bye.

No.

No! No!

I have to go... right now.

Apricot's leaving! Apricot's leaving!

Oh, good. I'm so happy you're alive.

Okay, stay inside and lock the door.

I am coming. I am going to protect you...

Nick?! Pepperwood! Nick!?

Burglar?! He's not a burglar.

He's Julius Pepperwood from Chicago.

Let's get him in the house.

The D.A.'s gonna have my badge for this.

No! Get off of him!

You k*ll him, you k*ll me, too!

Get away from my Edgar!

My eyes! Oh!

My giant eyes!

You thought I was a m*rder?

You thought I was a m*rder of people?

You said you were gonna k*ll me, so I don't know.

Your character... in my graphic novel.

He's an excellent artist.

Okay, but your drawings, they don't have any eyes.

Hate drawing eyes. It's weird.

He can't draw eyes.

There's a reason for everything.

What about the duffel bag?

Don't ask about the duffel bag!

Bitch.

Whoa, whoa!

Whoa! Hey, man.

Hey, take this as a compliment, pal.

Your stories are so real.

Well, it's because what you taught me.

You listened?

Well, of course I listened. You were a good teacher.

Until you thought I was a m*rder and you broke into my shed.

Aw! You were my favorite student until I thought you were a m*rder.

Ah...

Your son's a really great writer.

He's not my son.

Oh! Are you kidding?!

Really?!

Real nice, you two.

Come here, baby.

Mm! God, you smell like waffles.

I love it. Did you just make some waffles?

Want to eat me up?

Yes, I do.

I'll meet you inside. I'm gonna get the duffel bag.

Yes, do.

Okay.

Hey, Nick.

Hey.

What are you doing up?

Just taking care of myself.

Are you putting butter on bacon?

I don't want it to stick to the pan.

Okay, did you...?

Great.

It's just what bacon needs, more fat.

And salt.

What's this?

Don't read that. I'm not finished...

"Julius Pepperwood:

Zombie Detective"?

All his m*rder victims are already d*ad, so they obviously don't need a detective. I'm working on it.

"The night was inky hot."

Don't do this.

"She strode into his office with a sense of purpose, place, another word here, question mark."

I'm looking for another

"P" word there.

"She had zombie legs that went on for miles.

"They were the kind of legs you could sink your teeth into.

"Pepperwood had two friends ... one, if you count his hat.

The other was his gal Friday, Jessica Night."

It's not you, Jess.

"She was small in stature, but not in spunk.

And a super annoying know-it-all."

Good evening.

Hello.

Oh, bacon.

Where the hell did you come from?

I came from my room.

No, I didn't hear the pitter-

patter of your disgusting feet.

I cut my toenails. Yeah, the soaking really worked.

Look at that. They're gorgeous now.

Went down a full shoe size.

Guys! f*re!

Whoa, whoa!

Oh, my God!

Everybody relax! Call a fireman!

You call the fireman!

I'm the fireman.

You can't put out a grease f*re with water!

You have to smother it!

Why didn't you say that before?!

I don't want to be a know-it-all!

You're so stupid!

Shut up!

Whoo! Oh!

Nice!

Yes!

Amazing, my man! Whoa. Whoa.

Honestly, I didn't know you were gonna put your arm around me.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, you put up your pup tent in front of the f*re.

It's involuntary.

It is a combination of adrenaline and great circulation.

And I'd appreciate it if you don't just hug me randomly!

That's weird and...!

You ever notice... when Winston runs, that he kinda farts while he's running? - Yes!

Sounds like a jalopy.

New pogo.

Oh, we got a great new pogo!

He farts when he runs!

All right, Nick, we believe in you, man.

Tell us, what's in the cup?

Ah, it's a hard one.

It's a mini carrot.

Onion and potato?

Dumbest boy in all the world.

How are you so bad at Feely-Cup?

You are awful at this game.

Sea glass? I'm overthinking it.

If his life depended on this, he would die.

Battery.

When are batteries squishy?

I'm just kidding, I'm kidding ... I know it's not a battery.

I'm kidding. Feel, Nick.

Nick, will you be paying for bonus time?

He can't;

He is all out of quarters.

Uh, Nick?

Your dad's here.

Very funny, Schmidty, but my concentration will not be broken.

Hey-ya, Nickels.

Come on, kid, bring it in.

Come on!

Hello, Mr. Miller. Welcome to our home.

Feely-Cup?

Oh, yeah.

Bring it on.

Watch this.

Tampon...

Wrapped in duct tape...

And dipped... in baking powder.

Is that what it is? Oh, it is.

Boom!

Next level Feely-Cup.

Hello, Mr. Miller.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

This is a pleasant surprise.

What brings you to Los Angeles, Dad?

Let me just, uh, clean up a little bit.

You know, I just thought I'd stop by.

I'll sleep in your bed, you can go on the couch.

Sounds like us.

Hey.

So, what does Mr. Miller do?

Businessman. - A what?

He's a con man.

He is a con man. - He is a damn business ... What are you talking about?

He's a con man.

He's a businessman.

Winston's obsessed with Walt.

That moustache first of all ... what?!

It's like the world's sexiest push broom.

A con man like,

"What's the play?"

The, uh, Ring-A-Doo Johnnycakes?

The, uh, Hollow Leg Swap-Em-Out?

Yes, exactly.

Fake trombones for a fake band.

Harold Hill!

Music Man?

No, he is not a con man, okay?

You know, he sometimes used to sell hats.

There you go, boys ... enjoy.

Thanks, Dad.

So many hats.

Okay, technically, they were misprints.

This says:

"Chica Go Bills."

Let's go, guys ... these hats suck.

"Chica Go Bills" is, uh, actually Spanish for "Young girl, go Bills."

Who's gonna mess with a guy who's wearing a hat that says,

"Young girl, go Bills?"

I mean, the answer is everybody.

They will, they mess with you.

Oh, my... Nick, please do not angry-fix the sink.

I'm not angry-fixing;

I'm fixing!

You want to know why I'm messed up?

Why I don't trust people?

Why I have anger issues?

Oh, yes, I do want to know.

Why I have the blood pressure of a hummingbird?

Do you think this is maybe about your dad?

And so Nickels comes

into my room screaming,

"Daddy, Daddy."

So I go,

"What's wrong?"

He says, "Daddy, I have a tick at the end of my tinkle."

Oh, my God!

This is not a story for everyone.

And sure enough, there is a tick at the end of his little penis.

Not a story for this moment.

That's how he got the nickname "Little Penis."

Oh, stop calling me that.

What are we gonna do with this guy?

I have no idea, Pop-Pop.

Don't call him Pop-Pop.

That's his nickname.

The nickname is longer than Walt.

But that's the nickname that I gave him. - Yeah, but it's really weird that you call my dad Pop-Pop.

I like Pop-Pop.

You don't get it. You don't get it.

Yeah, fine, just don't call him Pop-Pop, so...

I think it's time for another drink.

What do you say, gorgeous?

You want to give an old man a hand?

Sure.

I don't know, Nick.

A lot of charm coming from this end of the booth.

'Cause that's what he does.

He lures you in with his charm and his moustache and his perfect hair.

I feel like you need to talk to him about this.

Right, 'cause I'll just tell him how I feel, and everything will be okay

'cause that's really the way the world works.

Took the words right out of my mouth, Little Penis.

It's not a thing.

I love a good nickname.

Not... not gonna stick.

You know, when Nick is not working here, the service is abysmal.

I mean, how many times did I have to repeat the words, "Lemon Drop sh*t"?

Yeah, I think he was making fun of you.

For what?

Working hard and playing hard?

I guess the joke is on me.

Another Indian guy?

My mom set me up.

Oh, your mom.

That's cool.

Mm-hmm.

Have fun with your, your Devs...

and your... and your An-Anujs...

or your Deepaks.

Whatever Patel you're dating.

I'm-I'm not sweating it.

His name's Pavun, Pavun Shetty.

What?

As in, as in "Shetty Solutions"?

I think so. Why?

They only nailed the crowd-control logistics of b*mb's revamped open-air market.

I thought you weren't sweating it.

I'm not sweating it. Sweating it.

k*lling me with that Drop, dude.

You really seem to care about Little Nicky.

I mean, look at him.

He looks like Hilary Swank mixed with a sad, wet dog.

Do you think he's really angry at me?

I think you need to talk to him.

All I'm looking for is a second chance.

You don't happen to believe in second chances, do you, Blue Eyes?

Actually, I, um...

I'm a bit of a sucker for second chances.

They're my first favorite kind of chance.

Have you ever been to the racetrack?

Back at the tracks with my dad.

When Nick was a kid, he would come to the track with me all the time.

And if I got in trouble, he would get me out of it by doing the Sugar Ray.

Oh, the Sugar Ray.

What's a Sugar Ray?

It's when I pretend to be a diabetic kid so the man who is thr*at to b*at up my father would run off scared.

You see, we did have some good times, didn't we?

Now, come on, let's make a bet.

Here you go.

What's the catch?

What catch? There is no catch.

What possible catch can there be?

All I want you to do is make a bet.

All right, Pop, you want me to lose your money?

I'll be happy to.

Schmidt.

Robby?

Robby, what are, what are you doing here, man?

I'm spying on Cece.

Cece.

You know, I'm still in love with her, so...

this is pretty much your basic broken-hearted spying thing.

It's why I got this hat.

Aw, come on, Robby, you got to get over that.

Wait a second, are you spying on Cece, too?

No. What?

Are you still in love with Cece?

No, that's still...

Yes, I am.

It's k*lling me.

Me, too! Bring it in, man.

What are you two doing here?

Whoa, hey.

Cece?

Just nothing, we're just...

Yeah, you know.

Do you think that she saw me?

What? Of course she saw you.

Do you think she saw me?

Well, yeah, you don't have a hat on.

Nicky only had one dream when he was a kid ...

to own a family horse.

That is so surprising 'cause it just doesn't seem like...

Nick hates living things, so, like, it just doesn't really seem like in line with what I know about him.

All right, look...

I want to buy a horse.

Uh-huh.

For me and Nick to own together.

Oh!

I found this beautiful horse.

Gorgeous!

Right.

Me and you are gonna talk the guy down.

I don't know how to do that.

I'll take care of that.

Okay.

Hey-ya, Dusty.

Aw, ya gotta be kidding me!

How'd he find me?

Who was that?

Eh, don't worry about him.

What do you know about horses?

I know they're big.

Perfect.

This is a very sad case.

I mean...

My niece, she goes to veterinary school.

We're all very proud of her.

Top of my class.

So, what do you, uh, what do you think?

Terrible horse.

She's very sickly.

He. He... He.

He... He.

Oh!

I wish I had brought my stethoscope.

I'm seeing a lot of split ends.

The mane is totally the wrong cut for the shape of his face.

So you're saying that this horse, right now, the way it is, will never race again?

Damn it, Uncle Buck!

This horse will never race again!

Why did you fly me all the way out from Grenada if you weren't gonna listen to me?

Yes, con!

Shh, shh, shh!

Okay, there are people in life who you want to be unpredictable.

Your pothead neighbor, or Vice President Joe Biden.

And then there are people who you don't want to be unpredictable, like your dentist, or, I don't know, your father.

Look, Nick, my dad left when I was three.

Every single day, rain or shine, he just never came back.

I wish he'd been a little bit more unpredictable;

That's all I'm saying.

I hear you.

And yeah, sure, Walt may owe me a couple hundred bucks, but it's not a big deal.

My dad owes you money? How much?

Three, 400... like 1,100 bucks.

Oh, my God, he's with Jess.

He's gonna rip her off.

He's gonna rip her off.

I feel like Cece's making a big mistake with this Indian guy.

She should be with somebody like us.

Totally.

White Guy Power.

Okay, um...

Cool Guy Power.

Now you're talking, Robby.

What are we gonna do?

I don't know.

I mean, one billion Indian men is a daunting foe.

Suddenly I feel sympathy for Pakistan.

But it's like they say,

"How do you eat an elephant, Robby?"

With chopsticks.

What?

Slowly, with chopsticks.

That's ... no ... with chopsticks?!

In a taco.

What?

Elephant tacos.

Elephant tacos? Who eats elephant tacos?

That's not even a saying.

Oh.

One bite at a time, Robby.

One bite at a time.

Yes.

One bite at a time. This is what I'm thinking.

I use my superior powers of manipulation and persuasion to get Cece to take you back.

Once we've neutralized the sub-continental thr*at, I smite you.

What?

What?

You said you're gonna smite me?

Smite ... defeat gloriously for Cece's hand.

No, I know what it means.

But that's someday.

For now, let's scheme, my "broheem."

Okay... I just want to reiterate that I'm not on board with the smiting.

Whatever.

But I like the "broheem" thing a lot.

Let's concentrate on the broheem part.

Concentrate on... okay.

And smite later.

Yeah, okay, yeah.

Cheers, broheem.

You got a great deal.

Good luck, Doc. - Thanks.

Dad!

Hi, boys.

Can I tell him?

I would rather keep it a secret.

Nick, your dream finally came true.

We got you a horse.

It's not my dream to own a horse.

What?

Did you use my friend to buy a horse?

What? No, I swore you wanted...?

Will you excuse me? I gotta take this call.

That is unbelievable, Dad.

He had this whole thing ... he was gonna name the horse "A Father's Love"

'cause you guys always wanted to have a horse together.

Tell me you didn't give him money.

Actually, actually, that's a funny story because I'm actually an investor in...

God!

God!

Walid, drop d*ad!

Damn, Pop-Pop.

Stop calling him Pop-Pop!

Now, listen, I already got people standing by to take the horse off our hands.

Horse semen in Dubai is gold.

No, you can't sell "A Father's Love."

There's more to "A Father's Love" than just semen.

Ew, poetic, but ew.

Dad.


Dusty, I see you and we're doing this right now.

No, no, no, no, no...!

Dusty!

We got your back, Pop-Pop.

Damn, Pop-Pop, man.

Give me that.

Okay, okay, okay!

Father, we got your back, Father.

Five hundred dollars?

You stole $500 from her to buy that horse?

I didn't steal anything from her.

She saw the opportunity for a business investment, and she took advantage of it. I mean...

Dad, she will believe anything.

That's not true, Nick.

My real name is Jamil.

It is?

No, my name is not Jamil!

Nick, that was not fair.

It is Nick, you know that!

You told me in confidence.

How could you think my name was Jamil?

Well, he's weird.

That's a good point.

Just wait for one hour.

You see, I go meet the buyer, I sell them our horse for a huge profit, and because these suckers think our horse is Big Brown's nephew, they'll overpay.

Blue Eyes gets her money back with interest.

Sounds like a great plan. We'll come with you.

And I'll watch you give Jess her money back.

Yeah!

Please, please, don't do this to me.

We're doing it. No, no, you...

You don't understand, you're not a sales guy, okay?

He... he starts to sweat.

Nick only sweats if there's lying involved.

And there's not lying involved, is there?

We're coming with, Dad.

Check this out.

We get seersucker suits...

Yeah.

And two more guys, and then we serenade her with a barbershop quartet.

Well, if we got ten more guys and a plan, we'd form an Ocean's Twelve.

I would be Brad Pitt, you'd be the crafty Asian fellow who does the, uh, who does the flippies.

Oh, I got a great idea.

We can name a star after her, all right?

I know this Web site, and we could put one that's right near the Robbies one through eight.

You have eight stars? - There's, like, a billion stars, they're really cheap.

But eight of them are yours?

That's only going to go up in value.

It's a horrible investment.

I know she's into that Gandhi crapola.

We could self-immolate.

I feel like we're so close.

Wait, Robby.

I got it.

Cool... Guy... Power!

Cool... Guy... Power!

Cool Guy Power! Cool Guy Power!

Cool ... hey.

Is this happening?

Yes.

Why are the two of you even together?

Are you wearing a traditional sari?

Yes.

I begged you to wear a sari.

I had all these sari-related sexual scenarios.

Shh!

"Monsoon Bedding."

"The Best Erotic Mari-bone Hotel."

Stop that.

"Slum-Doggy-Style Millionaire"

But, what, you're wearing the sari for who? Let me see this guy.

No! What... Schmidt! Robby!

You're wearing it for him...

Oh, my God.

Are you... you're having an orgy here? - Mm-mm.

This is a big Indian orgy?

Oh, for God sakes.

They're all wearing their clothes...

I'm telling you, it's an orgy.

Pavun and I can't go on a date until our families...

meet.

We saw you on a date earlier.

That wasn't a date.

I was meeting Pavun's uncle, Manish.

Manish.

That is Pavun.

Oh, that's Pavun. Oh, my God, look at this guy, he's gorgeous.

What are you talking about?

I don't have a chance here. Look at his features.

Look at your features, man.

You're just as gorgeous.

I mean, kind of.

You're kind, you always have gum...

and you've got so much pep.

You know what, You are confident, and you're punctual, and you came up with this awesome plan.

Yeah, we came up with this awesome plan.

Together. - You know what, screw it, I don't even care anymore.

White Guy Power!

That's "white guy."

All right, man.

Let's do it. All right. White Guy Power.

You got to quit it with that, man.

I'm telling you, it's a little r*cist.

Get out of here before I throw you out.

All right.

He is so organized, you know?

I am just... I'm learning a ton.

I'm ready for this. This is good.

This is really exciting.

This is my first middle of the night parking lot horse deal.

This is not gonna work, they're gonna...

It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

Gonna work fine.

Take control of this, please.

I got it, I got it. Yes.

We got it. We got it, Walt.

Hey, look, will you do me a favor, please?

Let me handle this. Just because my dad is in town, I'm not gonna put you in harm's way.

Yup. Okay.

Twist my arm.

I'll be the lookout.

Just keep your head down.

I've got this totally under control.

Hi-ya, fellas.

How you doing?

Eh, I'm good. You?

I'm good.

Just getting over a little cold.

Yeah, I get a little agita myself every once in a while.

Hey, what's going on, everybody? How you guys doing?

Nice to see you. This is my dad; I'm Nick.

Cool half-turtleneck.

How you doing, fellas?

Good.

Just getting over a little cold.

Good.

He makes the white?

This horse is more semen than he is horse.

That's disgusting.

Good. We want semen.

Well, you guys are gonna get semen.

You'll get a bunch of horse semen.

Wait until it's next to a lady horse.

Trust me.

What's the matter? Is sweat?

I don't see sweating. He's not sweating.

Why he sweating so much?

No, no, no, I don't sweat too much.

Why is... are you a cop?

Cop?

No, no, no, no!

Sweat like a cop.

Take off your clothes.

Why would I do that?

Aw, just take off your clothes.

Take it now. - He just wants to see that you're not wearing a wire.

I would like you to defend me here.

Now! Take it off!

Take it off.

No.

Now! Take it off!

Take off your clothes!

Take off your clothes!

Take off your belt!

Take off your belt.

Now, dance.

Turn around. Turn around.

Okay, okay, okay.

All right, all right, all right.

Yeah, look, look, He's got no wire.

He's not... he's not a policeman, he's...

Guys, I'm not wearing a wire.

I'm not a cop.

I just sweat like this when I'm lying.

Lying?

Lying?

No.

Nobody is lying.

No...

You lying to me?

Tire iron! Tire iron!

You're lying!

What is he doing?

The... the gum!

The gum had sugar in it.

These guys are weird.

Weird.

Strange!

You're weird.

Now you have to talk to each other!

You've been conned.

God, I'm good.

That's not a con, Jess!

You're just driving away.

I was ready to get your friend's money back for her, okay?

But you insisted on coming here.

You know what?

You know what's funny about you?

Somehow, you have made this...

seem like my fault.

This isn't my fault!

I didn't invite you here!

Keep talking.

This is good for you guys.

Are you angry at me about something, Little Penis?

I have been mad at you for 30 years, Dad.

30 years?

I am not a successful adult.

I don't eat vegetables and/or take care of myself.

And it's because of you.

Well, okay, maybe I'll take a little bit of that h*t.

Look, it's not "taking a h*t."

It's just saying sorry.

I think you look cold. I'm gonna give you my pants.

I don't want your pants.

Come on, take the pants!

Dad, please don't do that.

You say I do nothing for you.

Let me give you my pants.

I don't want your pants!

Don't do this. Please don't do this.

Take my pants.

This is making it worse!

Dad, the...

This is ridiculous.

Okay.

All right, maybe, uh...

maybe I did make some mistakes along the line, okay?

We all make mistakes, Dad.

Hey, what do you say, tomorrow, we go to a game?

Any game, you pick it out.

I'm in.

You're welcome! Son of a...

This thing doesn't turn so well.

Do you think Cece and Pavun will make it?

I don't know.

Really can't say.

What I can say is that one arranged marriage did take place today.

The marriage of Schmidt and Robby.

Hell, yeah.

I only dread the day that we defeat all the Indians, and must face each other in a duel to the death.

Yeah.

Buzz k*ll.

We're like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Except only one of us dies at the end of the movie.

It's gonna be you.

You're the one that's gonna die.

You want another beer?

Sure do, compadre.

Hey, Walt.

What are you doing?

I thought you were gonna go to a game with Nick today.

Going to get a bagel.

In Chicago.

No! No, I can't...

No. Um, I can't let you go.

This means too much to Nick.

You can't just say you're gonna do things and then not do them.

What was that?

What was what?

That.

What? What?

Damn, you're good.

Listen, Blue Eyes, do me a favor, will ya?

Will you tell him for me that I, uh...

You know, that I...

Just keep an eye on him for me, will ya?

Jess, if you're gonna mess with my sink, put some goggles on.

Your eyes are twice the size of normal eyes;

It's a bigger target.

Walt's gone.

I know how hard it was for you to talk to him, and I just...

some people, I just don't under... they just ... aah!

And I understand why you want to break pipes now.

Let's just drink a bunch and destroy the sink.

I don't need to break the pipes, Jess; I'm fine.

I mean, truth be told, I was happy to see him.

I thought if you talked to him that maybe...

No... Look, Jess...

people don't change.

If someone's broken, they just stay broken.

You're not broken.

I'm a little broken.

No, no, no... no.

Oh, yeah.

You should be so much worse.

Seriously, you could be picking up calls on a banana.

You could be, like,

"Hello?"

I don't know how you made it out.

But... you're good.

Well, look, there's a lot I don't tell you.

I haven't done laundry in five months.

I'm not wearing underwear.

I'm just wearing a big sock right now.

Really.

A big sock.

A very big sock.

I got it.

What do you think about this?

We get a three-person canoe, okay?

Then we got to her house and we rap on the door.

She answers the door, she sees the three-person canoe.

She realizes there's only two of us, and we say, "Ah, what a conundrum. Please join us."

How about this one? We get some night-vision goggles.

All right, that's all I got.

I don't... I don't know what else.

I mean, I would say Trojan horse, but...

In this economy? - I mean, we could always go on a hunger strike.

We enlist in the Navy, we quickly rise through the ranks, and then we can take her to the Naval Officer's Ball. - Feel like we're right there!

Just come, Nick. Why not?

Angie and I are not romantic weekend types.

Sounds like you need some fresh air in a cabin You're dating a stripper.

I'm dating a tall, handsome doctor.

We're both kind of living the dream.

We're not "dating."

What Angie and I have together is pure anarchy in like, a sexy, cool way.

Oh, yeah? - Look at what she did while I was sleeping.

Look at how cool that is.

She doodled on your armpit?

It's not a doodle, it's a tat.

Of poodle hair?

It's not poodle hair. It's like the, uh...

Anyway, no to the cabin.

All right.

And why do you want us to come on your romantic weekend anyhow?

I thought it was just supposed to be you and the doctor.

Okay, I'm a little nervous.

I just need backup.

I want this weekend to be fun and perfect and lovely, and I want him to look at me at the end and go,

"Jess, that was the best weekend I ever had."

I'm glad you're keeping your expectations at a reasonable level.

Come on, it'll be fun.

Roast marshmallows, Yeah.

Make a f*re, Oh, yeah.

And sleep on a bear rug.

You in?

Ooh, no.

Jess, I'm sorry. We're not going this weekend.

All right.

But it's free.

You say free?

Yep.

Yeah, we're 100% in.

I'll go pack now.

Okay.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

==special thanks to err0001==

Oh, wait, wait, wait, keep this in mind, right?

Now, I have a spatula in my hand the entire time, and I'm looking her directly in the eye, and I say,

"You're damn right I want some cake."

Kind of weird.

Hey, what's up? Guys, this is Schmidt.

Hey.

Ready to go?

Yeah, no, let's do it.

It's nice meeting you all.

Hey, uh, Winston, who are those guys?

I don't know, I just met them on the way to the bathroom.

But you were so light and charming.

You were like Pixar Winston.

Yeah, we were just chilling, man, just having a conversation.

We can stay, if you want.

No, Schmidt, I don't want to stay.

I want to eat.

Come on, man.

White Nick, brown Cece.

I'd like to have a frank discussion about race.

Do you think that we're allowing Winston to be his blackest self?

I'm not gonna do this. - Okay, make sure Jess gets these, okay?

Guys, please, I'm being serious.

Okay, Schmidty, I know that you're being serious, but look, Winston has been black his entire life.

I think he knows how to handle it.

We were out the other night for drinks, and well, he encountered some members of his own, and you should have seen the way that he lit up.

I mean, he was like a glow stick.

This is terrible. - Whatever you were gonna do, please do not.

Just don't do it.

I want to create an environment within this loft where Winston feels free, where the gates are open. Let's let Winston turn on his-his black switch and let his black light shine.

This is perfect.

Yes, it is a weekend in the woods.

I'm just glad that we get to spend some time together.

Yeah.

Hey.

Yeah!

Oh, look, it's Jackie O.

Me? All right, thanks.

Yeah, you.

Sorry we're late. I had to stop and buy this bitch-ass a helmet.

Because he wouldn't stop being a bitch-ass.

The helmet we got at a rest stop, the shades are mine.

Yeah.

Free cabin! Whoo!

It's actually my boss's cabin.

That's great! Whoo!

Yeah! USA, USA!

Indian food, dinner? You down?

I thought maybe we'd eat at a place where you wanted to eat at tonight, Winston.

As a strong black man.

What?

What are you talking about?

Hey, man, I get it.

There are just some nights where I'm dying for my zadie's egg salad, pastrami piled a mile high, some matzo, kreplach...

Let's eat some soul food.

Schmidt, I want Indian, southern Indian.

Also, I got you something.

Jah rastafari. - Take this damn thing off my head.

Okay, I'm sorry. You're right.

Forget the hat. Just, I made a mistake.

I just...

Winston, tonight is about you.

I want to be the black friend that you never had.

I have black friends, Schmidt.

I want you to feel supported.

I want you to be able to do the things that you don't feel like I understand.

Okay. So that means you're gonna do whatever I say?

I mean, as long as it's gangster.

Or not. It doesn't have to be gangster.

Well, Schmidt, I want to say thank you for allowing me to be me and I look forward to sharing my people's culture with you tonight.

I've never played sexy Boggle before.

I'm gonna get into that later.

Ow-ooh!

Oops. Okay.

Hey, guys.

Sorry, we were just unpacking.

We could hear very clearly. Very clearly.

Hey, you got a high-pitched scream, man.

Yeah, I do.

So, you guys, we are playing best of 35, um, 'cause I thought you guys were gonna hang out with us.

Oh, Angie, this is my boss's cabin.

Oh! This is it!

Where were these when we were having sex?

That's how I feel. What?

Let's go sh**t things.

Yeah.

Okay.

Not scared.

Just be careful, please.

Good, yep.

Yeah!

All right, well...

That's all right.

Sam, are you having fun?

'Cause I really, really want you to have fun.

Course I am. I'm here with you.

Good.

You know?

Okay, good.

Drink hot cocoa.

It's not much fun without someone f*ring back.

You're amazing!

Wow!

That is not safe.

That is really reckless.

You want to sh**t g*n, don't you?

Go on.

Guys, guys! Save a b*llet!

Could be a little bit closer.

Got to be kidding me.

How do you keep missing?

Come on!

Hey, guys.

Hey.

Hey.

No g*n safety for us, right?

Want to sh**t?

No, no, no, do not give her a g*n. She cannot handle having a g*n, trust me.

All right, you know what, yeah, give me the boom stick.

The what? It's not called a boom stick. It's a r*fle. So...

What? Give me the r*fle.

Oh, right.

Whoa, yeah, you know what?

I feel powerful.

Whoa! Come on now!

Come on! Hey!

Okay, all right.

Nobody better...

Hey! Jess!

Hey!

Jess, thanks.

Are you nuts?

Here, all right, see that can?

Yep.

All right.

But I need like, a back story.

Like, why am I mad at the can?

That can is your ex-boyfriend, and, uh, he did not respect your space and, um, thought that your arts and crafts section of your house was ridiculous.

What?

And, right, done? Enough?

Yeah. No. Yeah.

Yeah. - Let me just square your hips right there.

All right, center your... there you go.

Now let me just move your hair.

It's so pretty, really curly.

Thanks.

Fantasy and nightmare colliding.

Take a deep breath.

Congrats.

We have no power.

Uh...

I'm just gonna...

Whoa! Jess, that's it. Let go of the r*fle.

I mean it; You're done. You're done.

Jess, I'm having a great time.

Oh, yeah, I'm so mad at you right now.

Guys, I think that this just turned into an adventure.

Look what I found in the owner's closet.

Yes!

Thank you so much.

You rule.

This is good stuff.

See, making the best of the night. Sweaters.

A little mothy.

Look what else I found in the owner's closet.- What?

CrÃ¨me de menthe, guys.

Oh, get in here, girl.

Oh, body warmth.

Take a pull.

Ooh, yeah.

pass her over.

Ooh, that's...

Yeah.

That is not crÃ¨me de menthe.

That is, uh, the green fairy right there.

It's absinthe.

Yeah, it's absinthe.

Absinthe?

Absinthe...

Nice.

Has k*lled so many of our most famous painters.

Last time I tried absinthe, I tried to put my car in my pocket.

Come on.

Let's get crazy.

Come on, babe.

Yeah.

Okay, yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Perfect weekend!

No, no!

No!

Whoa, too much.

Oh, guys.

I don't feel anything.

Well, those were just the best

ribs that I've ever had.

Ooh, you ain't lying, child.

Thanks for dinner, Schmidt.

You know, I really appreciate it, man.

I do feel supported.

So what's next?

There is this one thing that I miss.

I probably shouldn't say, man.

I can't.

No, come on.

It's us, man.

Schmidt, I could really go for some cr*ck.

What?

cr*ck cocaine?

I remember when I was a kid, me, my mom, and her mom, and well, her mom, and then her mom, and then of course her mom, and then my little cousin, Peanut, they'd all rush back to that flaming trash can where we'd sit around and harmonize and just... âª shoo-op. âª

One of those nights I remember, well, we ran out of cr*ck.

I'd grab my scarf, and I would run on down to the liquor store where the thugs hang out, and I would try to get a good deal on some cr*ck.

Whoo! They never would give me a good price, man, but, uh, I tell you what, there's nothing like the... the feel of a f*re, a fresh-baked cookie, and that sweet, sweet taste of cr*ck in your lungs.

Okay.

Okay, Winston, yeah.

Sure, I mean, if...

If that is something that you want to do...

See, I knew you were gonna judge me.

I knew it.

No, Winston.

I knew you were gonna judge me and just...

Winston, listen to me.

Look...

if cr*ck cocaine is what you want then cr*ck cocaine is what we are going to get.

How do we do this?

Here's what we do, Schmidt. We go to the projects, okay?

We knock on some doors.

I'll wait in the car and take lookout while you do all the legwork.

Because as you say, you are in much better shape than I am.

You do have the body of a Smurf.

We could... We could just get frozen yogurt.

It's not a big deal.

Schmidt isn't about no frozen yogurt.

I want to go score some cr*ck cocaine.

Really?

We're gonna do this.

Look at them. This is a cabin, guys.

Getting wasted on a couple of sh*ts of absinthe.

Word games, word games, word games, word games, word games.

Doctor! I was saying...

I don't think I feel it.

I can't believe I'm the sober one.

That's actually never happened in my life.

Who wants to play Charades?

Me.

One syllable, one syllable.

Movie.

Gattaca.

Oh, I want to be them.

I have to run upstairs for a sec.

I have it on good authority my bed has disappeared.

I need to go check it out.

I got to head up there and take care of that.

Oh, you-you're gonna go upstairs?

Yeah, yeah.

Now?

Yeah.

Oh, ho-ho-ho, yeah.

Okay.

Have fun.

I will, I guess.

Up.

Doesn't sound good.

Oh, Jess.

That sounded terrible.

The absinthe has found a new host.

The toilet.

Oh...

I like Angie.

She's cool. It's kind of like riding a poorly maintained carnival ride.

I'm glad you get it.

I think she really likes you.

All right.

Jeth... I'm not... I'm-I'm with Jeth.

Hey, Nick, look, we switched.

And look... middle of the night...

What is the big deal?

I... why else did we all go to a cabin together?

To hike?


Guys, I'm still really feeling it.

I just can't believe you'd do that to Nick.

She didn't do anything to me.

We have an open relationship.

She can do whatever she wants. I don't care.

Enough. I'm tired of you acting like this cool guy with an "open relationship."

That is not you.

Yes, it is, Jess.

Why won't you just let me be me? This is me!

I'm sorry. I just don't believe you.

You're not this guy.

No, no, no, I'm not feeling good...

At least we don't pretend to be this perfect couple.

I do not pretend to be a perfect couple.

The only reason that we're here is 'cause you asked us to come,

'cause you didn't want to be alone with Dr. Sam.

'Cause then you'd have to be real with him.

Jess? Is that true?

Yes, but no... it's out of context.

It's out of context, Nick.

You think you know everything about me.

I'm a rock and roll guy.

You are the guy who asks me to light matches for you

'cause you're afraid your fingers are gonna get too hot.

I did that one time.

Multiple times.

I was on the back of a motorcycle earlier, and I wasn't even that scared.

You don't think I'm crazy?

No.

Would a sane man do this?

Oh!

Oh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

You're doing it. You're doing a lot of it.

You need to just pace it a little bit...

Oh, whoa, that...

you're really doing it.

Whoa!

Well?

I suppose we could just get out and ask any of these street youths.

I'll let you get out the car first.

Go ahead, do your thing, man.

I don't want to ask the wrong person and end up with some sub-par cr*ck.

I want the fresh cr*ck, you know?

Not some cr*ck that's been laying around all day.

Ooh... I'm really starting to schvitz.

We don't have to do this. Man, we could just turn this car around, forget this ever happened, and get you some frozen yogurt.

I will not let you deny who you are any longer.

Not on my watch.

Schmidt...

Hey, psst!

Schmidt, no.

Yes. Skee-you!

Skee-you!

Schmidt!

You, dude.

Don't call that man to this car.

Hi, how are you this evening?

What do you guys need?

It's cool, just get in the car, man.

What cool?

Yeah, we're cool.

Schmidt, you did not invite this guy in this car.

He could be crazy, could have a g*n.

That's a r*cist thing to say, Winston, that he...

Stop it, Schmidt...

Just assuming that this man has a p*stol.

Hi, sir.

How are you this evening?

Um, the two of us are very interested in purchasing some cr*ck cocaine.

You guys cops?

What?

Okay, let me out.

Schmidt, Schmidt... I was just messing with you, man.

Okay? I was just trying to see how far your stupid white guilt would take you.

Have you ever done cr*ck?

Hell, no, I've never done cr*ck, man.

Why do you think I've done cr*ck? Because I'm black?

I thought you'd done cr*ck

'cause you told me the whole story about you doing cr*ck.

I though you guys just needed directions, okay?

Let me out!

Okay, sir, just calm down, all right?

Oh, please, man.

Be cool.- Fine, okay, look, you want it? You want it? Look!

Whoa! No!

Oh my God, no!

Look, my wallet.

No! No!

Take my wallet! Here's my wallet, okay?

sh**t the white dude! Just let me out...

sh**t him! No, don't sh**t me!

sh**t him, man! But that's...

That's your wallet.

That's your wallet.

Are you not robbing us?

You're not robbing me?

I don't want to rob you, man.

I thought you were gonna...

I totally misread the situation.

I thought you was robbing me.

Oh, no, man.

Oh, hey, man, I'm Schmidt.

Robert, man.

Robert. Nice to meet you.

Pleasure, man.

Robert, man, hey, man, nice to meet you, man.

What a nice smile he has. All right, guys.

I'm just...

Okay. Here, I'll... they're the child locks.

I don't even have kids, but...

You guys have a great night, okay?

You, too, man. Be safe.

Take care, Robert.

Take it easy, man. - You guys have a good night, man, all right.

That was insane.

I was terrified. That...

Oh, my goodness.

I judged...

God, Robert!

Robert...

I just... the wallet?

Oh, your wallet...

Oh, your wallet.

Just give him the wallet.

I'm really sorry.

Yeah, it's kind of...

No, yeah, I get it.

I'd want my wallet back, too.

Thank you.

All right. Thanks, Robert.

I wouldn't thank him.

Whoa, man.

What a hilarious misunderstanding.

Schmidt, drive the damn car.

No, you're right.

You know, I feel so much better after throwing up into the f*re.

Uh, Sam, can you pass the bread?

Oh, sure thing.

No, I'll pass the bread, Angie.

Just keep your hands to yourself and let the bread come to you.

Why do you keep taking my bread?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I thought you and the bread had an open relationship.

I said I was sorry. I thought this was an agreement.

I thought we were all cool with this. I don't...

Absinthe!

Fun dinner. Fun dinner.

I always have fun at the cabin.

You guys want to pick my brain?

You guys want to know what I'm thinking about?

I like dogs more than cats.

I like chipmunks more than squirrels.

I believe in UFOs.

I once had a bass teacher, when I was younger, who did the standing bass.

And he had a very weird smell, and I still think about it.

His name was Mr. Hilton.

I don't like the fact that you tried to kiss Sam.

Because I have feelings for you, Angie.

I'm... I had no idea, I'm sorry.

I know. We said it was open, but...

I'm proud of you for saying that.

Dr. Sam?

If you were a hat, you'd be a top hat.

But like a really big Monopoly one.

And I say that of the deepest compliments.

Appreciate it.

Winston, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.

What, help me realize that I'm black?

Schmidt, believe it or not, man, I've known that for a while now.

I just feel bad you're forced to live here with Jess and Nick.

Oh, wow.

I mean, they're h*nky as hell.

And look at our people. Look what we've given to this country.

Jazz...

The management of jazz musicians.

But, look, Schmidt, being black means whatever I want it to mean.

You know, the fact of the matter is I live in a loft with three people who happen to be white.

But believe you me, there is so much more that I find annoying about you that I haven't even gotten to race.

Now, I'm gonna get some frozen yogurt.

Would you like anything?

Yeah.

I'll have a vanilla chocolate swirl.

No.

What, no...

No. I'll have strawberry with jimmies.

Did you get that?

Hey.

How you doing?

Much better.

That alcohol got on top of me.

Oh... I'm a little embarrassed by that.

I'm sorry about Sam.

I... I thought it was cool.

Right. - And I try to ruin things as soon as they get good.

I'm working on it.

Believe it or not, I'm working on stuff, too.

You know, I just wish I was working on less stuff.

You know, I've been arrested three times.

Four times.

Four to five times.

I have tattoos of bands that I don't even like anymore.

By the way, you've been really cool about the "Jamiroquai"

tattoo on my butt.

I'm not asking you to change.

Just how about meet me in the middle a little bit?

What do you want me to do? Go to brunch?

Are we supposed to, like, read articles and then talk about them together?

Okay, I'm never going to be that kind of girl.

I just want to do something normal.

How about not drawing pubes on my armpit while I'm sleeping?

You think you could do something like that?

Yeah. Yeah.

'Cause I would really like to keep this going.

Want to move your twin bed over here?

Sexy, sexy, sexy.

Bird! Bird! Bird!

Bird!

Oh.

Help! Help!

Oh, my God.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

No big, I got it! I'm on it.

Just a... it was a painting.

That's not really how I wanted the weekend to go.

I thought the worst thing that could happen was someone wouldn't like the cheese I brought.

I wanted it to be perfect.

Jess, when Nick said that you invited them because you were nervous...

No, don't worry about that.

Jess, we're not perfect.

Like the first time we slept together, like, I didn't even know your real name.

Kind of a pretty sassy detail.

Can we just concentrate on the fact that, like, I was tripping pretty hard on absinthe and I said, "No"?

To a stripper?

I mean, a stripper was like rubbing my leg...

That's weirdly...

the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

Got it.

I left a Post-it note on the transformer that said "Broken."

Is there any way that we could make it look like it was raccoon bites?

A few announcements.

Uh...

Angie left. Me.

What?

She took the motorcycle, and, uh, a few of my belongings, but I'm still wearing my underwear, so she comes up short-handed in that treasure hunt.

Seriously?

Oh, I'm so sorry, Nick.

I'm sorry, man.

It's fine; I'm a grown man.

I will need a ride home.

Yeah.

Obviously.

I would love to pitch in with gas, but I don't have any money, so I could pay in "Nick Bucks,"

fully redeemable for smiles and any one item from my bureau.

We'll hold you to that.

Thank you, Doctor.

Don't, I-I'm good.

I know you don't want to be hugged.

I don't want to be hugged.

And I respect that. So...

Okay. 'Cause I'm fine.

Jess, no, I'm good, I'm good.

I promise you, I'm good. Just...

Actually, this is very weird for me.

I'm not hugging you.

I know.

I'm sorry.

I promise you I'm okay.

Stop making this a thing, because I'm not sad.

This is for the best.

Yeah.

I'm fine.

She didn't deserve you.

Whatever that means.

Thank you.

Okay, almost there.

Hey, let's go!

All right.

Hey, the potato salad's accidentally in the garbage.

Look at that.

You guys mind if I eat this in the back seat?

You can eat salad in my back seat anytime.

Didn't mean that to be sexual.

All right, guys.

It's a little bit gamey.

Okay.

I'll get the garbage, here.

Hold on, hold on.

The absinthe.

You almost screwed that up by accident.

Wow.

We're ready. You all right?

Yep, I'll be right with you guys.

That was a mistake! Whoo!

I am gonna poop weird tonight!

Yeah... Oooh, that was a mistake.

02x11 - Santa




Quote





Post

by bunniefuu Â» 12/13/12 22:10

You know, maybe I found out too early.

I was five years old when "Santa" gave me my own f*re truck and a teddy bear that smelled like my dad's cigarettes.

That's not Santa.

I just believe things and go on believing them.

If someone tells me a fat man's bringing me dolls every year, I just don't question it.

You would've been my nightmare.

We were on very strict instructions from Rabbi Schmulie not to say a word until the last Christian kid found out about Santa Claus.

Ruining Christmas, very bad for our brand.

Well, whether or not Santa's real, it's just nice to have something to believe in.

Did you just say

"Whether or not Santa's real"?

You don't believe in Santa Claus, do you? - No.

Do I wish Santa was real?

I mean, yeah.

Santa's not real, Winston.

Shut up, stupid! You're a dummy!

So... and... I don't even c...

Like, you're the... Okay, aw, here we go.

You know what, look who's talking. You're the same guy who only eats mayonnaise on game days.

That's how you makee the Chicago Bears win.

Hey, Winnie, were you a good boy this year?

Oh, really?

Stop, guys, stop!

Don't throw the cranberries!

Get him!

Stop!

I don't mess around!

No!

Truce! Truce! Truce!

Go for the eyes!

Truce! Truce!

One got stuck in my ear.

We got a cranberry in his ear.

How is that even possible?

Why don't you ask Santa Claus to take the cranberry out of your ear?

Huh?!

I said it got stuck in my ear!

Truce! Truce! Truce! Truce!

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

These pieces don't make a full berry.

There's definitely something still stuck in there.

Hey, would anybody mind giving me a ride to the airport tomorrow?

Full disclosure:

It's out of San Diego at 3:00 a.m.

So tonight's our last chance for a holiday hang-together?

A group hang on the Saturday before Christmas?

No, sorry, I can't tonight, Jess. Office party.

There are literally millions of parties. It's a puzzle as...

That's what you guys are talking about, right?

I mean, it's not like I can hear anything, because I got a cranberry stuck in my ear!

You're yelling.

Huh?

Slade and Sienna are having a house thing.

Oshiro-San is serving whale meat after midnight.

Huh? What y'all talking about?

Shut up.

Sadie is having a cookie-decorating party.

The gorilla twins are having a thump-thump.

Let's try to h*t all the parties we can.

Otherwise, I'm just gonna stay home and try not to call Sam.

What'd you say?

I'm gonna die alone.

And merry Christmas.

We have to hang out together.

I hate that idea.

I'll be designated driver.

I'm in.

Okay, yeah, let's do it.

The only we make this work is if we do the Irish good-bye.

We leave the parties without saying good-bye.

And I'm asking you guys as my friends to not be so damn awkward around my stripper girlfriend, just 'cause she's a stripper.

You are the most awkward.

You should probably stop calling her your "stripper girlfriend."

She's unpredictable and exciting, and I love that!

Ol' Nick Miller lives on the edge now. Vroom! Vroom!

And plus, we haven't had sex yet, and we might tonight.

I understood that!

Oh, yeah!

What'd you say, though?

âª On the first day of Christmas âª
âª My true love gave to me a partridge... âª

Merry Christmas!

Am I talking too loud?

Schmidt?

What?

A word?

What?

You haven't said one word to Cece since she got in the car.

I cannot believe that you invited her.

She's my best friend.

Hey, can I talk to you a little later?

Oh, were you hoping that I still had some soul left for you to crush?

I'm glad we're gonna be mature about this.

Whoa, what happened there?

Nothing. He told her that he loved her...

Okay, I just want to spend the night making it with some fatty in an elf costume.

Is that too much to ask for?

Instead I'm stuck here at this Lesbian cookie party.

It's all wreaths, no trees.

All right, Jess, you're on the clock;

You have five minutes in this party black hole.

Your friends are cool.

Yeah, no, no, I like them.

Yeah, they...

I live with them.

But being serious, it's been really fun.

I'm glad we're hanging out and spending time together and all that good stuff.

You know, to be completely honest, when I first met you, I didn't think that you could handle this.

Handle what? The fact that you're a stripper?

Me being... Yeah.

Are you kidding?

Me?

Yeah.

Is it good? You're sweating a little bit.

You know what, lady, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.

I've had tetanus thrice in my life.

Ew. - And look at what a badass cookie I made.

That's the kind of cookie Nick Miller makes.

Fine, look at my cookie.

What?

Yeah, but there are people here.

Are you not into having sex around people?

Who are you talking to?

Yeah? - I'm so open with sex, it's ridiculous.

You could at least take your coat off.

Oh, but I can't.

Pastel walls give me the chills.

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, my God!

What?

What...

It's Sam! It's Sam! Put your coats on.

We're leaving.

Sam Sam? Where?

Yes, he's right over there.

He's talking to a woman whose sexuality I won't jump to conclusions about.

What a situation, huh, Jess?

Forced to spend time with someone who ruthlessly rejected you after you told him how much you cared about him.

Maybe...

Damn, he looks good.

Just wants everyone to get along.

Okay, if he wanted everybody to get along...

I'm seriously freaking out right now.

...then he wouldn't have acted like such a callous lady jerk.

Lady jerk?

Lady jerk.

I'm seriously freaking out right now.

Duck! He's gonna see you.

Ow. We have to get out of here, you guys. Where is everybody?

Yeah, man, see, when a cranberry gets lodged in the ear, it hurts. Look.

Psst, Winston.

Hey!

Do you guys know Sam's here?

Jess? - We're Irish good-bye-ing. Go! Go!

Go?

Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go!

All right, Schmidt, what's the address?

Get ready, last year

this party had acrobats

and caged snow leopards.

What?!

We're all here together. No drama.

Not bad, Schmidt.

Thank you.

Are they just gonna play computer music all night?

What are you talking about? That's a really respected deejay, who was also an actor on Boy Meets World.

Hey, Jess. Whoa, Sam.

What?!

No!

Why is this happening? No.

Please, I need to talk... Oh, God.

No. Oh, my...

Oh, I feel like a bird.

Aw, that's just sad.

How are you here?

Winston told me where the party was in exchange for an ear exam.

Winston told you what?!

What?

Jess, listen to me.

I want you back, Jess.

Oh.

Oh!

Are none of these doors?

Oh!

What, he just wants a relationship now, out of the blue?

You never just dreamed about him crawling back to you?

Anybody who's ever been dumped has dreamed about that special someone crawling their way back to them.

I mean, come on, right? It's the dump fantasy.

Let's workshop that term.

Of course I have.

We meet in a hospital, during wartime.

You can forgive a lot during wartime.

That is a fantasy, Jess.

Okay, people don't change.

They just think that they do.

He's a player. Think about it.

Why would a good-looking person ever become a doctor?

Jess?

Oh, my God! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Go, go, go.

Door...

Jess?

Jess, uh, I don't know if you're in here.

I just wanted to tell you that...

I messed up.

You know, I-I went to that party to see you.

I knew you were gonna be there, 'cause I saw the comments on the Evite.

"Amazeballs, can't wait."

If you are here, I'm sorry if this sounds a little rehearsed.

This is the third room I've done this in.

Hey, what's he saying?

I want to hear...

Shut up, Winston.

Jess?

Jess?

Yep.

No.

You just think you can come back and I'm just gonna be waiting for you?

No, of course not. I mean...

I had to at least try.

You're too late.

I'm in love.

What?

With Winston.

What?

We've lain together.

No, yeah, I don't know how it happened.

It just got stuck up there so far, so quickly.

The relationship.

You know, sometimes when we're hanging out, it can get a little rough.

Oh, boy, does it.

Yeah.

All right. Well, I didn't know that, so...

What's going on? I feel like I'm missing something.

Snow time.

Hey, what are you doing? No, no, no.

Hey, everything is so expensive here, Angie.

Don't. Get off that thing.

Why don't you get on?

You know what?

Get in the sleigh, girl.

What happens in the sleigh?

What happens in the sleigh is I'll be your reindeer...

Uh-huh.

And take your toys up in the sky.

Sexy.

Ooh! Ho ho ho!

Here comes the chubby Santa boy!

Get in here.

This is real.

We are... This is...

You are quick to the belt.

Let's do this.

You have been Taken.

What's that?

A nearly perfect Liam Neeson.

Whoa!

Oh, no!

No! This isn't...

This is my nightmare!

Merry Christmas!

Oh.

Hey. I know... I know you're trying to avoid me, but just take this gift I got you and I will walk away.

I don't celebrate Christmas, okay? Or as I like to call it, White Anglo-Saxon Winter Privilege Night.

I really want us to be friends.

Whenever you're ready.

Because I really do care about you.

Thank you so much for this.

'Cause this makes it so much better.

Here. This is for you.

What if you came home with me tonight?

You look like a hot elf.

Hold still.

Uh-huh.

Got it.

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, man.

Now that I think about it, I mean, I'm not really surprised by you and... you know.

I mean, three guy roommates.

If I really am being honest with you, you were the only one that I was really thr*at by.

I mean, you got Metrosexual Jones and Sweatshirt Guy over there.

What are we talking about here?

Yeah, I would trade places with you in a heartbeat.

You know, except for the mustache.

Can I ask you something? How did you get her?

Oh...

Hmm.

Jess.

Yes. Yes, my love.

Honey, we both know we have been unhappy for far too long.

I am not just a vehicle you get to ride to Pleasure Town.

Be gone, h*nky!

This is for your own good.

Say good-bye to paradise, honey!

We were never going out.

Yeah, I got that.

I mean, Sam, what am I supposed to think?

So what? I'm just supposed to believe you when all of a sudden you come back to me, and you tell me you want to make it work?

I-I want to believe you, but I just feel so...

No!

No! Why do you think you can just kiss me?

I thought that was the right...

That's all this ever was to you.

That's not true, Jess.

No.

No. I'm always so gullible, and I'm not doing it.

I'm not doing it anymore.

I'm done.

Oh, I mean, I get it.

I'm... I'm too late. I messed up.

Yeah, you did. You messed up.

Well, I'll leave you alone. Merry Christmas.

No!

I'm leaving you alone.


I know... I know you do this kind of thing all the time, but believe it or not, I don't.

What? What does that mean?

Look, I know for you, this kind of stuff is normal.

Oh.

Doing it in sleds.

And...

Oh, this is because I'm a stripper.

Yeah.

Are you laughing at me?

No.

I'm laughing into me.

Maybe you just can't handle this.

No. It's great.

You're a stripper for now. I'm a bartender for now.

For now?

We're not gonna be that for...

Okay, well, for now, I'm just gonna walk away.

For now, you can kiss my ass.

Nick Miller ... turning lemonade into lemons since 1981.

Up on the housetop.

Click, click, click.

You know, I just want to say what's up to all my girls in the county looking so lovely, like you always sometimes do.

âª Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go? âª
âª Ho, ho, ho...

Hey.

Hey.

What are you doing in this place?

Um...

And we're back, and I'm Dr. Gavin Daytona.

You are live on the radio. We got a caller Wendy.

You are on the phone with the doctor. What have you got?

Hey. Hey, Doctor.

This is Dr. Gavin. You're live to five million people.

I actually, I-I had a guy...

Oh, yeah, you did.

I really liked him.

Wah, wah!

I'm right not to believe him, right?

I don't know, actually.

I think you're the kind of girl a guy would come back for.

Buh, buh, buh.

It was a bracelet.

I don't even know what you're talking about.

Tungsten carbide, because you said that was the most baller metal.

That's what Statham wore in all the Transporter movies.

I just wanted to try to find a way to say thank you for telling me that you loved me.

Even if I was the wrong person.

You're welcome, Cece.

But love is stupid, okay?

It is a lie.

So, bah humbug to you, Cecilia.

Bah humbug.

Bah...

humbug.

âª Up on the housetop, click, click, click... âª

Where is your girlfriend?

I blew it.

She's so out there and adventurous, and not afraid, and...

She's probably bored of me already.

I mean, she doesn't want to be here.

Does Angie ever do anything she doesn't want to do?

No.

What's wrong with a girl that's fearless? I think that could be good for you, especially since you're such a chicken.

Don't.

Go get her.

Is this on?

It's on.

Right on. Cool.

Um... Angie?

I just want to say publicly that I'm an idiot.

I couldn't just put myself out there all the time.

It's too scary.

I'm not as brave as you, but here goes.

I'm very poor.

Having a checking account would be an honor.

I'm a writer.

I've written a zombie book. It's terrible.

I'm a slow runner.

I'm obsessed with karate.

Yeah, yeah.

You are the scariest thing in the world.

And you're so goofy to be going out with me.

And I don't want to...

Thank you for...

Winston?

Why don't you do me a favor, homeboy?

Sorry I called you homeboy.

But turn that damn music up.

'Cause I'm about to get sexy up in here.

âª Deck the halls with boughs of holly âª
âª Fa la-la la-la, la, la, la, la âª

-âª 'Tis the season to be jolly...âª

Sexy?

No. - Weird choice, but I'm going for it.

âª Don we now our gay apparel... âª

Would you give me a second chance?

âª Fa la-la la-la, la, la, la, la âª

Yeah.

Good. See, I know what sexy is.

What's happening?

And I'm gonna show you what kind of...

Huh? Oh.

Oh, no, no. Oh, okay.

Is this, is this a lap dance?

This...

This isn't happening.

âª Follow me in merry measure... âª

Oh, yeah, that-that's the stuff.

That-That's kind of the stuff.

Sexy.

âª Fast away the old year passes âª
âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... âª

Let me show you how to do it.

âª Ye lads and lasses

âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

âª Sing we joyous all together

âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

âª Heedless of the wind and weather âª
âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... âª

Okay, Angie, Angie, you're doing it all wrong.

Okay, honey?

Let me just...

Eye contact.

âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... âª

What are you doing? You are as dumb as it gets.

âª Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

âª Don we now our gay a...

- What the hell?

- What are you doing?

I just... I-I'm sorry, I think I made a mistake about Sam.

- I think I need to turn around.

- No, you didn't, Jess.

You did the right thing.

You're right, you're right.

Aah, no!

Oh, come on.

No, no, no.

No, no, no, no.

We are so busted.

Oh, Jess, you reek of booze.

Winston threw a drink on me.

Turn on the waterworks.

Just take the jacket off.

We are so busted.

There's two of you? Come on, I thought we were in the middle of a budget crisis.

Officer, I understand how this looks and smells, but I assure you, I would not ever get behind the wheel of a vehicle if I had had even a drop to drink.

This has just been the most crazy night.

And I'm not going to cry because I believe in traffic violations and paying your debt to society, but you have to believe...

I believe you.

You do?

Why?

Jess, be cool.

Sometimes people tell the truth.

You drive safely, and happy holidays.

Was that...?

Santa.

Black Santa.

We saw Santa.

It was Black Santa.

Santa Claus isn't even real.

We got a black president, we got a black Santa Claus.

It was not Black Santa Claus!

What a ... that's ludicrous.

I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

Now, what is he doing?

He should be at home getting ready.

I believe.

I believe Sam and I want to go see him.

To the Black North Pole!

We saw Black Santa.

Black Santa Claus?!

I am so sick of hanging out with Christians.

This is my last Christian Christmas.

Hi, um, I'm here to see, um...

Do you have family members in the hospital?

Uh, no, uh...

Then, you're not here to see anyone.

Visiting hours are over.

It's Christmas!

Okay, new plan.

We're carolers.

Gum?

Boobs?

Thank you.

FYI, I'm totally fine with what just happened.

Schmidt, let's go, let's go.

Look.

Jess, I still think this is a mistake.

I mean, what if he hurts you again?

Sometimes people tell the truth, Schmidt.

Oh, thank you, Professor ClichÃ©, just in time for the holidays.

Hold it. Oh, okay, well, we should...

Um, madrigals.

âª O come, all ye faithful

âª Joyful and triumphant

âª Matzo ball, Star of David, Hanukkah âª
âª Gotta do what you wanna do when you do it âª âª Menorah

âª Come

âª I don't know the words

âª I don't know the words... âª
âª I don't...

âª Know

âª The

âª Wo-o-o-o-o-o-r...

âª ...rds-ah!

Good stuff.

Yeah, thanks so much. Thank you very much.

Okay, okay, everyone, back in your rooms.

It's okay, I know these people.

It's okay.

All right.

Thank you.

You came back.

Yeah, um...

Jess, I know that you don't believe me, but when we met, I...

this girl had screwed me up.

I believe you.

âª My friends wanna know how it came to be that, ooh âª

All right, you're in a hospital, so...

A lot of hands.

All right, Doctor, ease up, ease up.

âª 'Cause I caught Santa under my tree... âª

Cab it to the next party?

Yes.

Cece, do you want to come?

I mean, I think there's a cab stand, uh...

Uh, maybe it's down that way.

Could be over there, I don't know.

I didn't really give it away, you know.

I'd never do that.

Happy Hanukkah.

Happy Moon Festival, Cece.

Nope, not a thing.

Happy Carnaval.

You should stop while you're ahead.

Uh, where are Nick and Angie?

Ugh, in a children's hospital.

Sexual animals, sexual animals.

Shameless, just shameless.

I can't believe they're playing these old matches.

Man, these were legendary.

Camel clutch!

That's not a camel clutch.

That is a camel clutch.

Gentlemen, hi.

I'd just like a moment of your time.

Jess, you can't turn that off.

If I may.

I have a word that's gonna change your life.

The answer is already "no."

Bathtub.

Bathtub's two words.

It's one word.

Bathtub is two words.

How come I'm James Brown?

When you don't smile for my pictures, you get replaced.

You come home after a long, hard day at work.

Tired.

You want to relax, but how?

How about soaking in a glorious bubbly pool for one?

Sipping the nectar of the gods.

I don't get it ... is this bath water?

Might as well be;

It's rosÃ©.

Burn notice, France.

Now that I'm working again, Don't do this.

I'd really love to come home and soak in a beautiful bathtub.

Bathtubs are Medieval filth cauldrons ... pass.

Yeah, it's a waste of money, Jess.

I'm not interested in simmering in testicle tea for 20 minutes.

Loft vote.

No.

No.

Feel like I'm at a garden party, haven't even left home.

Winston, what are you talking about ... loft vote, no.

What, yeah, no, duh, of course.

Okay, you know what ... loft vote...

Nay.

Loft vote.

Nay.

Loft vote, I'm turning wrestling back on.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Camel clutch! Camel clutch!

No.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª who's that girl? âª
âª it's Jess. âª

Hey, Schmidt.

Ooh, hey. - Want to pitch on the new Double V campaign?

I'm all about the Double V ... what is that?

It's a new vodka, yeah.

Filled with vitamins ... Double V?

What do you think?

You know, I've never been considered to run an account before.

Wait a min... Wait, is this just is this because we used to... bingity-bangity?

No, of course not.

Take a look at the specs and come into my office tomorrow in your best suit, and, uh, blow me away with your take.

My best suit ... I can put on my best suit.

Okay.

Wasted project, Nick, huh?

Herringbone?!

How did you get in here?

To schmidt.

Sleeping his way to the top.

Cheers to me.

I hope you like it.

I poured that one for you.

Drink it up.

This is coming off weird ... it's creepy, right?

Go get her.

I can't do that.

I can't talk to thirsty.

Thirsty?

I don't know her name, so I call her Thirsty.

Thirsty Mendelson.

Oh, you made her Jewish?

I didn't make her Jewish.

Mendelson? She's not Jewish?

Well, Thirsty. - If her last name's Mendelson, she's Jewish.

Tell you what her first name is, too ... It's Rachel.

Get out of my head ... you're kind of ruining my thing right now.

What I have with thirsty is perfect.

She's surly like I'm surly, and she rolls her eyes at everybody like I roll my eyes at everybody.

She likes to drink in the afternoon.

And I like to drink in the afternoon.

Go talk to her.

No, I can't.

That breaks the first rule of bartending ... never cross the bar.

'Cause once you cross the bar, it gets messy.

Rudy just wants her $200 back.

Come on, neither of you has the right bra for this.

Excuse me, have you seen Rhonda?

Have you seen the ferret lady?

Why am I doing this?!

Never cross the bar.

Your rules have gotten you so far.

Classic Nick Miller.

You got it.

Jess.

You want to help me at the jukebox really quick?

Oh, my God, yes ... I've always wanted to do this with you.

Well, I was gonna go

"Raspberry Beret," but...

If we're gonna go Prince, I think we should go, like ...

Jess, I want to talk to you about your bathtub pitch.

I love baths ... I do.

Back in Latvia, we had a great tub.

But I tell you what ... there are parts of my butt only a tub can clean.

Ew, but okay!

Okay, here's what we're gonna do, so the guys don't know.

We're gonna split the 400 bucks for the tub.

Then we can hide it on the roof and install it in the middle of the night, and then we can just pretend like you did it without our permission.

Or we could just...

say that you wanted a tub, too.

How about we just keep this a Jess and Winston thing?

Hey, Cece, you okay?

Yeah, I'm good.

I'm good;

Just broke up with Robby.

I'll make you a drink.

What ha... what happened?

Um, I told him I had to start getting serious about having kids and he said,

"Okay, that's cool."

But then that's all he said for the next eight hours, and he hasn't said anything to me since.

So terrible.

I just, I can't even...

Mm-hmm.

Wow.

I mean that's... but I mean...

There's... cool. It's cool.

'Cause you're single. You're single.

Really subtle stuff.

She's single now; technically, you're single... are you not single? - Schmidt!

I have to get serious about my future, otherwise my mom is going to set me up with a hundred sweet, gentle, painfully boring Indian guys.

Oh, my God, your mother.

I want to control your life.

That's how my parents met and they had a beautiful, healthy marriage.

I respect your parents ... I do.

I respect everything that ... look what they've created.

Look at that... look at your beauty, with your hair.

I'd eat it out of a bowl, your hair.

I'd put it in a bowl and I'd eat your hair.

Oh, my God.

Hey, Cece.

I-I know it's unexpected that I'm here.

It's because I wanted to tell you something.

You're my boo.

You're my boo and I'm... and I'm...

I been missing you.

I been missing you oh, so long.

You know what's weird? I don't find this weird anymore.

What's your problem, Nick ... how long you been standing there?

How much of that did you hear?

I'm in love, man.

I'm in love with Cece.

Everyone knows that, you dumb-ass.

You always have been.

I gotta tell her, man.

You should do that, Schmidty, that sounds great.

Do I have your blessing?

Do you have my blessing?

Yeah. I don't think you need my blessing, big guy.

Just kind of do your thing. - I would like your blessing. You're my best friend.

I want your blessing. - Schmidt, fine, you got my blessing, okay? Just...

What is this?

Give me a hug. Give me a hug. I need this.

Come on, please, give me, give me a hug, Nick.

Please, just give me a hug! I want ... Ow!

Good stuff.

Thank you, Nick.

Come on!

All right, looks good ... no leaks.

We did it.

Yeah, we did.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

It's flooding!

Do something!

No, no, no, no, no!

I've never wished I was d*ad more.

Schmidt's gonna freak out.

He once told me he spent $300

on a pocket square.

No!

Am I overreacting?

Eh, that's about right.

There you go... good as new.

So, I've, uh, handled this one-man job, any two-man jobs you want us to tackle?

I think we're good. Thanks, Remy.

You sure there's not something else that needs fixing?

Maybe in the... lady's bedroom?

Uh, yeah, I think we're done ... thank you, Remy.

I will return your ladder when I feel like it.

Thank you, bye.

He's so weird.

Um, okay, so, phase two.

Didn't Schmidt make us get renter's insurance when he almost tore down that rafter with the sex swing?

Jess, we fake a robbery.

We fake a robbery for the insurance.

That's a great idea.

We're a couple of meth-heads.

Oh, yeah.

Boom.

Got any meth?

Got any rings on your fingers?

I need them for meth.

Get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all.

Whoa! Do we have to steal my moustache trimmer?

This is worth three bowls of sweet, sweet meth.

This? This?

No.

No. This?

I just don't think the meth-heads would want anything in this room.

What about this?

A land line?

To me, it looks like a meth sandwich.

Don't hog all the meth, daddy.

Did you h*t this already?

No, did you?

No.

What are you doing?

You're smothering me, all right?

I'm done with this!

At least leave your wallet!

I'm out of here!

Would you like a whiskey?

What?

I said that because I know you like whiskey.

You're a whiskey girl, like me.

You're a whiskey girl?

I'm Nick.

I'm Angie.

Angie... Angie, Angie.

Well, what are you standing there for?

Go grab a bottle and get me drunk, idiot.

Well, I-I couldn't drink with you ... I work here.

Just kidding, I get drunk, like, all the time.

I've got a drinking thing.

You got it.

I also have all the access to pistachios if you want, like, a full...

I'll make my own mind up on that.

He took my doctor's appointment suit!

He took El Capitan!

Damn it!

The only thing he left was my summer suit with the lightning bolt on the back.

I keep that in my summer bin along with my summer condoms ... citrus-flavored, for a more refreshing summer experience.

That's a jar...

Jar for sure, yeah.

Look at this ... took my suits.

Left the... left the douche bag jar.

Typical meth-head.

Typical meth-head.

Yeah, it's a shame.

Good thing that I have a security camera in there.

I'm gonna download the footage and I.D. this S.O.B.

He's going down.

I respect the amount you drink ...

Oh, FYI these drinks aren't free.

Wow, well, joke's on you 'cause Mike left with all my money.

Oh, really!

Then how you gonna pay for the drinks?

Oh... probably with sex?

Sorry...

That is not pretty.

Well...

I was gonna let you have sex with Mike.

Oh...

What? It's good.

That was an old switcheroo.

I just want to say you two, uh...

What?

No, no, I don't want to say.

Come on, what?

I don't want to say. I don't feel like it's ...

The point is it's not my...

What are you afraid of?

You're thinking it. - I'm not afraid, but... He's kind of an ass ... damn it!

You think I should break up with Mike?

No, no, that is not my place to...

Well, you did; it is your place.

But I've been drinking with you, and I feel like you're luring me in... Dump his ass!

Damn it.

I can't believe you'd say that to me.

You should mind your own business.

So many years of footage.

This is from last May.

I was trying to add an extra ab muscle.

Jess, I can't take this...

This is when I was experimenting with faux hawks.

I can't, I can't, I can't take it, Jess.

You can.

You're gonna blow this.


My face is numb.

This is when I was lowering my bar sexually.

Why is my face numb?

Okay, I'm gonna say this once.

Tighten up.

Okay, yeah.

I can't believe this is happening.

It's such an important day.

What's happening today?

I just have to look good.

Okay? Not like some Ukrainian dentist.

Oh, my God.

Jess, I'm dying.

What's wrong with you.

I'm dying, Jess.

Jess, pretend you're not seeing this...

Schmidt, this isn't a good time.

Cece, please.

Just... just open the box.

You brought a pigeon into my house?

I couldn't find a dove. Come on, Beatty.

It's... it was supposed to fly out when you opened up the lid.

What are you doing?

I love you, Cece.

And I have been in love with you for so long.

I used to think it was just a heavy like, but...

it's love.

There it goes.

Is this real?

For you?

Yes.

Cece, I'm ready for a serious commitment.

I'm up for a huge promotion at work.

I'm ready to have kids with you, if that's what you want.

You want to have kids?

Let's go right now, let's go make a kid.

Take your top off.

Schmidt, my mother...

she's gonna hate you.

Okay? You're Jewish.

She hates Jews; I mean, she really hates them.

Everybody hates the Jews.

Your mom's in the majority.

I'll convert to Indianism.

Hindi... Hindi-is...eh?

Indiani-Indi... Indi-Buddhi-ism?

Schmidt, we have so much going against us.

Let's have dinner. Tonight.

Okay.

Cool. No, yeah, cool.

Just give me a second.

Ah... yes!

I'm sorry.

Wiston, are you out of your head?

Security camera.

What are you doing? Schmidt has a security camera.

Why did I think he didn't have a security camera?

Oh. You're a briefs man.

I was hoping I'd never find out.

Oh, my goodness, we should not have gone for that tub.

I just like bubbles so much...

Winston, I think you're having a panic att*ck.

Hmm?

Shut up, hey, Jess, no.

I'm, uh... this is just the willies.

The w... the what? The... the willies?

The willies, yeah. It's the same thing that happened when I took my driver's test.

Go ahead and start the car.

No! No!

A lot of people get panic att*cks.

The willies.

My dad used to get them all the time.

Like, every time he had to make a left turn.

It would take him two and a half hours to drive me to school.

We'd just drive all around Portland, making right turns.

Okay.

It's okay.

Okay.

It's really okay.

Are you going to tell anybody about my underwear?

Look, I really want to.

But I won't.

Where is he?

It's over, Mike.

Where's Nick?

Just stop... just stop it.

Hey. You Nick?

Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not Nick.

Nick has pinkeye! I'm Ricardo!

Let Nick go!

Ricardo? Ricardo? This is Nick, huh?

(Speaking fake Spanish)

You're a d*ad man!

I had it handled!

He was gonna k*ll you. I've seen him do it.

I know someone at work who can stitch him up. - Okay, let's get him stitched up right now. This is disgusting. - Okay.

I'm out there every night,

balling to the max, and you expect me to do what, just stop and chew up some cherry-flavored multi-V?

No, thanks.

I'll take my vitamins on the rocks. Double V.

Heart. Spirit. Body. Party.

You gotta get specific about this vodka.

Have you tried Double V?

No.

Let's open up this bitch.

Let's open up... okay.

Um... I kind of...

We're going to do every vitamin, in alphabetical order. Each sh*t that you do, makes me know you're going that extra mile.

Emma, I really... - Is there something more important than work?

What?

Okay.

But you said ...

No, I... no, no, no.

Let's-let's just... all right, we'll do it.

Don't feel weird, Winston.

Everybody has their weird thing.

Even me.

Look, I'm gonna tell you something about myself.

I am really claustrophobic.

Jess, I don't believe you.

No, seriously, watch.

You seem fine to me.

I seem fine, but if I close the door, it's gonna feel like I'm dying...

even more than a real death.

It just feels like death... plus more death.

Okay, this is silly. Just come on.

But I'm gonna be okay, because I know you're out there.

Mm-hmm.

And you can help me...

Oh, my God...

Okay...

Oh, my God. Let me out!

Jess, this is not... this is not funny, Jess.

Can you open up the door?

Jess?

It's closed!

Oh, my God, Jess, the door is stuck.

It's so hot in here!

Jess, the door is stuck!

Oh, my God! - Jess, come on, now, this is not funny.

Oh, my God... Oh, my God... Oh!

Jess, this is not... oh, my goodness, is it hot?

So you're not a nurse?

Who said I was a nurse?

Stitches ... you said somebody at work can do stitches.

Who does stitches at a strip club?

Someone need stitches?

Let me get my needle and my bifocals.

Be right back.

Okay, let's get you down right next to that dirty pole.

There? That? Okay, good.

Th... really nice place.

Uh, this is where you work.

You the ticket-taker?

No, I'm a stripper.

Yeah.

But what is it that you do here?

Stripper. - Because college is so expensive these days...

I'm a stripper.

But only topless.

Completely naked.

Mike, where's my taco?

What happened? What happened?

Uh, he remembered that he was married to you, so he tried to b*at the memory out of his brain with a brick.

Oh, he's married...

You stupid bitch!

Oh, not okay!

Ladies! Stop fighting!

Hey, hey! Stop this now!

Don't stop this! I'm super aroused!

I think I just became a dirt bag.

Why did I cross the bar?

I did it.

I'm here for dinner. I made it.

It's really late.

We got the account. I was with my boss, we got the account.

We did it.

You were with your boss?

What?

No. - The woman who made you sign a contract so she could have sex with you, your boss? - No.

No. Uh...

Yeah.

Yeah.

No... but nothing happened.

She just wanted me to taste the V.

That came out wrong.

Yeah.

I thought about...

I thought about the boss's boobs once.

They're still real nice, but I didn't have no connection to them emotionally, whatsoever.

Nothing.

Cece, I can pay for our baby's college now.

Literally anywhere they want to go.

UCLA, UMass... any of the U schools.

I love you so much.

You should probably...

Oh, not...

It's okay.

Cece, I'm gonna pee in my summer suit.

Hey, Mom, it's me.

I think I'm ready to have you set me up.

This is not a prank. Call me back.

Oh, thank God.

Oh, my goodness.

Thank you, man.

I see.

If you guys have been playing hard to get, you don't have to.

I am totally ready to get mixed up in this choco-vanilla shake.

No.

Yeah, you know what I'm talking about here.

I'm just talking about...

Yes... I know, I know.

We got it, we got it, Remy.

...doing it with-with both of you.

We got it. Yeah.

Three...

This never happened.

Jess, I just want to say thank you.

You know, I thought I was the only crazy one, but it turns out you're nuts as well.

Oh, I'm straight-up bananas, Winston.

Next time that happens to you, just come to me, and I'll help you keep your pants on.

So what are we gonna do about Schmidt's suits?

I feel like there's a very obvious solution.

Oh, come on! Again?

Thank God. The meth-heads came back.

They brought your suits back

'cause they don't fit them.

They did the right thing,

'cause they're drug addicts, they're not monsters.

Right.

They actually got them dry-cleaned, um...

deluxe package, very pricey.

Why'd he tie you up?

They kept saying, like,

"Ah, I'm so hungry for more meth," you know?

"Let's get rid of these suits.

These clean... suits."

Jess and I want a tub.

We want candles and bubbles.

Oh, damn it, Schmidt, we want bubbles, man.

I want to cover everything up on my body with bubbles.

You know, and then just blow 'em off like this...

and laugh, like...

Get a tub, man. Let's get a tub; I don't care.

Hey.

You okay?

What's wrong?

I told Cece that I loved her.

Then I got drunk, and she called her mom, and...

She's going brown.

She wants to marry a brown man.

Schmidt...

Schmidt!

Hey, man.

Hey...

Hey, hey, hey.

Hold it right there.

Let it go, man.

Let it go.

Okay.

How'd you guys get out of your ties?

Hey...

Hey.

What can I get you to drink, Angie?

Oh, no, I don't...

I just want to... hang out.

I've got this rule.

Never cross the bar.

And I broke that rule, and...

Look, these 18 inches of oak are the only thing that separates me from guys like Sid over there.

No disrespect. I got your next round.

Well, I don't have any rules.

Don't do... don't...

No customers...behind the bar.

Oh, Sid, you gotta... You're k*lling me.

Sit down and drink your beer.

I'm a man with feelings.

Feelings that are bubbling up inside of me, and...they're about to explode.

I'd like for those feelings to explode on you.

You got this, dawg. Look at you, dawg.

Look at you!

Look at your face, dawg!

Look at your face!

You got this, son!

âª Well, I love you âª
âª And I've never said those words âª
âª Well, I love you, from the bo... âª

To my dear friends, Melissa and Sadie.

Aw.

Five years together.

That is awesome.

Hear, hear.

What is your secret?

I don't really think there is a secret. I think it's just about...

love, understanding, and...

two sets of boobs.

I love boobs. I love 'em.

I love... - Okay

...everything about 'em. - Yeah, I do, too.

All different kinds.

Yeah, that's my thing too.

I love them.

And the Curiosity Rover has touched down on the planet of Mars.

What's happening right now?

What's happening in there?

Schmidt's in there with his boss.

He's entertaining her.

Ew.

I don't care what he does.

I just don't understand why he has to narrate it!

Robot arm engaged!

It's just engaged now?

So he's saying everything up to this point has been foreplay?

Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous.

What are you gonna do for 20 minutes of foreplay?

Boring! Yawn!

Am I right, ladies?

So, I actually know what's about to happen next.

You will all want to cover your ears.

I found water!

No, I didn't do it in time.

Oh, he found...

Has anybody seen a movie in the last five months, and can you describe the plot in great detail and loudly?

Okay, you're dry.

Actually, I'm good. Thank you.

Come on. I spent six dollars on this wine.

I've been looking for the right time to tell you tonight, but Melissa and I are so excited because... Wow.

That is so upsetting.

What mission is this based on?!

I'm pregnant! We are pregnant!

Wha...?

Lesbian baby. Congratulations, you guys.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

I feel so lucky, you know?

Like I really tucked this one in just under the wire.

What do you mean? You're so young.

As your friendly neighborhood gynecologist, you should know that by the time a lady hits 30, she loses about

90% of her eggs.

What? No, th-that can't be true.

What?

Did you know that there's a test that you can take that tells you how many beans you got left in your bean sack?

Ovaries.

It estimates basically how many childbearing years you have left.

Yeah, get this baloney:

I'm 32, but my eggs are 48, and my vag*na is 97.

I am so uncomfortable.

But it gets better with age ... it's like the vag*na Helen Mirren.

Oh, boy.

I've got big plans for the centennial.

When can I take that test?

Who cares?

Personally, I'm still on the please-God-I-hope-

I'm-not-pregnant phase.

What am I doing here?

You know, just clinically speaking, it's probably a good idea to know.

I want to take this test! Like, now.

Can we take this test right now?

Morning, ladies.

And Nick.

Morning?

Well, I mean, I work nights now, so I'm on an adjusted sleeping schedule.

I just woke up, here's my breakfast, I'm going to work.

Take me with you! They're talking about vaginas!

I hate it! Take me with you!

Our bodies really made something.

I feel like we brought manufacturing jobs back to America.

Yeah, it was fine.

What do you mean "fine"?

I broke your brain, girl.

How do I put this delicately?

I was...

nowhere close to finishing.

I was bored.

And cold.

That's cool. Uh...

No, yeah.

World shattered.

We'll try again. It'll be better.

The world I once lived in... shattered.

All right, see you at work.

See you at work.

Put me on the air.

I got something to say

about Andrew Bynum's hair.

All right, caller, you're up next.

Look at you, man. This is great.

You're the king of your own castle.

Look at this. What is this?

Why do you need so many pens, you big sh*t?

I like what I do, man. I finally feel like my life is moving in the right direction.

That is what I don't have in my life.

But not anymore.

I'm gonna take one of these pens, I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write my zombie novel.

You don't think I can do it, do you?

You know, it's not that. It's just that sometimes I get the feeling that you...

don't want to write.

No more excuses. I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write that novel.

And I'll be the first to read it.

We got a deal, friend.

Deal.

Yeah, you still have me on the line.

My two cents? He's never gonna write that book.

Why don't you shut up, Manny from Cerritos?- Okay.

Who asked you? Hang up the phone.- All right.

We should go.

Melissa's been drinking for two.

Three.

Awesome night, ladies.

Educational. Thank you.

Sorry. I'm just...

Okay. I'm sorry.

What?

Sadie, before you leave, can I just ask you a few questions?

I know where this is going.

You are a gynecologist

and a lesbian, which makes you...

well, a va-genius.

Jar.

I know my way around a Grizzly Adams.

You, too? Jar.

Wh...

As an adult male, I would like to ask you a few questions about, you know, the downstairs girl cookie.

Jars, jars, all around jars!

This is my personal time right now.

You can make an appointment at my office, pay your $40 co-pay.

I will be happy to answer your questions.

Yes! I'm in. Please.

Now, would I have to put my legs up in the stirrups?

Why would you?

I'm asking more so out of curiosity than fear. #excitement.

Are you done?

I'm done. I'll see you, okay?

I'm gonna call the office.

Okay.

Well, thank you, guys, for the...

awesome drunky thing and the weirdly sobering end.

Look, I know Sadie freaked you out with all this talk about tests, but I just want to remind you that at the end of the day, it's all about love.

I mean, I love Sadie.

I want my babies to have her beautiful face.

As long as they don't get her big, fat man-feet.

Yuck. Fingers crossed we go donor on that one.

Okay.

Let's make a graceful exit, my love.

Okay.

Hey, get out of here, you crazy lesbos, with your baby-making!

Ooh!

Whoo!

Ah! I'm married;

I'm not d*ad!

See you. Night.

Drive safely.

90% of our eggs, huh?

That's crazy. I'm panicking.

You panicking?

God, no. Babies wreck you, Jess.

They literally eat your body.

I'm 30, I'm single, and I just started a new job.

Tonight I used a bread roll to wipe butter off my face, and then I ate the bread roll, so I essentially used my face as a butter Kn*fe.

I don't think I'm ready to bring new life into the world, but...

what if all that's left are the weird eggs?

And the evil eggs?

You have no evil eggs.

I can feel them. They're turning.

They watched their brothers and sisters die, and now they want to be birthed.

I need to be fertilized.

Fertilize me, Los Angeles!

Calm down, all right?

You're overreacting.

I am overreacting! You know why?

Because I want a family.

I want to give my nipples a purpose.

Give my nipples a purpose!

Oh, yeah!

Oh, God, that was a mistake.

Duck down. That was a mistake.

We're taking that test.

Well I think that you guys made a really smart decision coming in here today.

Sadie, once at a senior graduation party, I sat in a very hot Jacuzzi for... 12 hours.

Is there any chance that I sunny-side upped my eggs?

No, Jess.

Oh, between the years of 1998 and 2005, I used a lot of self-tanner.

Like, a lot.

Is that a possibility of, um...

Do I... Okay.

Nope.

Here we go.

I once fell on a pommel horse...

I'm gonna call you when I get the results.

This is good.

I got nothing. This is...

Whoa, whoa, Jess, what are you doing?

That's my ketchup collection!

This fertility Web site says I need to get rid of anything with toxins.

Did you put the microwave in the trash?

Yes.

Why would you do that?

Microwaves zap things!

You can't take my microwave away!

Zap my insides!

It's the only thing I love!

I can't risk it!

It's what makes burritos delicious!

I don't care!

You care about your burritos more than my children, Nick?

You're putting me in a tough spot.

Friends, I'm in a real-life sex pickle.

My inability to satisfy Emma has thoroughly rocked me.

I've tried everything.

How about now?

Hold on. I'm Shazam-ing this song.

Oh, for crying out loud!

Guess what I'm worried about?

This sound.

You know what that sound is?

It's the sound of an empty uterus.

I don't need test results to tell me that it is The Grapes

of Wrath in there.

It is 1930s Dust Bowl in there, Schmidt.

And they're all walking with limps.

I can top that easily. I'm having a hard time with my zombie novel.

Oh, not this...

Are you literally comparing a zombie novel to my ability to create life?

I'm a writer, Jess. We create life.

Ugh! Being a woman sucks!

Preaching to the choir. Women are the worst.

Seriously, can you please stop yelling?

All right, now, it's no big deal, but I'm on an adjusted schedule.

Sorry about this. Jess has absolutely lost her mind.

I have not lost my mind!

Yeah, you have.

I'm just scared!

Would you trust me?

You're gonna be fine.

You're gonna meet somebody and...

you're gonna fall in love and then...

before you know it, you're gonna...

With who, Nick?

Who's gonna... lay a flag down on this sweet, sweet continent?

I'll man up. But I must warn you, Jess ... I don't have sperms.

I have tadpoles.

Of the gods.

That's right.

And I'm gonna give 'em to you.

You can have 'em all, for all I care.

That's how much I love you.

I feel your pain in this situation.

I want you to have babies.

Take my sperms.

No. It should be me, Jess.

What?

With your big, beautiful blue eyes and my...Blair Underwood-like skin, Mm-hmm.

We'd have the most beautiful baby the world has ever seen. - He's not wrong.

It could get into any school it wants.

Mm-hmm.

To be clear, I haven't asked any of you to impregnate me.

I think it's important that that's been said.

Good, 'cause it's definitely not me.

Good, 'cause it's definitely not you.

I would love that little baby with all my heart.

Even if I did show it by picking him up from school in my underwear and...

hitting on the crossing guard.

How's the zombie novel coming? Good, good, good.

I haven't written a word.

Wait, are you serious?

Nick, it's not that hard, man.

Just sit down and write.

You ain't Hemingway.

You boys are right.

Mm-hmm.

I got to be more like Hemingway.

I just lost another one of my eggs while you were comparing yourself to the most famous writer of all time.

Maybe the reason I have writer's block is I've been living too casual with you clowns.

I need real-life adventure like Ernest Hemingway had at my age.

Man, I got to run with the bulls.

I got to k*ll a man with my bare hands after making sweet love to him and then sleep on the warm belly of his horse.

I got to eat my way out of a sandwich house!


How much you know about Hemingway?

Not a lot! But I'm gonna learn!

I'm becoming Ernest Hemingway.

You idiots.

Schmidt.

Yo.

Okay, Schmidt.

Female pleasure.

Here are some diagrams, so we can see where you're at.

The vag*na.

I'm familiar.

Good.

Now, what I typically do is I start over here, and then I move here once I feel confident that this area has been taken care of.

Yeah, see, that's exactly what I do.

I call that "Losing Nemo."

Well, a more advanced move would be...

You know what? I'll just show you.

It's sort of... Come in this way.

No, no, I see what you're doing. That asymmetry right there?

That's crucial.

'Cause then what I'll do is is I'll go outside, get the paper, and shake the neighbor's hand.

Interesting.

Then what I'll do is, I'll tie a bow on it because it's birthday time.

Then I get onstage and collect my Oscar and say thank you to the people, thank you to the people, then get back down offstage and get everybody into the sharing circle, right down there in the sharing circle, and then...

spike the volleyball.

Then what I like to do is, I like to arrive at the bridge, meet the troll, and then answer his riddles three.

Then what we do is, we're dancing.

We're just gonna dance, we're gonna dance for a while.

We'll dance until you can't dance anymore, dancing till you can't dance anymore, and then everybody gets a churro.

You okay?

Mm-hmm.

It's the baby hormones.

They are not as gay as me.

So I'm good at this, right?

Schmidt, in my professional opinion, you have definitely earned the rank of ...

and I will use the phrase you coined ... va-genius.

Thank you, thank you so much.

I really needed to hear that, Sadie.

You got to go.

Hey, Winston,

we're going on an adventure!

We need real-life experience like Hemingway.

Whoo, I feel like Hemingway.

This is life experience?

Yeah, the zoo is the best we can do, I told you, but it's got everything we need.

It's got life, animals, man, beast.

Look, I'm sorry, dude, it's just, you know, I'm not supposed to be awake right now because of my adjusted...

Adjusted schedule, yeah.

Hey, man, 13

minutes of sleep.

Honestly, Nick, seriously,

13 minutes of sleep ... that's all I got.

You're starting to look like a pillow to me.

All I can think of is, like,

"Man, Nick looks exactly like a pillow to me."

Hmm, what'd you say? Winston, you need some sleep.

But I'm out here with you.

Yeah.

Okay, because I love you.

Thank you.

And I want you to finish your zombie book.

Okay, but check out where we are.

This is experience, this is what's f*ring me up to get back to writing.

This is kind of what it's all about.

What are you doing?

It's writer's fuel.

That's what Hemingway said.

Sadie, um, hey.

Uh, I just, I just want you to know that I am, um, I'm like ...

I am okay with whatever you tell me.

I'm just like, if you say you've got a year, that's fine.

If you say, like, "You can have kids till you're 80,"

that's fine, too. If you say, "You are barren,"

um, I'm, I'm okay with that, too.

Um, just, why am I the only one talking?

Just lay it on me.

What's inside my body?

Everything looks good, Jess.

Your hormone levels are outstanding.

What?

Actually these are off the charts for someone your age.

I mean, I don't know how you're walking around with this many eggs.

âª I'm the egg queen âª
âª I'm queen âª
âª of the eggs. âª

Right.

Cece.

Mm-hmm.

You know what? Maybe we should talk in private.

Cece, Cece.

Cece, wait, do you want to talk?

Jess, you don't get it.

Sadie basically just told me that if I want to have a kid, I've got to start right now.

Right now.

I thought I had all of this time.

I didn't want to have to think about this.

I know, I know, I'm sorry.

I made you take the test.

What can I do?

Make me a guy so I don't have to worry about this.

You know what? Yes.

Yeah, let's be guys just for today.

Let's, let's care about stupid things, talk about sharks and sci-fi movies and making everything wireless.

"Dude, my phone is wireless, my computer is wireless.

Everything's wireless, yeah."

You're a terrible guy.

"Come on."

No, I'm the best guy.

Come on, come on.

All right.

Okay, how was that?

Eh.

Why, though, with the "eh"?

Unbelie ... but I played out your most secret fantasy:

French maid handyman does...

Studio 54...

Studio 54 busboy.

I know, it's disappointing.

I thought I k*lled it.

And I picked you at work because I heard you were amazing in bed.

I ... no, no, no, I am, okay, I know that I am.

I have it on good authority from my model ex-girlfriend and an actual lesbian gynecologist that I know exactly what I'm doing, so it's got to be you.

It's us ... this doesn't work.

When I got divorced I-I, I thought I could go out there and have all these new experiences ...

the contract of sex with someone at work who's so far beneath me, you know, someone basically just powerless.

I guess I have to feel something.

Okay, see, I'm not like that.

I don't even understand that concept.

My ex-girlfriend the model ... she's a model.

I know she's a model.

We'd have sex, and it was just like, I was happy, you know, I, I...

We were connected, I wasn't thinking about anything.

What is that?

That is love, you idiot.

That's love.

Yuck.

It sucks.

So, what, do I have to, I have to, like, be in love now to have good sex?

Think about me ... I got to go out in the world and meet people, date.

You're going to be great.

You think?

Yeah.

Consider our sex contract void.

How am I gonna get the feathers off?

I have no idea.

Jess and that girl!

Uh...

Oh, I'm so glad they're here.

So you're getting a lot of work done here, huh?

Who wins ... me versus gorilla? Go.

Gorilla.

Me versus gorilla.

Gorilla.

No, but in a contest.

Gorilla.

Yeah, but in a competition.

Uh, gorilla.

You don't get it.

Okay, are you just drunk at the zoo right now?

Let's go look at snakes.

Okay.

Where are the snakes?!

All day.

You know what?

I don't think we should act like the guys.

Jess, what am I going to do?

What am I going to tell Robby?

You are a Mexican West Coast rattlesnakes, and they call you "fang-tastic."

No one ever calls me anything like that.

Nick, what are you doing?

This is not life experience;

This is procrastination at the zoo.

I don't think it is.

Now, I need some sleep.

I got to work tonight.

Okay, congratulations, I'm glad you found your passion... - Okay, look...and that you love what you do.

Wow.

But enough's enough.

Don't throw it in my face.

Is it like that, is it like that, Nick?

Don't throw it in my face.

Nick, I got off my adjusted schedule...

Don't say "adjusted schedule."

That's super annoying.

Adjusted schedule.

Stop saying it.

Adjusted schedule.

You say it again, I'm gonna let the snakes out.

Adjusted schedule. Let the snakes out.

I will let...

These guys have done a pretty good job keeping it sealed. - Yeah, yeah.

Nick, you're not a finisher.

Oh, I'm a finisher.

You're not a finisher at all, man.

That's why you didn't finish law school.

Don't do that.

The same reason you're only three episodes into Downton Abbey.

There's just too many characters, it's hard to follow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, man, you're scared, and that's okay ... be scared.

Just stop wasting my time because I'm tired and I need to sleep because I want to work tonight at the job I'm passionate about.

I'm glad you called me;

I love the zoo.

You think I'm like a bear?

I mean, I kind of move like a bear, and I got that really long, sharp toenail that you love so much.

Hey.

Randa.

It says here you're 43.

Keeping it tight, girl.

What do you think of kids?

I love kids.

I would like to have children someday.

Someday?

Well, yeah, like in ten years or something.

Yeah.

I have a lot of eggs.

Unfortunately I don't have a lot of sausage.

Yeah, I shouldn't be complaining.

I'll be okay.

Hey, Winston.

Aah, what?

Sorry to wake you.

- Z is for Zombie.

What?

I finished my novel.

I stayed up for 14 straight hours.

I even peed in water bottles.

We have a bathroom.

Wow, you dedicated it to me.

"To Winston. Have a nice summer.

Hope to see you ag..."

Really?

I just want to say right now, the black guy dies early ...

his name is William ...

but don't take offense;

It's a staple of the genre.

I can't take this ... too much anxiety.

I'm going to my room.

Hey, Winston, are you reading it?

Hey.

Oh, hey.

I knew it.

I knew you'd choose me to get you pregnant.

Yep, let's go.

Jess.

Schmidt.

I think I may have been in love with Cece.

You are in love with Cece.

You think?

Can't believe I have to have feelings to have good sex.

I was hoping I'd be d*ad before this happened.

Hey, why are we all hanging out in my room and sitting on my bed?

Nick, this is the worst thing I have ever read in my entire life.

You misspelled the word "rhythm"

38 times.

- Z is for Zombie?

Yeah, Z Is for Zombie.

The zombie novel.

Yeah.

"Rhythm" is a tough word.

Don't feel bad about that.

Yeah, thanks, man.

Did you get to the word search?

Yeah.

I put a word search in the novel, but the joke's on you.

There aren't any words in there, so you're just gonna be staring at letters, you idiot.

But you know what? You finished it, and for that, my friend, I'm proud of you.

Thank you, I did finish it, I finished something.

Yeah, you finished something.

Read it out loud, Winston.

Read it out loud.

Read it out loud.

Read it out loud... - Okay, I'll read this damn thing; you asked for it.

This might be humiliating.

"No one in the sleepy mountain town of 'Writhe-em' City..."

That's Rhythm City.

"...knew what the meteor meant, but the one thing Mike Jr. did have was a whole lot of 'rittems.'"

Rhythm. - No, yeah.

"'Whoa, what bit me in the face?' Mike Jr. said to his dad Mike Sr., who sucks."

Sucks ... Mike Sr. sucks.

It's a major theme throughout this.

"Mike Sr. sucks a whole bunch, much more than his neighbor Rallo."

Never stop reading this.

"'Zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo.

"'Who let them zombies out that damn zombie zoo?

Uh-oh, watch your back, Laura.'"

And I guess Laura is another character that he introduces, but that's it.

And here's the word search.

Yeah, good luck, you idiot.

Jess, I'm not done with that.

That's $18 granola ... handmade.

$18 for granola?

Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.

Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?

Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.

Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00

and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30

and he's gonna stay till 7:30.

I should also warn you guys that my mom's a little bit perky.

Wait, you think she's perky?

Well, she doesn't have my dark side.

I got that from my dad.

Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.

He's so unhappy.

I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.

I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.

Oh, that's her.

It's okay, man.

What's okay, man?

Oh.

Momsicle.

Oh, Jujube.

Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.

Every year.

Hello, everyone.

This is my mom Joan.

Hi.

This is everybody.

Hi.

Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.

Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.

Do it, come on.

Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.

Come on, Cece, you know how to do this. - Yep.

You in the white shirt.

I don't do hug b*lls.

Come on in.

Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.

Okay.

All right.

Whoo!

Oh, dear God.

A hug ball?

Dad.

Well, hello, Bob.

You're early.

You know what I'm thankful for today?

Divorce.

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess.

No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.

I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.

Bob, just stay.

What if we need something ruined?

Mom!

It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop...

No...

sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.

I probably won't want to blow my head off.

Bob, we are both grown-ups.

We can make it through one day together.

Please, Dad.

Well done, Jessica Day.

Pardon?

"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30."

I have no idea what you're talking about.

The movie you made me watch a million times.

Rocky IV?

- Parent Trap.

What? I don't...

Mm-hmm.

Why would I do that?

Parent Trap ...  crazy.

Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.

He's trying to get us to eat candy.

Jess, Jess. Jess?

Jess, are you okay?

What's the matter? Are you...?

Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.

Smile, Mom, you still got it.

Jessica, what are you doing?

I want him to see what he's missing.

You're texting your father?!

That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.

Just go.

Excuse me.

What's with all the crappy beer, man?

You hate that stuff.

Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.

Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.

It's been that way since we were kids.

Made my life a living hell.

I'm the strong kind of fat.

Yes, yes, yes!

Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.

He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.

Okay. - He settled down with this great woman named Krista.

She's coming.

Actually went Legoltod with them last year.

He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides I wasn't comfortable with.

Ho! Ha-ha.

How you doing, little buddy?

Come here.

Oh!

Oh!

Okay.

Hey.

What's up, man? Winston.

Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.

I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.

There can only be one ... you know the rule.

Ah! Look at that right there.

That's...

Where's Krista?

Krista and I have a new arrangement.

Okay.

I, uh, I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.

Hey, Dad, you want to help us?

I have to stay away from salmonella.

You don't have to lick it, Bob.

No, no, no, my doctor says...

It was a joke, it was just a joke.

I have a sense of humor.

If that was a joke, here is a pencil.

Draw me a map to the joke.

Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.

Mom. you're in a great place with your practice.

Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you, but it's been months.

Jess.

What are you...?

I'm sorry, I thought, I thought, I ... I'm s ... I thought everyone knew.

You grieved so publicly on Instagram ...

all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.

Katherine cheated?

Yeah.

Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.

Yeah.

No, really, I had no idea.

Yeah, well, yeah.

Oh, sorry, really.

Come here, come here, let me...

Salmonella...

Salmonella.

Okay.

I liked her.

You did?

No, no.

I didn't think so.

Hey, remember that song, huh?

Sure, Bob.

Yeah.

Do I remember that?

That was the night.

Great night.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

I'm not talking about the concert.

No, the after ... the afterparty.

The afterparty.

The after ... yeah.

Jess, no.

Parent trap.

Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.

Okay, I'm out of here.

Sit down, sit down.

I'm not doing a parent trap.

Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.

I think this could really make them happy.

They need us. Here's the plan:

We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.

Your parent trap ... there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?

Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.

The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.

A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.

I feel like you're just throwing this together.

This is a makeshift parent trap;

They don't work.

Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?

I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me. I ruin things.

Let's do this parent trap.

Yes.

Oh, would you look at that?

She's spectacular. Wow.

Well, you know, we used to date, right?

You, Schmiggle?

Schmidt.

Please.

Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?

And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.

You mean, you ran away scared.

Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.

Okay, yeah, and you are?

Damn right I am.

Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.

I'm listening. - Go on.

The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.

Yes. - It is on.

What are you doing?

I'm bored.

Nice.

Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis...

d*ad.

And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell ... d*ad.

d*ad. You know what I mean?

Who-Who's going to speak out for us, I mean, the voice of the NFL ... Steve Sabol? d*ad.

Also d*ad.

Exactly.

You know, it doesn't take a genius. All you got to do is follow the money.

Always follow the money.

That's what I always say.

You always follow the money.

Yeah, yeah.

Oil companies.

Pharmaceuticals.

Big business, chicken corporations.

Corn.

Yeah.

Just explain to me again why we're doing this.

Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.

And I want to help her realize her dreams.

Yeah, it's my plan B.

Okay, stop. Seriously, it's just too much.

The makeup and-and your dress?

The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.

So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?

Sorry.

I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.

Oh, really? - Yeah.

What's it about?

It's about zombies.

Zombies?

And it's a relationship story.

It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.

The love story's between... whom?

The zombie and Carol.

Zombie and the-the... Carol is not a zombie?

She's a regular person?

No, she's a rich girl.

Oh, so it's like the Twilight

thing where...

It's not like the Twilight...

No, it isn't.

Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.

You don't really... you don't get it.

It's the same thing.

Oh, really?

Is there another guy on Twilight,

that there's a bit of a love triangle with?

Yes.

It's the same as Twilight...

Does Twilight have a wolf in it?

Yes.

It does?

Yes.

Is Twilight in Seattle?

Yes!

Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.

Um, listen, I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth ...

Did you drive my van?

Joan, I have told you this.

It wasn't me.

Okay, I believe you.

I know it was you.

Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.

The trap has been set.

Is is working?

Mm-hmm.

Croce makes my mom frisky.

Check it out.

Oh, hey, your mom looks great.

Really?

Go h*t on her.

What?

My dad gets super jealous.

So if you go lay some sweet game on her...

Go h*t on your mother?

I was going to make Schmidt do it.

No, no, no, I can't h*t on...

Hey, Mom. Mom, uh, Jess...

Nick was just saying that your dÃ©colletage looks bewitching in that dress.

Right, Nick?

Thank you.

I like your de, uh...

your de... de-college.

Say hello to my sister wives, Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.

All right, time for delts?

Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

I'm slowly regretting this.

Definition is for chicks, man.

All right, it's all about size.

I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.

Stupid.

What's your calf situation like?

Calves? Want to see some ankle circles?

Look at that. Some donkey raises?

One, two...

No, no, no, no, no. Wheelbarrow.

What's a wheelbarrow?

Wheelbarrow.

Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.

Put your hands on the ground.

Hand on the ground.

Hey! All right.

Turn him around. Faster.

Yeah, all right.

Come on, man, really work those calves.

Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.

No, I got it all day, man.

All day, I don't even think about it.

That's awesome. Keep going.

All day. I can do this all day, Winston.

I got all day, too!

Hey, how long can you do this for?

I can do this all day!

Yeah, I got all day, too!

Winston!

Why are you yelling at me?

I'll do this all day!

I'll do it all day, Winston!

This is great.

I'll do it all day, Winston!

Joan, I've got to say you are great...

at doing what you're doing.

You got those beautiful strong arms.

You want to give it a try? - Okay.

Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.

Well, no, no, no...

Is that good?

You're wasting it.

Oh, sorry, then show me.

Mm, yeah.

Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.

There you go.


What is happening?

I can feel the chemistry from here.

I sprayed all over.

Clean up time.

Like, whoa.

Jess, what are you doing?

Watching the game.

You're doing the parent trap thing again.

What? Dad...

Yes.

I have a master's degree.

I'm not parent trapping.

You're such a liar.

Seriously, I'm not... Okay. Fine, you're right.

You need help.

Why do I do that?

I don't understand. Every time, it never worked out.

Okay, I'm calling it off. Nick.

âª Every time I try to tell you âª
âª The words just come out wrong âª

Nick!

âª So I have to say "I love you" âª
âª In a song.

Nick!

I love that.

Nick! Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.

She's doing another one of her parent traps.

Can I top you off?

Yes, please.

Hey, Nick, what are you doing?

I don't know, Jessica.

I'm a little bit confused.

I think I'm into your mother.

What?!

I don't know how it happened.

In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.

I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey...

Nick, this is not what we talked about.

I know but it got...

Give me that baster.

No!

Okay, everyone.

This bird needs to go back in the oven.

Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.

Come on.

Brand-new shirt.

Do I regret it? Yes.

Would I do it again? Probably.

It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.

You want, you can go back to your basting.

What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?

Of that idiot? What, are you kidding me?

You know, she's really got to stop doing this.

She's so stubborn.

Wonder where she got that?

Did she ever text you some photos?

You mean of you in the shower?

Yeah.

I got 'em.

I was just wondering.

Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.

Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.

I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.

You belched longer, he farted louder.

You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.

You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.

I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?

Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.

Ready to see who blacks out first?

All right, you know what, forget it.

Whatever, I-I give.

Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

Wow.

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

Yeah, but know this, all right.

Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.

Manhood today is about exfoliation, Ha!

And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.

And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.

You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.

A refined and enlightened pescetarian.

About 90% of the time.

Observe.

What are you doing?

Don't touch the blade ... it's hot.

A classic julienne.

Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.

And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.

Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

That's the sound of round two.

Perfection.

This is a masterpiece right here.

Who's hungry, right?

I am starving.

Well, it makes sense with you two.

You guys must've worked up an appetite.

What?

Look at that plating.

It's like Picasso.

It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.

He is still relevant.

Where? Phoenix?

Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.

What don't you guys just stay here?

I'll sleep on the couch.

What? What are you saying?

What?

Nothing happened.

What are you saying? What are you saying?

I'm with you.

You shouldn't be saying anything...

Anything,

'cause I don't know anything.

'Cause you're not... you don't have any information about anything.

Information at all.

Nothing.

Happened.

The answer is nothing.

What?

Answer me a question.

Which one of these platings is more masculine?

Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?

Being secure in your masculinity.

How do we prove that?

I'm super secure.

You kiss a man.

Yeah.

If you want to be the one true Schmidt. I mean...

No. We don't.

I'll kiss a man.

I'll kiss a man. Yeah, I'll kiss a man.

Winston. Yeah, he'd do.

Winston?

I could go for some stuffing right now. Am I right?

Yeah, love me some stuffing.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, right? - Yeah, let's go.

I'll kiss Winston.

I'll do it.

I'll kiss Winston all day.

I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.

Let's do it.

All day I'll kiss Winston...

Everybody else really hot, too?

Oh, wow.

Hey. Ooh!

Thank you.

Manly.

Beautiful.

Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.

Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate it.

Okay? For you to have.

I appreciate that.

Just make sure you take... that's right...

What are we having here, turkey sushi?

What is this?

Ooh.

I'm gonna make a toast.

Parent Trap's just a movie.

And real relationships are not like that.

They're more complicated than that.

And they're not even real twins.

Twins! Yes!

I'm thankful for twins. They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.

Schmidts.

What?!

What?

In conclusion...

I want to say what I'm thankful for.

Family.

They said... it couldn't be done.

They said,

"You're crazy, Jess."

I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.

Whoa, honey, what?

Whoa, hey, hey, wait. What are you saying?

Congratulations, guys. We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.

No, no, no, no, no.

We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.

It was the greatest day of my entire life.

Greatest day of mine.

There was so much love there.

And sex. Sex energy, too, Jess.

And se-sex.

You lit this place on f*re, you two animals.

It was just a kiss.

It was a great kiss.

It was a hookup. It mean nothing.

Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs, I volunteer.

I volunteer, too.

I volunteered first.

Don't even matter.

You can't volunteer right after...

I'm in the game now.

You just wanted me for my body.

Yup.

And I'm fine with that.

Joanie, what if it was like that?

That's not bad.

I saw something. You guys had a spark, you connected.

Let's get natural. Bring it to you.

I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.

I think you could make each other happy.

I'm serious. No. What? Let me finish.

Jess, you got to let it go, okay?

No, I'm not letting it go!

You have to admit that...

No.

What? ...

they're never gonna make it work.

No.

And you scratched my van.

Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.

I knew it. I knew it.

Didn't I tell you? I knew it.

Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!

Oh. Oh, my God.

Honey, are you an addict? Oh, this is new information.

It was a brownie. I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.

Yes. What, are you living with drug dealers?

When can we start eating?

Are you into pot? Is this a rehab?

What are you doing?

Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?

I don't sell my body for rent, no!

When can we start eating?

It's off. Off.

Shut up, everybody!

I just want to be a family.

Jess.

You have a family.

Your father and I are not getting back together.

Never.

Jess.

Honey?

Where you going?

Jess?

Turkey.

Jess. Honey, can I come in?

Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't,

'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.

I just...

I thought...

maybe you guys could make each other happy.

We're actually happier apart.

Maybe I just worried that...

since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.

You're not gonna be alone.

Even if you were, you could always move in with me.

We could get a condo in Miami.

Mm.

And start solving crimes together.

God, you have to lighten up, Jess.

It's just life.

Yeah, you know what?

We could definitely

Grey Gardens

the crap out of a condo in Miami.

Can't wait to eat cat food with you.

I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

And so is your dad.

Okay.

We doing this or not?

I'm going in.

Mmm. Mmm.

What's up, bro?

What's up?

No.

Face smells like a dude's face.

Not for me.

Hmm.

All right.

Watch how a real man does it.

Hey, Winston?

'Sup?

Yeah.

I know, right?

Yeah.

Hmm.

Okay, well, then it's off.

Game over.

No. No way.

Winston?

Hmm?

All day!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Whoa!

I did it.

And I'm the one true Schmidt!

You got it, man. You can be Schmidt. I'm...

You should not do that on Thanksgiving.

I kissed a dude!

Oh, I miss Krista.

You know, she had a little mustache, too?

I know she did.

You okay... Schmidt?

Yes... I am...

Schmidt.

Happy Thanksgiving.

Give me a hug. I love you, sweetie.

Love you.

Love you, sweetheart.

Love you, Mom.

Love you, too, sweetheart.

Joan, I just want to say that I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.

Come here, Cece.

Give my little girl drugs again ... I will end you.

Bye.

Bye, everybody.

And no more parent traps.

Okay.

Yeah. We're done with those.

Got it.

Been there, trapped that.

Bye.

Love you guys. Bye.

I won't tell her if you don't.

Tell her about what?

Okay, gas, electric, and cable comes out to $219.34.

Jessica?

Do you have anything to contribute?

Here we go.

They're not all legal tenders, but they have value, like...

Sure.

That's $5.00.

$5.00.

Library card.

Library's not just for books any more.

Mm-hmm.

Library card.

Also, you can check out compact discs.

What else? This is a fortune.

Um, yeah.

"You are lucky and success."

How ironic.

That's going right to the gas company. "Paid in full."

Jess, we can't keep covering for you.

Yes. I understand.

It's just that, um...

recently I went through a, uh, life change where I was fired.

Maybe I can borrow the money from my good friend... Winston?

You know, I really wish I could, Jess, but, uh...

I'm a single man now, so basically I have to be able to trick women into thinking that I can buy them stuff.

Okay!

Here is my share...

to the penny.

Yeah! I'm not the poorest!

Second poorest. Now you're the poorest.

That's gotta be rock bottom.

Yeah, I got it.

You know what? I'm shutting off the gas until you can get me the money.

What?

What are you talking about?

Don't scapegoat me. I just gave you my money.

That's called tough love, all right?

No more handouts.

Now, what are you going to do about it?

How are you gonna pay the gas bill?

I don't know.

I've got an idea.

Get a job.

The school year's already started.

I have a lot of decisions to make as far as my rÃ©sumÃ©

is concerned.

I have to choose a font, spacing, columns...

Okay, just update your rÃ©sumÃ©, you ninny.

Did you call me a ninny?

Yeah, I called you a ninny,

'cause you're acting like a ninny, you ninny!

Don't call me a ninny, I'm PMSing!

Ah! Why would you... yucky! No, no, no.

I don't want to hear it.

It hurts.

I feel like I've laid a million eggs and they're all hatching.

I feel like I want to m*rder someone, and also I want soft pretzels.

You know what? I feel the same way.

Shut up! Shut up, you!

'Cause I don't want to hear it!

I've had it!

If any of you cross me, I'm gonna kick the testicles clean off your body!

Clean off! You'll look like Ken dolls down there.

Because that's where I'm at right now.

Now which one of you guys wants to tell me to get a job?

Hmm?

Who wants to look me in the face and tell me to get a job?

Whatever.

"Whatever?"

What does that mean, huh? Whatever.

It better mean,

"Whatever you say, Jess."

I don't think it's fair that women have an excuse once a month to act irrationally angry when the rest of us have to keep it together all the time.

You're irrationally angry

365 days a year, Nick.

What are you talking about?

I will push if I want to push!

Come on!

I hate doors!

Really? Well, that's just your personal opinion,

'cause I don't have anger issues.

You guys think I have anger issues?

Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it an issue.

An issue is something you can fix.

Been that way since I can remember.

This is some watered-down nonsense.

You're some no-good shysters!

On an unrelated note, I've just decided to take a walk.

Fine! Leave!

Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm gonna go get a job, like it's my...

Job? Shut up!

# Who's that girl? #

# Who's that girl? #

# It's Jess. #

Please don't do that, sir. Please.

I would love to sit by myself right now.

There's something real creepy about you, pal.

You want to get weird? Let's get weird.

You got a nice face.

Anger problem?

Living with them? Are you kidding me?

It's frustrating.

It's like... just get a job.

I like your hat.

I like how it's not a team or a logo, it's just blue.

Would you rather be covered in fish scales or feathers?

Scales?

Wow, you weirdo.

You want to see me jump really high?

Ha! Ah ha!

I'm afraid of dying, man.

Who am I?!

The enemy is en-e-my.

The enemy is the inner me.

Can you understand a word I'm saying?

You just nod at everything.

I need to change.

And you've showed me that.

I have an anger problem.

Thank you.

Can I get a hug?

I've got a story for you guys.

Ooh.

I met someone at work.

Emma Sharpe.

Divisional VP of all North America.

Wh-What are you doing in the break room?

This break room is in North America, isn't it?

Sure. That means I'm the Vice President of it.

I am the Vice President of everything in North America.

That sounds like... sexual harassment.

Robby, there's a fine line between sexual harassment and something awesome.

I thought you hated your co-workers.

You said they were a bunch of...

Pant-suited corporate She-Hulks?

Yeah, I know what I said.

Emma is the craziest woman to ever h*t on me.

Schmidt, you're such a nice guy.

Thank you. - What you deserve is a girl who respects you.

You know? A nice girl.

Mm-hmm.

I'm not into the nice thing, Robby. Doesn't do it for me.

Well, that's what I thought, too.

Yeah.

You know, until I found, uh... this one right here.

You mean Cece?

You think that I'm... nice?

No.

I think you're the nicest.

Mm.

Hmm.

Robby!

Yes, the man just left.

And he turned off the gas.

Yeah, I'm refusing to pay my gas bill as a matter of principle.

You'd like me to take the survey?

Of course I'll take the survey.

Schmidt?

Yeah, hold on.

Can I share some thing with you, man to man?

Oh, I'm...

You have to promise me you will not laugh.

Look, I'm... you're not talking to Nick, here.

You're talking to Schmidt.

Schmidt, I think I'm getting my period.

Okay.

This is a real thing, okay? I looked it up on the Internet.

It's called, uh,

"sympathy PMS," right?

Now, apparently this is an affliction that men suffer from all the time.

Right on.

I don't know how it happened, man, but somehow, I got on that woman's cycle of menstruation...

and I got that menstruation inside of me.

Winston!

Men can't get their periods.

Where would they put the tampon?

Hey! Are you calling me stupid?

You're the one that's stupid, okay?

You jack-faced butthole!

Who's the jack-faced butthole who turned off the hot water?!

Witch! What have you done to my body?

Shut up, you!

Why is there no hot water?!

Oh, I'm sorry, Jess.

If you don't pay, you don't play.

You also don't shower.

Are you serious?

Thank you, Denise.

Hey, hey!

Hey, great buddies.

Ow, my skin!

Okay.

Roommates... hey, buddy.

Don't poke me.

Something wonderful happened to me today, and I am no longer angry. It's gone.

Oh, shut up, Nick.

So let me get this straight:

Nothing at all's going to set you off?

That's right.

Nothing's gonna get to me,

'cause it's a new Nick Miller.

Awesome. Hey, Winston, tell him what you have.

Sympathy PMS. It's a real thing, I looked it up.

Sympathy PMS? What's that?

No!

PMS is mine!

Stop stealing my stuff, Winston.

You're telling me you're having a pre-menstrual something right now?

Yes.

Okay.

It's like a character in a Judy Blume novel.

No! You can't have my menzies.

He's got her menzies.

No part of this conversation is making me want to boil over with rage.

I feel really good, guys.

Hey, g*ng, why is the water so cold?

Schmidt turned off the hot water, because it's not enough that I have to go on an interview with the red devil in my belly, I also have to go unshowered.

there's no hot water in the whole house?

Yeah.

Seems strange.

Maybe a cold shower will wake you up to some harsh financial realities, Jessica Day.

You don't control my heat, Theodore P. Gasbag.

This is good!

We got a lot of feelings going around.

A lot of anger.

And you. You...

You're suddenly calm?

Yeah.

Really?

It feels like a fat man's sitting on my uterus.

I hear that.

Gonna go to the store!

Does anybody want anything?!

Thank you, Denise.

Hey, you wanted to see me?

Shut the door.

Whoa.

Quick reflexes. Good.

I am going to devour you.

You see that contract?

Oh, the thick one?

With all those tabbies?

Do me on it.

Pick that up.

Did you just ask me to pick it up to see me bend over?

No.

Oh, wait, I'm doing it.

Stand up.

What is this thing?

You're gonna have to sign it before anything can happen between us.

"Party A absolves Party B

"of any psychological trauma, whether temporary, permanent, future or imagined."

After we do what we do, you're gonna want to talk.

I can't allow that.

The less risk I incur, the more I can focus on creating a viable sexual experience for both of us.

You're gonna want to sign it.

"Possible exposure to lead paint."

Do I have a latex allergy?

That's very important.

"Guaranteed mercury poisoning"?

Mm.

Is this real?

You have till week's end to sign it.

What is your name?!

I can't keep thinking of you as my magical best friend with no name.

Joe. Tommy.

Louis. Tran.

Is it Tran?

What a crazy guess!

Beautiful name. Fits you perfectly.

My roommates are k*lling me.

Fine, you're right.

Okay, I like them, all right?

I hate myself. Is that what you want me to say?

Why do you always have to make everything so simple?!

How do you just get it?

How do I become you?

Show me the way, man. I'll do anything.

All right, man, I'm in.

You lead, my man.

All right, whatever is about to happen's gonna happen.

Jessica Day?

So why do you want to teach adults?

I think it's really inspiring that these people have chosen to go back to school, you know, that they want to read

To k*ll A Mockingbird,

that they want...

Oh!

I named my dog Boo after...

After Boo Radley?

Exactly.

That's amazing.

Oh, my God.

She was a puppy.

She's so cute.

I know.

Such a cutie.

This cup is so tiny.

So cute.

Sorry, how did she fit in the cup?

I just don't understand.

Just physically, how did she get so small?

I'm sorry, um... I'm sorry, I got this... I don't know what's wrong.

So weird.

Never happens to me.

She's really cute.

Yes, she was.

Did she die?

It's fine.

It's been two years.

Puppy... in a... cup.

So... we're both dog people, right?

Schmidt, am I nice?

No.

Thank you.

Nobody thinks I'm a nice girl, okay?

I'm the mistake.

Ah, Robby.

Midwestern heart, Midwestern body.

I'm the one who messes things up.

I agree with you.

I feel like he doesn't even know me.

You're getting your smell all over the comforter.

Oh, my God.

Took me months to get rid of that heavenly curry smell.

What happens when he realizes he was wrong about me the entire time?

He's just gonna run away.

I would, I would never run away from you.

But if I did, I would run way faster than Robby.

'Cause he's slow.

And I'm fast.

Maybe I'm just not meant for a functional relationship.

You know me, Schmidt.

You don't ever have to be nice around me.

I'm not scared of you.

I mean, I'm bad.

I do... I do bad things.

I don't think you're a nice girl.

Think you're the worst.


No.

No...?

No. I can't do this to Robby.

But you're a bad person. We discussed that.

You're a bad person, I'm a bad person. - Yep.

We can totally do this. No qualms.

I have a qualm. I have a qualm.

You don't have a qualm.

We sold our qualms, and we used the profits to buy perfect bodies.

Robby is right.

Hmm.

I'm nice.

I'm not nice, all right?

And I like Robby, but that is doing nothing right now from stopping me from wanting to kiss you.

Stop, stop, stop, stop.

But I-I don't want to stop.

I really don't.

I will never stop wanting to kiss you.

I am a monster.

I got to go.

Yeah, sure. Have fun.

Thank you. I really needed this.

Mm-hmm.

And I...

I'm a monster.

Okay.

What is this place?

What are you...?

What would you like?

What does this mean?

Let's not do this.

Let's not take off our clothes.

Let's go back to the park where it was good...

What do I know?

We're taking our pants off?

Okay. Keep those underwear on, am I right?

Yeah.

Stay on. Underwear good.

Why are you cradling me like a baby, friend?

This is not how guys of my generation hang out.

This is a moment that got away from me, man.

Oh, that's my butt.

This is intimate.

How did you know?

You are a huge baby.

Yeah, I am.

I am a huge baby.

Forget it, I'm done.

I'm not getting a teaching job.

Mm.

Just can't go back out there, you know?

Oh, I feel you, Jess.

I took a sick day.

I just stayed at home and did a watercolor of mountains.

So you gonna get this, like, every month?

I mean, it's a possibility from all the information that I've read on the Internet.

That women like you are the alpha.

What?

You're like the powerful moon, and all the women in your life are just latched on to your cycle.

In my case, grown-ass man.

Oh, yeah, good news.

The g*ng's all here.

Guys just PMS-ing?

Not in the mood today.

Don't really feel like being yelled at, so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and leave, because right now I'm feeling very fragile.

I understand.

What's wrong with you?

I'm no longer angry!

All the anger that used to be inside of me is gone!

It's gone, it's gone!

This is the worst thing I've ever seen.

What is wrong with you?

No.

Period's got you down?

That is such a raw deal.

Want me to get you a sanitary napkin?

Ew!

Okay, I won't get that.

But you're okay with pads or tampons or whatever it is that you're using?

Tell me about your day, please.

I want to get into your universe.

Let's rap it out. Go.

Floor is yours, pal.

Talk, talk, talk.

I want to listen.

No.

30 seconds of direct eye contact?

Stop it, Nick. Please, stop.

In three seconds, I'll be silent.

One, two...

I b*mb all my interviews.

What? What happened?

I was sabotaged by my baby box, which means I'm never gonna trust anything that comes out of it.

So that rules out a family.

I know just the thing you need.

Come with me.

Welcome to the wonderful world of water massage.

You are a piece of seaweed.

You are totally happy.

Ow!

I don't mean to touch your boobs!

You're touching my boobs!

I don't mean to touch your boobs!

Fail, fail, fail.

The next move is...

Oh, my...!

Relaxing is important. Relaxing is important.

Relax!

Oh, no.

What are you trying to do?!

k*ll me?!

It worked for me.

I was trying to help you.

I've been watching you doubt yourself for months.

I'm not doubting myself.

You're doubting yourself, Jess.

No, Nick, it's PMS.

It's not PMS.

You got knocked down.

It's time to get back up.

And get up long enough for one of these bozos to hire you.

I believe in you.

So does that guy.

Hey.

Think you can do that?

And if you don't, I'm gonna water massage you again.

Can you do that?

Yes.

Can you do that?

Yes!

Jessica Day?

Yes, I'm here.

Weren't you here the other day?

Weren't you here the other day?

Yes, I was.

Well, I signed it. Please note the added provision.

In any autobiographical account of my life, you want to be referred to as Moises Perdue.

Non-negotiable.

But you're fine with the rest of it?

Look, I'm a depraved freak, and I want to wander into your Narnia of sexual terror and emerge like a freshly birthed calf.

Put your hands out.

Let's do this.

Are you ready?

I'm ready. All right.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Interesting technique.

Hold tight.

I mean, I could totally get out of this.

What, have you never bound somebody before?

I got to start over.

This your first time?

Are you rejecting me?

No, I... no.

I mean...

Because legally... you can't.

Now take off your pants.

Okay.

Now.

All right, all right.

I got it. I got it.

Right there. Oh.

No, I got it.

Hold on, I got it.

I did it. I did it.

Ladies and gentlemen,

drumroll please.

Cut! Cut, Nick!

Snare drum.

I shouldn't have to specify.

Jess, that was a cymbal.

Cymbals are part of the drum kit.

Yeah.

Nevertheless, we are gathered here today to celebrate the reemployment of Jessica F. Day.

Not my middle initial.

Who will once again be in the classroom, molding the minds of children.

Actually, I'm gonna be remolding the minds of grown-ups,

'cause I'm gonna be teaching creative writing to adults.

So, what, are you gonna be, like, reading a bunch of weirdos' writing?

Well, I hope you like stories about vampires and bad childhoods.

I do.

You're gonna get them.

In any case, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are thrilled that you will once again have a reason to shower daily.

Yes.

Now, let there be gas.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Ah, yeah!

Gonna be hot water in six to ten minutes, fool! What?! - Yeah!

Schmidt! Schmidt!

Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

Where's Winston?

Where is Winston?

Go get Winston!

Where is he?

Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

Schmidt! Schmidt!

Come on, jump around with us.

Come jump with us, Winston.

Sleepy eyes.

Hey.

What's going on, man?

I don't really have PMS.

I know. You're a man.

I miss Shelby.

This is all about your breakup?

I know just the thing you need.

Oh, no.

Just relax and breathe.

I'll take your shoulders.

I'll take your feet.

This is really weird, man.

Really weird.

Cool vibe, man.

What are you guys doing now?

What have I gotten myself into?

Hey, lady, crushing that flute, babe.

And breathe.

Okay, I'm trying. I'm gonna do that.

Whoa. Just chill out.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing with my legs?

No! Come on! Come on, chill out!

Nick, what are you doing, man?!

Reset. Let's reset.

This is weird!

No! No! No!

Nick, where do you even buy sheets like this?

They're the thread count of a paper towel.

Okay, I don't know what to do.

I thought these sheets were good.

You said these sheets were fine.

They're fine. Relax.

He's freaking out.

You know, Amelia's coming in town...

Which one of your depressing ex-girlfriends is Amelia?

Freshman year.

* You stopped in my room *

* For no reason *

* I was pretty cool to say "Come in" *

* You're sitting on my bed *

* I feel like there's vibing *

* What do I do? *

* The sexual tension is crazy. *

I never told her how I felt.

And she's here for a couple days on work.

This is my chance.

I even got a new shirt.

That's a cool shirt;

I like that shirt.

Yeah, look cool, man.

You making fun of my shirt, Schmidt?

Oh, my God!

Jess, please stop working at the haunted house.

It's just through the weekend.

You all get free tickets, you know.

Oh, no, I'm not going.

I don't do haunted houses.

What? You scared?

Uh, well, Little kids are scared. I just don't like it.

I got it. You look like a zombie Woody Allen.

Yeah.

These brains are terrible.

And such-such small portions.

On Christmas, I like to eat Chinese people's brains.

They're the only ones that are open.

Zombie Cristina Barcelona.

Yeah, I have nothing to add to this.

I'm gonna be home late tonight, you guys.

Uh, so don't wait up, 'cause I'm going over to Sam's house to mix his batter.

Oh, yeah.

Not in that costume.

I don't know.

Costume kind of works for me.

Kind of a sexy, undead driver's ed teacher.

It's my sweet spot.

Sam doesn't care what I look like.

'Cause I'm not his girlfriend.

And I'm gonna kick him to the curb once I've used his body like a moisturizer sample.

Hey-yo!

I couldn't afford my therapist, so I ate his brains.

Marx brothers.

Hear, hear.

That's the one.

Good stuff.

* Who's that girl? *

*Who's that girl?*

* It's Jess. *

Hi.

Hi.

How you doing?

Good.

Oh, oh.

Oh.

Um, here's your wallet.

Oh, thank you.

You must have dropped it on our most recent trip to No Pants City.

Just so you know, I didn't look in it.

'Cause I don't care and I respect your privacy.

Then how'd you know it was my wallet?

Well played, Sam Sweeny...

Born in Boston, six-four.

I didn't know you worked in the E.R.

Until I got here, though.

Yeah, pediatrics.

You're a doctor for children.

It's, you know, mostly paperwork.

That why you have so many cute cards on the wall?

"Dear Dr. Sam..."

They call you Dr. Sam?

"Thank you for making me better.

I love you, and so does my bunny."

Nice kid, but she can't draw for crap.

I mean, she just traced Bugs Bunny.

I didn't know you were a, like, caring person.

Same guy. Same guy.

I'm the same guy that did you in that falafel restaurant, you remember?

And a dirty one, at that.

Mm-hmm.

Please don't do this.

Dr. Sam.

Don't start thinking I'm some amazing guy.

This is why I don't tell girls what I do.

This doesn't change the way I feel about you.

I feel nothing. This is purely physical.

Dr. Sam!

Oh, Ben! What's up?

Fish tails?

I, uh...

How could I say no, buddy?

Fish tail! Fish tail!

Up top!

This makes me feel nothing.

I feel nothing.

I haven't worn these in years.

Here you go.

Wow, Schmidt.

You've got so many boots.

You know who doesn't have a lot of boots?

Guys who aren't getting laid on the reg.

Ooh, trust me, I know. Shelby and I agreed Mm-hmm.

That we're gonna dress sexy this Halloween, so...

hopefully that'll make us want to have sex with each other.

You know, at night, I can actually feel gusts of frigid air coming from beneath your door.

I get it, Schmidt. We're in a rut.

Without sex, she's not your girlfriend, okay?

She's a friend that you buy meals for.

Winston, I get it, man.

You're... you're scared to end it.

You're just like Cece.

Cece's scared to end it with Robby, because clearly she's still nuts about me.

Robby's nice. Good guy, man.

He always has gum.

"Oh, Robby... he's such a nice guy."

I'll show you nice guy. Boom.

Punch him in his face.

Yeah, put you in a guillotine choke hold.

And then Robby's like, "Oh, my God!"

"I can't believe this. Young Abraham Lincoln is choking me out in his guillotine."

You're going as young Abe Lincoln for Halloween?

Statistically speaking, every American thinks about Abraham Lincoln at least once a day.

And Cece's American, so...

Thank you for that information, Schmidt.

Yeah.

What's up, Robby?

What's up, Robby, you stupid idiot?

You had an alter ego, remember?

Yeah.

The guy who'd been in a coma who woke up thinking he had invented pie.

Oh, I got a great new idea for a dessert!

Wait a second, what year is it?

That's awesome you liked that.

No, I'm really glad you're here.

Welcome to Los Angeles.

L.A., as the locals call it.

This is the city where many scenes from the film Beverly Hills Chihuahua were sh*t.

Yeah, it's pretty cool.

Mm-hmm.

I made you up a couch.

Wow.

The double eye patch.

You trying to impress me?

Yes!

Absolutely!

You kidding?

A doctor?

Mm-hmm.

I had him pegged for a part-time tennis pro or an unemployed handsome guy.

He cares about people for a living; it's so much hotter.

You're starting to like him now.

No, no, no, we're just coworkers.

On the night shift.

These fit great, Jess.

Really, thank you so much.

It's like a childhood dream come true for me.

To be a Ninja Turtle.

And to have a beautiful girlfriend, of course.

Uh-huh. Thank you.

What am I looking at here?

Robby, man to man, you didn't want to wear something, I don't know, a little more form flattering?

Maybe like a pile of towels, the number eight?

Schmidt.

I know. But how could I not knock down such low-hanging fruit?

Speaking of low-hanging fruit, Jess, you didn't want to let out the pants a little bit?

No.

Not even a touch?

No.

You want to look at your work?

Looks great.

Not to an eight-year-old child.

Who's just staring right down the barrel.

Enough.

Are you guys coming to the Halloween festivities tomorrow?

Actually, we're...

I think you should come.

It's for charity.

You like charity, Robby, right?

Yeah, sure. Like Cece dating you.

Awesome. Um...

Why not?

No. I mean, We have that thing...

Don't worry about my friends.

I would love to hang out with your friends.

I think we should do it, because I want to wear this costume out.

You know what I mean? So I say yes.

Just, uh, keep the pumpkins away from me, okay?

I kind of cut myself last Halloween.

I mean, not on a Kn*fe.

I-I, you know, I cut myself on the pumpkin.

You should've made a move in college.

No, I didn't have moves, Amelia.

My moves were Singing to you and trying to give you back rubs and...

I do remember you picking a lot of eyelashes off my cheeks.

Didn't you think it was weird that I kept showing up at your door, telling you I had a family tragedy?

How many grandparents did you think I had?

I had a bad bag of moves, lady.

Well, they're not bad any more, Nick Miller.

Ah, that's great.

That is for real.

There's more where that came from.

Uh-oh.

Oh, that's good stuff.

That is good.

Hey.

Sam's in there.

Yeah, Amelia's in there.

High five for sluts.

Yeah!

Hey.

I think I might like Sam.

Jess, I thought the whole thing was how you didn't like him.

I know, but then...

Hey.

Hi. You must be Amelia. I'm Jess.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Nick's told me a lot about you.

Yes, I did.

Yeah, it finally happened.

It's crazy... Nick and Amelia.

Together.

Together, yeah.

Together, yeah.

Together.

Really? Right now?

Okay.

Yeah, good.

Okay.

All right, call me tonight?

Actually, tonight's the last night of this haunted house thing.

Here's a crazy idea.

What if you came?

Well, I don't really do, uh, the, you know, sort of costume thing.

I'm gonna be dressed up.

I think you should dress up, too.

'Cause it'd be cool.

For me.

Okay. I'll try to make it, darling.

Well, I wish I hadn't have seen that.

You wish you hadn't seen that?

I wish I hadn't seen...

Fair point.

What if tonight's a test?

If he shows up wearing a costume, he likes me.

Sound logic.

I know.

Jess, I-I... Jess, I was kidding.

How do the boots feel, man?

Feel fantastic, man.

Well, there's more where that came from.

Got a lot of boots.

Whoo, looky here!

One of my brothers in blue.

That g*n looks real. Let me see that for a second.

LAPD! Stand down! Stand down!

I'm standing, I'm standing! Look at that!

Butch it up, Axel Foley.

Shelby's coming.

Yeah.

Hey.

Hey. What, uh...

What-what are you?

I'm reigning cats and dogs!

Get it?

Reigning...

cats and dogs.

Those stuffed animals are gonna look good on the floor of my bedroom.

Oh!

What are you doing?!

No, it's cool, it's cool.

Hey, guys.

Hey, Schmidt.

Hey, Robby.

Hey, look, I get it.

Guy who sh*t John Lennon dressed as a Ninja Turtle.

No.

Cece, you're an angel, as always.

Get off my horse, Schmidt.

Hey, Lincoln, right? That's awes...

You know, I was just thinking about Lincoln today.

Yeah, Robby, we all were.

This is kind of funny.

The two of you together on that horse, you kind of look like a bride and a groom.

I will throw you off of this horse with my bare hands. I will.

I'm gonna tell him how I feel tonight.

You are?

Think so.


Boo!

What'd you carve here?

Oh, it's a secret. I'm not done yet.

What's wrong with me?

I wanted this for so long with her, and now... it's just too much.

You know?

Mm-hmm.

You want to know why I don't like haunted houses?

Why?

Because they're just like relationships.

You walk in all confident, and then once you get in, it's not what you thought it was gonna be, and it's scary.

Nice, you've liked her for a long time.

Go in the "haunted house."

I'm gonna go in the "haunted house."

Ta-da! That's me, that's you, and that's our dog.

I look so scared.

Bride and groom?

No!

No, I'm here with the Ninja Turtle!

Bride and Ninja Turtle.

I don't get it.

I don't get it, either.

Like she lost a bet or something.

What is wrong with you?

Seriously!

It's okay, Cece.

No, it's not okay!

You need to go home and change, Schmidt.

I know you have more costumes in your closet.

Those costumes are for Purim. Purim's in March.

I don't care! You're doing this intentionally just to mess with me!

All right, calm down.

Everybody just... just calm down.

All right, Schmidt? Let's take a walk.

Let's take a walk.

Look, let's just cut the crap, okay?

I know you think I'm dumb, and you can h*t on Cece and make fun of me all day long, but I'm not going anywhere, all right?

You're a big guy, you know that?

Yeah.

Luckily, I've got a stone forehead.

What?

I'm sorry.

No, it's cool, man.

You just tried to head-butt me.

I had to stop you.

No, yeah, yeah.

I got you. I got you.

All right.

Damn it!

Schmidt, you did it again.

How do you see that coming every time?

You wind up. You make, like, a little wind-up thing.

I just...

h*t me right in the forehead.

Yeah, well, you tried to head-butt me with your forehead.

Yeah, I know I was trying to head-butt you.

Okay, listen.

I think there's two options here.

We can either go the way that things have been going and we're going to have a big problem, or we can just knock this off and let's be friends, okay?

I'm sorry.

Okay. I'm sorry, too.

I'm sorry, too.

My bad.

No, truce.

All right, truce.

Will you stop trying to head-butt me, man?

I just...

Look at this guy.

Looking great.

Oh, my God.

What?

He came.

He's not wearing a costume.

Yeah, but he came, so...

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, I got to sneeze.

I'm a clown for you.

Just don't ask me to wear this in bed.

Okay.

I think, when he comes here tonight, I'm just going to be like,

"Sam, crazy idea...

why don't we take this to another level?"

And pretend like I'm just thinking of it, but I'm not...

Can you hand me my coffee?

Yeah.

Zombie, just tell him the truth.

Mummy's right. Take the big swing.

It's okay to be vulnerable.

You guys are right.

Life as a doctor.

Your phone must just be bl*wing up with life-saving texts, huh?

"Don't die on me, Danny Boy! Use the paddles!"

No, it's a girl.

Oh, I thought Jess was working.

It's another girl. Just a weekend thing.

Does Jess know you're texting other girls?

Yeah. We're, like, totally honest with each other.

You know? I mean, she wants a relationship less than I do.

It's actually awesome.

Right.

And you're coming over tonight, hmm?

And she's going to talk to you.

Ooh.

All right, man.

You've got to be kidding me.

Just do it, Nick.

Don't be scared, Nick.

You're a grown man. This is a haunted house.

Game time.

I have no idea how they deep-fry a turkey dinner, but I am so glad they do because I love it.

Do you love your legs? Because, I'll tell you, diabetes doesn't.

Where have you been?

Oh, God, I'm sorry.

I totally lost track of time.

We decided that we're going to hang out more.

All of us are going to hang out more.

You know, 'cause I remember you saying that missed hanging out with Schmidt, so...

Oh, Robby.

You said that?

Yeah, I... yeah, I... I said it, but...

No, because I want to hang out with you, too.

With Robby there?

Yeah, with Robby there.

Good.

Good.

Oh, yeah, good, good.

Good.

Lincoln, bringing the nation back together again.

Jess!

Jess, where are you?

Watch your step!

It's just a recording.

Good, good. Fun.

Okay. It's not a race. It's not a...

Welcome to the morgue, Officer and...

Sorry. I have no idea what...

that whole thing... I don't...

I'm reigning cats and dogs.

What?

"Reigning" like a queen, But... but "raining"

like the weather.

No.

"It's raining cats and dogs!"

Right.

It's a joke.

Not really.

What?

Hmm? No, I'm saying, like, it's not really... not really funny.

It's hilarious.

I thought you were going to dress sexy.

A sense of humor is sexy.

I don't want to date the queen of Cats and Dogs.

Reigning cats and dogs.

Makes no sense.

I don't see the queen of England running around with a cape and British people stapled to it.

What?

When is the last time you heard somebody say,

"Man, you know what's sexy?

A woman with stuffed animals taped to her back."

Look how good I look! Look how stylish I look.

That's not sexy. I feel like I'm getting a speeding ticket.

Ooh! Shelby, you made me so mad, my mustache is coming off!

Why do you have a mustache glued on top of your mustache.

Why aren't we having sex?

Shut up, bitch.

Sorry.

Shelby, this is not working.

It's just not.

I know.

Oh, I get it.

Reigning cats and dogs.

It's funny. It is.

Jess.

Jessica Day, where are you?

No, no!

Very effective. Very scary.

Come in! Come in!

This is fun. This is entertaining.

Oh, no! Jess!

No! No!

Jess! No!

No, I'm her friend.

Somebody help me!

This is my nightmare!

I didn't punch a girl. I punched a horrifying monster.

You of all people should know this, Frankenstein.

You're the real monster.

Oh, give me a break.

Jess, are you okay?

Yeah. It's nothing.

Nick just punched me in the face.

What?!

Oh, my God! No, it was an acc...

What is wrong with you?

Jess, I'm sorry!

All right. Look away.

All right, well, the bruise is going to heal, but I don't know what to do about the giant stitches.

I mean, those are going to scar.

And you're looking a little pale.

What have you been eating?

Brains.

Habit.

I think we should go.

Sam. Uh, wait.

Um... um...

uh, I... I like you.

I like you, too, Jess.

No, but, um...

I care about you, and, um, I want to ask you out for real.

So... will you go out with me?

I can't.

I told you...

what I wanted, and I wasn't lying.

Yeah, um...

I just thought maybe you were scared to say it.

I'm not.

Not scared, you know.

This is how I feel.

Do you want me to go?

Hey.

Hey.

You punch a girl?

Yes, I did. Uh, I'm a coward.

I'm scared of haunted houses.

And I'm scared of you... I always have been.

That's right. That is what I've been trying to remember.

I was like, "Nick is great."

Why didn't I realize it years ago?"

And it's because you could not tell me how you felt.

So you always knew I liked you?

You drove me home every Thanksgiving break.

You lived in Chicago;

I lived in Florida.

Well, I was trying to avoid the tolls.

How do you feel about me now?

Great. Good.

I can't believe that after all this time, you still can't be honest with me.

I'm sorry, all right? It's my fault.

Okay, I fell in love with you the first time I saw you... that's crazy.

I didn't even know you. It was just this idea of you.

And then... it just wasn't what I thought.

And what's up with the way you kiss?

It's like reverse CPR. It's like you're...

Hey.

I'm not an idea of a person.

I'm an actual person.

Okay.

Ready? Uh-huh.

One, two, three.

All right, let's try it one more time. Let's see if we can h*t the top.

I think you guys deserve the couples costumes.

Bride and groom.

Aw.

How sweet of you.

Thank you.

Take the hat.

It's... that's, like, the most important part.

Very nice of you to do that, Schmidt.

Hold this.

Okay, I'm not... I don't need to wear a second costume.

This and the hat and the blazer's enough, so that's...

You need it, Robby.

Where you going with this here, buddy? I...

You're not going to... the pants, too?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

We're fine. We're good.

It's important, man. Need to wear the whole thing.

Just... what are you going to wear?

Plan B was always Matthew McConaughey in Magic Mike, so...

Always got to have a plan B, Robby.

Thanks, man.

Wow. I mean, look at his thighs.

They're like fleshy tree trunks.

Whoa.

I mean, he just knows how to work the crowd.

I mean, his thighs are, like, the size of my head.

Reigning cats and dogs!

Yeah!

Coat of arms.

You are so awesome!

You know, I may not actually be Abraham Lincoln, but I witnessed the emancipation of one black guy tonight...

from a terrible relationship.

Come on.

I know I said you shouldn't put yourself out there, but I'm glad you did.

You should be with somebody who's crazy about you, Jess.

Thanks, Nick.

That'd be really nice if it wasn't coming from somebody who just punched me in the face.

Sorry about that.

All right, you ready?

Mm-hmm.

Let's do it.

All right. Let's do it.

Okay.

Jess, let's make this right.

All right.

I can't do this.

I'm glad you're you,

'cause Jess Day could...

Ow! Mother of... Damn it!

# Happy birthday, dude! #

Hello.

I made you a cake.

Can't. Booked a car show for tomorrow, and I have been so good this week.

I lost four pounds.

Oh, come on, Cece.

It's your birthday. We're gonna eat cake, we're gonna watch Clueless on VHS, and we're gonna try to make prom dresses out of towels.

Obviously, just like we always do.

As if!

As if is, like, the funniest thing ever.

I wish I had a stepbrother to fall in love with.

I know, right? Paul Rudd.

You know, actually, I thought maybe this year, we could go out, you know?

We go party tonight.

Let dogs out. Catch gypsy.

Yeah. Yeah, Nadia wants me to go to this last-minute thing she found out about, so I thought we could all, you know, just go out tonight.

You, me, Nadia, the girls.

The models?

Yes, Jess, the models. Please?

You and I have never spent my birthday apart, ever.

Except for the one time in seventh grade where you walked out of my sleepover because you claimed...

When you struck me in the breast.

But I didn't even touch boob, because you know, we all knew you were stuffing...

Oh, my God.

We were all stuffing. Stuffing? We all stuffed.

You've seen my grandmother. I was not stuffing.

Yes, we were.

It was seventh grade.

I've been like this since I was seven.

You're...

Come out with us tonight!

Please, please, please!

Okay.

Okay.

I'll come.

Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

I so excited.

I shake this thing that my mama gave me.

YOLO!

# Who's that girl? #

#Who's that girl?#

# It's Jess. #

The Galapagos tortoise, or Galapagos giant tortoise, Unbelievable...

Is the largest living species of tortoise...

Spectacular.

Hey, do you think Jess would be mad if I got a turtle and named it Jess, even though I had that name picked out before she moved in?

A turtle?

Thinking man's best friend, Schmidty.

In our home? Over my turtle-disease-ridden d*ad body.

Whatever, dream k*ller. What's this?

Got you a cookie.

What, you have, like...?

Have, like, an extra?

No.

So you just, like, got me a cookie?

Yeah, I was thinking about you.

What do you mean you were thinking about me?

What do you mean? I don't know. I was thinking about you.

Think about you a lot, bro.

Why?

I don't know. Because you're my friend, you're on my mind.

What, do you not think about me?

Of course not!

Oh.

Schmidt got me a cookie.

Oh. Very nice.

What do you guys think?

Whoa! -

Smokin' hot.

I'm going out tonight with Cece and her model friends, and I'm going for "promising ballerina turned streetwalker."

You have too much joie de vivre.

Okay, you want to look a little bit more bored, tired.

Just altogether disengaged.

More tired... more, like, sick-like.

Really let your bones prop you up.

Did you put shoe polish on your eyes?

I never understand you women... God.

Eye shadow, man.

That's...?

Oh, that's makeup?

I would take that off.

That looks crazy.

Can't believe I have to deal with the models just to hang out with Cece.

Last time we hung out, it was awful.

I figure the best way to talk to models is just point to objects and describe them.

The table is round.

It's also flat.

Yes, the table is round, and it's flat.

Oh, look, a lamp.

I love Cece, and these are Cece's friends, so I should be able to get along with them.

I should be able to deal with the fact that they think I look like a monkey...

from a Russian cr*cker ad.

Whatever.

It's Cece's birthday. It's her special night.

I can get drunk, point at furniture if that means I can spend some quality time with my BFF.

Hey, is it totally obvious that I'm not wearing underwear?

# Because it should be. #

And that makes two of us.

Hey!

You made it!

Sorry I'm late.

They let in a lot of people ahead of me... like, a lot.

Saving the best for last.

Monkey cr*cker.

Monkey cr*cker.

Monkey, monkey, where you keep the crackers?

This is so much fun.

Schmidt?

So, it turns out there's more than one type of turtle.

I could go Eastern Box, or spur thighed, or nearsighted loner.

What was that? You just grunt at me?

Wasn't a grunt.

That was a grunt, Schmidt.

It was a "hurumph."

Hurumph.

I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way; it was not a grunt.

Serena Williams. That was a grunt.

It's all good, man, all right?

It's all "smoove in the groove."

Mellow, man.

Mega-mellow.

Okay.

Schmidt, what the hell are you doing?

You don't think about me?

What are you talking about?

Earlier today, when I gave you the cookie, I heard very clearly, "I don't think about you, Schmidt."

Why would I think about you?!

Because we're friends, we're not animals.

We're men, Schmidt! The only time a man is allowed to think about another man is when that man is Jay Cutler.

I don't know who Jay Cutler is!

Why are you saying

"Cutler" like that?

And I also don't know what is allowed in the Cold-Hearted Republic of Nick Miller, but I do know how I feel.

Ugh!

And I know how much you love cookies.

And I saw it there behind the glass, and I thought, "Nick Miller... I'm gonna buy him that."

If I could give you that cookie back, I would.

Nothing would make me happier than to throw it up, mash it into cookie-shape, and shove it down your throat!

You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?

No, that's not...

You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?

No.

You're not mama-birding anybody any cookie.

Schmidt, I don't want to mama-bird you a cookie.

What is your problem, Schmidt?

No mama-birding here!

Okay, I think I got it, okay...

# Monkey, monkey #

# Where you keep your cr*cker? #

# Monkey, monkey, you are comrade best! #

Whoo.

You know what?

The dance is surprisingly sexual for a children's cr*cker.

Do song again... "Dance Monkey."

I don't want to dance...

"Dance Monkey."

# Monkey, monkey #

# Where you keep your crackers? #

Dance monkey, dance monkey.

cr*cker, please!

Dance monkey.

cr*cker, please!

Monkey! Monkey!

No. You know what?

Monkey! Monkey!

Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

Monkey, monkey, monkey!

Dance Monkey... -

You know what?

No! Stop it!

I don't want to, okay? I'm done.

You guys are the worst!

You're the worst. I'm sorry, but it's true.

All these r*cist in-jokes about Romanians.

Well, guess what? I'm one-eighth Romanian!

Monkey, no! - And I don't know why Cece would want to spend her birthday here.

It's like years of modeling have made her dumber.

Nice, Jess.

No! Cece.

No, I'm sorry. I didn't...

It's official.

We got to turtle-proof this loft.

Schmidt cares about you so much, man, and you don't even think about him.

Are you being serious right now?

Are you really taking Schmidt's side on this?

I am, because I know how you are.

I just don't know why he would run away.

All I ever did was love him.

This rock is so round.

I'm gonna go put it in a jar.

And nothing has changed. Nothing has changed, Nick.

You think Schmidt is in the right, and I am in the wrong here?

You realize I say good night to you every night, and you never say good night back?

No.

What is the problem, Nick?

Do you not want me to have a good night?

I can't just go around saying good night to everyone, and buying people cookies.

I am not a titan of finance, sir.

Do you know, once a week he goes into your room and cleans it, and then returns everything the way he found it?

And I'm weird in this situation?

The dirty old T-shirts, which he washes.

I didn't ask for that... I like living in my filthy messes.

That's the point, man. You didn't have to ask.

Nobody buys people cookies for no reason.

You still don't get it, do you?

Nobody.

That wasn't a cookie, damn it! That was a...

What?

Man, that was a piece of his heart.

Now, if you don't mind, good... night.

I'm sorry, but in my defense, Nadia just spent an hour explaining to me how to drink vodka with my butt.

You just embarrassed me in front of my colleagues.

Are you kidding me? It's not like you work in the UN.

You judge me for being a model.

Yes, I do.

You always have.

It's your birthday, and you won't eat cake.

Cece, you're better than that; you really are.

I just... I just feel sorry for you sometimes.

You feel sorry for me?

You just h*t me in the boob.

It was an accident.

It was not an accident.

Fine. It wasn't.

Oh... my... God!

Ho, ho.

What? Huh?

Huh?

You want that?!

Go. Just go.

Ugh! Uh!

What you gonna do now, huh?

Just...

What?

What? What? What?

What?

What? What?

What?

You should go.

Thanks for a great birthday.

Cece?

You drink with mouth?

Tonight, I drink with mouth.

Well, guess who's not getting a turtle?

They were out of turtles.

I bought a tiny cowboy hat for nothing.

Schmidt's not talking to you right now.

We're still on this?

Schmidt is tired of doing things for you that go unnoticed.

lining your shoes up at the door...

Don't line my shoes up at the door any more.

...Recording your favorite TV shows...

I appreciate that.

...The turn-down service.

The turn-down service is weird And I never asked you to do that.

Well, I guess those chocolate mints Just disappeared on their own.

Oh, I thought we weren't talking.

We're not.

Then why do I hear words Coming out that stupid hole in your face?

I'm a human being, and I'm entitled to my emotions.

Are you crying?

No.

Are you seriously crying, Schmidt?

I'm not crying.

Rough night, you guys.

I forgot to take out my contacts.

I think they're fused to my eyeballs.

What's going on?

Did you guys watch p*rn together again?

Why do you keep doing that?

It's always awkward.

Oh, wow.

What the hell was that?

In March, I will have been living with Schmidt for ten years.

I know that because he sent me an e-mail asking how I want to celebrate our "tin anniversary."

How did you guys become friends?

Was it an accident?

Did you h*t him with your car and you became his reluctant caretaker?

He lived in my freshman dorm.

And one day, he was just there.

Hey, hey, whoa, man, what are you doing in here?

That's my ramen.

It's better this way.

Y-You add water to it, you weirdo.

It's not a dry treat, it's a soup.

Who are you?

Schmidt.

You freak me out, man.

This is cool. We got a good vibe going, man.

You're a super weird guy.

Hey, sit there while I throw things at you.

Body slam!

No!

Don't do this! No!

And then he was always there.

And the truth is, is, Schmidt loves me so much, and to be honest, Jess, it scares me.

I mean, I don't think I deserve all of Schmidt's love.

All I do is tease him.

I mean, of course you do.

That's all you can do.

Do you think I'm a bad friend?

No, no, I'm a bad friend.

I got mad at Cece for being a model.

It's a dumb thing to be.

We got in a boob fight.

Feels like I fell forward on a treadmill.

I'm just gonna say this... I find that arousing, and let's move on.

Just, she's smart, you know, and she's interesting and she could be doing anything else with her life or at least trying.

You know, the weird thing is, I was actually there when she got discovered.

You, take your glasses off.

Okay.

I can take my glasses off.


I guess I was always disappointed with her for calling that lady.

It's just, when I hear all the stuff about Cece's profession...

like, the dieting... it's crazy...

and the butt drinking and the...

Did you say

"butt drinking"?

Yeah.

You can't say "butt drinking"

And then not explain what it is.

Yeah.

It has two of my four favorite things.

I just feel like we have nothing in common, you know?

Yeah.

Do you ever wonder why we're friends with these people, Jess?

And, worse, if we met them now, you think we'd still be friends with them?

Maybe not.

I should go talk to her.

Well, Nick, I'm out of tears... plumb out.

All that's left is just yellowish goo.

That's right, Nick... goo.

That's a third of my life.

Cece.

Oh, hey, Nadia, sorry.

This Wilmer Valderrama.

Um, Nadia, that's not...

I mean... or what I thought he would look like in person.

Nice to meet you.

Big fan.

Where's Cece?

Cece drink too much.

She puke, puke, puke.

She puke, cry, puke, cry.

She's so weak.

You put on pajama, Wilmer Valderrama, top only.

Then, you make me salad, bitch.

Let's, let's get you into bed, okay?

I don't think we're doing any modeling today.

No, I have to go, Jess, I have to go.

It's my job, all right?

You know what, Cece?

I'm so sorry about last night.

I know that you're...

I know you're an intelligent person, and sometimes I just...

I just get mixed up, you know, And I think that you're like me.

Don't, don't worry, I'm here.

Just tell me where to stand and what we're selling.

I'm gonna give it everything I got.

I'm calling your agency.

This is totally unprofessional.

Don't call my agency.

Just tell me where to stand.

Up on the spinning platform.

Yeah, I can't do that.

Okay.

Please, no, seriously don't. I can't lose this job.

No.

Don't call the agency, okay?

I'll do it.

What?

I'm actually a model, too, mostly in Japan.

Um, they call me Giggle Bangs Rice Bowl.

I know you're lying and I just don't care.

Get over to hair and makeup now.

Cool.

These things are heavy.

It's like chain mail on my eyes.

So, your job is to highlight the features of the car Gary describes.

We need you to be fun and sexy and American.

Then he's gonna move to the EcoBoost engine and the new interior styling.

For the EcoBoost engine, give me something mischievous.

Mischievous.

Mischievous.

Show me mischievous.

Okay, and at the end, just say,

"Ford. Go further."

Do I have to wear those?

Hey, everybody, my name's Gary, and I want to introduce you to the all-new

2013 Ford Fusion.

Say hello to my good friend Jessica.

The all-new Fusion has been totally redesigned inside and out.

All-new styling,

18-inch aluminum wheels, three-year, bumper-to-bumper warranty, five-year power train, available Active Park, available lane-keeping system, standard voice-activated SYNC.

Your co-workers will be jealous.

From power plants that enhance efficiency the high-voltage lithium-ion battery pack provides enough power to operate in all-electric mode for short commutes... very smart.

The Ford Fusion is designed to be environmentally conscious.

Fusion Hybrid and the Fusion Energi are each powered by a combination high-voltage electric motor that utilizes... recycled material.

The Fusion is available with an EcoBoost engine...

a hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid.

The SE Hybrid is available with eco-friendly cloth seating.

No matter what color your seats... ha!... they'll be green.

Smoother rides, more fuel efficiency...

Gary...

The hybrid gets

47 miles to the gallon, so you're gonna be filling up your t*nk less.

Gary... Gary...!

When you do...

I can't get out.

Hey, man, it's your old pal Jessica.

And it's not that difficult to get out.

There's also the available auto start-stop That...

Use the handle.

What's happening?

Further, go further.

Hey.

Uh, Schmidt, I got you something, man.

Uh, they didn't have a Jewish star at the store, so I got you a regular cookie and I made the star myself by breaking off the pieces.

It's meant to celebrate your Jewish heritage.

What is this?

A Jewish star... I just said that.

Hey, hey, Schmidt, just...

This...

Is so terrible!

You gave me a cookie, I gave you a cookie.

You gave me a cookie, gave you cookie.

Gave me cookie, got you cookie!

You gave me cookie, I got you cookie, man!

Gave me cookie, got you cookie!

We're even! We're even, Schmidt!

I mean, what do you want from me?

What do you want, Schmidt?

I've been racking my brain all day.

I walked around the grocery store, man, for 45 minutes.

I didn't know what to get you.

And then I was thinking I was gonna get you ramen like we used to eat, but you probably eat, like, fancy ramen now with, like, figs in it.

I don't know, man.

You love me too much, Schmidt, and you picked the wrong guy.

And when are you gonna get that through that giant head of yours?

I'm just gonna let you down, man.

Are you crying?

I'm not crying, man.

Yeah, you are crying.

Oh, my God.

I'm not crying, guys. Just drop it.

I just felt like I did something nice.

Yes, you are, and that's okay.

Don't say that, man,

'cause that...

You know what I mean? Like...

Just let it rain, man.

I got you the cookie, Schmidt.

It's the best I can do, man.

What about the turtle?

You're the only turtle I want.

You're the turtle, man.

I knew I was the turtle.

Yeah, man, you're the turtle.

I knew I was the turtle.

You guys are the best, man. I love you guys.

I'm sorry, sorry, man.

Hey, yeah.

I'm going to, uh...

Yeah, I've got...

I'm gonna eat my sandwich.

This is a good sandwich.

See you guys.

This needed to happen.

Wow, they gave you the, the huge lashes.

Like, those are the magnums.

Yeah, I actually like 'em.

I think I'm just gonna keep 'em on.

You're afraid to take the glue off.

Yeah, I'm terrified.

I'm really sorry about what I said last night

'cause... this is hard.

It is just pointing at stuff, but it is... it's hard.

Why is it so hard?

You make it look a lot harder.

No, you're brave.

You've always been braver than me.

Okay, what did you do to me last night?

I mean, can you sprain someone's chest?

You should see the other guys.

Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?

I'm so full.

This really is your best cake ever.

Do you think so?

Mm-hmm.

We all think so.

Hey, that's gross.

Get a fork, man.

I got two Perfectly good forks at the end of my arms.

Hey, man, you do what you do.

Be you, man.

I'd eat out of your hands, Nick.

Cake on your face.

Petting zoo style.

Yeah, yeah.

Cake all day.

Talkin' about cake!

Frickin' cake dudes.

Look at you.

Look at you. Frosting face.

Hey.

Want cake on your face?

I don't really care.

Do you think, if we met today, we would still be friends?

I could watch you eat cake all day.

Couple of guys eating cake.

I'm gonna have to do so much cardio tomorrow.

I don't know, but we're friends now.

Happy birthday, Cece.

Oh, man! That's messy.

You like rap music?

Yeah, sure do.

Who's your favorite rapper?

Brian Austin Green.

He's cool.

He's awesome.

Go like this.

Try to catch the Pop-Tart, you big boy.

Good, I love Pop-Tarts.

Oh!

Now close your eyes.

Did you get me?

Yeah.

Good job.

Ready?

Ready?

Yeah.

Aah, we did it!

Hey, Mr. Belvedere, there's two guys outside with a giant box, and it's got "happy birthday" written all over it.

There it is.

Hey, guys.

Pay up, gentlemen. She's sitting on the couch.

Yeah, right, you won.

Let me get a four.

Mm-hmm.

TGIF marathon tonight.

What?

I can't take this any more.

What is happening?

I've actually been working on something.

A rÃ©sumÃ©, maybe?

Did I do that?

I'm sorry. Did you just say you were working on that?

It's Urkel!

Urkel?

Urkel.

Urkel, Jess?

It's funny.

Okay, look, It is perfectly fine to watch TV all day.

No, it is not.

No, it's not.

But Urkel?!

Come on.

Not even in my darkest moments did I do Urkel.

Guys, that's crazy. This is objectively hilarious.

I can do any character from an '80s sitcom. Quiz me. - No.

Oh, Alf, don't eat the cat!

Get out of the city, Cousin Larry Appleton.

I'm Frasier Crane.

No!

Jess, the men in suits here, the professionals, would like to know what the plan is.

I'm a professional, too, pal.

You're not. Please, you work in a bar.

It's a whole different thing. I respect you. Just, please.

I don't know what the plan is, Schmidt, but I love working at the Casserole Shanty.

Today I got a locker, and in 18 months, I'm gonna roll into some sweet dental coverage.

So, yeah, my job pretty much rules.

Low on bean! Low on bean!

I'm low on bean!

I'm good on bean!

Would you like to know what I did at my job all day today?

Don't say "crushed it."

I'm gonna go with "crushed it."

Funny enough, uh, I crushed it.

I crushed it all day today, and then I crushed it some more.

And then it asked me what I was doing, and I told it that I was crushing it.

That's what I do on a daily basis, Jess.

You used to inspire me.

I mean, not specifically...

because I find teaching to be icky... but, you know, in a vague kind of

"Look at that go-getter in a...

in a brightly colored sweater"

kind of way.

What happened to the inspiring, visor-less Jess?

Hey, maybe that's her.

Hey, we just moved in across the hall.

I'm Chaz.

This is Fife, Sutton and Brorie.

What's up? Schmidt.

Any-turds, just wanted to give you a heads up that we're having some people over to hang tonight and it might get a little loud.

I like where your head is at.

We're gonna be there with bells on.

Dolla-dolla bells, y'all.

Well, it's just going to be a bunch of young people.

So...

Hi. I live here, too.

What are you names? Schmidt!

* Who's that girl? * - *Who's that girl?*

* It's Jess. *

So, when he said,

"It's just going to be a bunch of young people,"

well, he must have meant, "You,"

meaning me, fellow young person,

"You'll feel right at home.

And you two walking corpses, stay away."

You're six months younger than me, Schmidt.

You're a corpse for sure.

Behold.

This actuarial table stops at age 99.

But if you track my current trajectory, I'm clearly gonna live till I'm 123 years old, so...

Hello, robot sex.

Is this accurate?

No, no, no, Winston, I spend $49.95 a month on a subscription to an inaccurate real-time actuarial service.

Then I think I may have d*ed four years ago.

Oh, yeah? That sucks.

"African-American male, life expectancy: 67 years"?

Sounds about right.

"Minus one year if you frequently question your career choice."

Check.

"Minus one year if your chosen field offers few opportunities for advancement."

Check and double check.

I like getting older.

I feel like I'm finally aging into my personality.

Keep this crap out of my yard!

And turn that nonsense down!

They never did get that Frisbee back.

I used that Frisbee as a dish. Seriously?

I used it for pistachios in my room.

Not only am I the youngest person in this loft, I'm also the most successful.

Oh! Shut up, Schmidt.

Are you honestly measuring yourself like a little boy?

I'm sorry that you're not growing any more like me.

And apparently, I'm gonna be growing forever.

I'm like a Jewish Peter Pan. Petya Pan.

Petter Pan. Pesach Pan.

Why don't you take it down a notch before this old man takes you outside and makes you pick a switch?

I'm like Snow Leopard. You guys are like DOS.

And as your elder, Can I give you a little advice, Schmidt? Can we talk for a sec? - Sure.

Yes, yes.

'Cause you've kind of gotten under my skin A little bit.

sh**t, Gran Torino.

I'm gonna die so soon.

Do you think that the neighbors will want, like, four individual casseroles or, like, one large party-size casserole?

Yes, Jess, that's exactly what hip, trendy millennials want to eat: casserole.

Now come on, guys, just tighten up, all right?

Think young. What the hell is that smell?

It's Old Spice.

I'm smelling Old Spice?

Yeah, and yes, It has "Old" in the title, and yes, it's all over my body.

Okay, well, take it off.

I'm wearing the Spice. The Spice is cool.

It's not even a real spice, man. Take it off.

The Spice is coming back! Everybody knows it!

The guy on the horse!

You can wear any spice. Don't wear Old Spice!

Classic cologne fight.

Guys!

Shh!

Hi.

Zander and Raj went to Pate's thing, so tonight's been notched down to a "chill hang."

Cool.

I'll just put these...

Oh.

Thanks for having us.

No, can't do this.

What is up?

Have fun, kids.

Party hip-hop. What's going on, kids?

Let's party.

What are you guys doing, huh? What is that?

Is that Top g*n? Oh, look at that.

Look at Anthony Eds, the "Goose" man.

Unbelievable that he dies in a few scenes.

Goose dies?

Not cool, man.

No, it's... Look, nobody does an onscreen death like Anthony Eds.

He's like the Hilary Swank of bald men.

He's like the Hilary Swank of bald...

Hold everything.

Is that Cass Shant?

Casserole Shanty? That's where I work.

Your chicken-broccoli totally fuels my night bikes.

I'm very happy to help.

Some of my friends don't appreciate it.

No.

You're just figuring it out, just like us.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I am figuring it out.

Thank you, Brorie. I am.

I'm just figuring it out, and that's okay.

What do you guys do?

I work at home. - I'm a DJ.

Well...

Was I unclear about my night bikes?

I work for a single-national corporation called Associated Strategies.

Moo...

Oh, moo...

I know. Yeah.

Totally, Fife. I get that.

Moo...

Moo...!

Right? That's a thing, right?

Yeah? Moo?

Schmidt, you don't know...

Jess.

Did I do that?

How did you just come up with that?

Where did you get that?

It just came to me.

Where did that come from?

I just thought of it.

That's how she casseroles!

What?

Hey, Nana, Pop-Pop.

You missed an unreal hang last night.

Unreal with a capital "uh."

Really?

Those kids with the found furniture and no TV because it's cool?

It's a different world over there.

A world where it's okay to only have a part-time job.

A world where it's okay that I'm still finding myself.

A world where I have not one, but two catchphrases.

$500.

How rude!

How rude!

Just take it!

They think I made those up.

There's just one tiny hitch.

It's very awkward, and I don't know how to say it...

They hate Schmidt.

So much. How did you know?

If I had a dollar for everybody I couldn't hang out with because they hated Schmidt, I'd be rich.

Like, fill my gas t*nk all the way up rich.

He was all over the map.

He spent 20 minutes talking about aioli.

Don't worry about it. I'm on it.

What do you mean, you're on it?

You're gonna prank him, aren't you? I-I knew it!

I knew it! You're gonna prank him.

Hey, can I help you? I'm really good with pranks?

You may not help with the pranks.

Why not, man? I'm the best with the pranks, man.

They call me "Prank Sinatra."

No, you call you Prank Sinatra.

Oh, come... 'Cause I am.

Winston, you're the worst at pranks in the whole world.

No, I'm not.

Yes, you are!

You either go way too small...

Hey.

Let's pour a little juice near her shoe.

...Or you go way too big.

Hey, let's h*t her in the throat with a ski.

You don't have a pranking sweet spot.

Speaking of...

Are you limping?

My hip is achy.

I wonder if it's your shoes. Did you try different shoes?

I try on four different pairs of shoes with every outfit, rain or shine. You know that.

What did you do?

Well, he could try on

100 different pairs.

It's not going to matter.

The left heel is an eighth of an inch shorter on every single pair.

This is so crazy, Nick.

Oh, my God, you know what we should do?

We should take those shavings, and then sprinkle them by his car.

Let me just get this clear.

Take the little bit of dust Yeah, 'cause...

And go outside and put it near his car?

Yes.

That's not a prank.

Yes, it is.

That's just kind of littering.

His whole ride to work, Okay, you're done.

He'd be thinking, like, "What?"

So we're pranking him so he thinks while we're not around, "What?"

It's too small.

You've got to go bigger than that.

Well, anyway, I got to fill this up with pee.

Ew! Why?

So I can pour it all over Schmidt's bed and make him think he's incontinent.

That's disgusting, Nick.

Hey, sometimes up close, art is ugly.

I got an idea.

Instead of urine, we use acid.

And put it on his face!

All right?


Jess, do these pants seem long to you?

Nick picked them up from the dry cleaner for me today, and I don't know, I swear they seem longer.

I think your pants look fine.

Okay, Jess, tonight, you're obviously gonna want to follow my lead.

I don't know how to tell you this...

Um, they hate you.

That's crazy.

It is crazy... how much they hate you.

Watch. Every time you say something, they're gonna change the subject immediately.

That's how you tell if people hate you.

I'm pretty sure I know how to crush it with the kids.

Watch this.

Hey, guys.

What up, yo?

Throw your damn hands up. We hanging out tonight?

Jess, I love your hair.

It is so good today.

Yeah!

Thank you!

Flowy. - Yes.

Really curly.

What do you guys think about the length of my sideburns? It's new. Daring or gauche?

I got my plane ticket home for Easter.

Thank you for reminding me, Jess.

Yeah. No, of course.

I've got, like, a little calendar thing.

You know, I've got a great, um...

I've got a great plane ticket guy that you...

We're having another hang tonight Jess.

Got some chokes, hula hoops, sitar. You should come over.

Yeah!

Yeah, no, like, that's the best idea.

Totally.

You, too, Schmidt.

Oh, hey, I got to... I got to take this.

Ferguson? Is that you?

Yeah, t-tonight?

Well, I mean...

I made plans with...

Well, look, if that's the comptroller's time line, then...

that's the comptroller's time line.

Well, hell, yes, send a car!

Jess, do you want to hula-hoop with me all night-slash-forever?

Oh, gosh.

They hate me.

Man, I've never seen you work this hard at anything, ever.

That's because I care so much.

I set an alarm for 5:00 a.m.

so I could switch Schmidt's fiber pills with placebos.

Damn it, I want to care about something as much as you care about ruining Schmidt's life.

And where have you been all night, young lady?

Jumping around to your hippity-hop?

Taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick?

I'm actually asking... I'm not doing a thing right here.

Those guys are so much fun.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been up for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa.

No, there's no time for sleep! Guys, here's what we got to do.

We got to find the passion that we have in life, and we got to hold on to it.

You're so right.

Just like...

I can't believe I'm saying this...

just like Nick Miller.

Why, look at that.

I've never been an inspiration before.

I don't like it.

It's too much responsibility.

Ooh, ay-ay-ay.

I am cons-to-the-pizzo.

Hmm?

Constipated.

I'm constipated.

Surprising.

Here, sit down, relax, watch some TV.

What's the chair doing over here?

Just moved it.

Oh... gosh.

Turn it down, man! Turn it down!

Turn it... What?

It's too loud!

Schmidt, you're blasting the TV, you maniac!

You can hear that?

It's blasting, Schmidt! Jess is trying to sleep!

You can hear this?

Uh, yes.

Well, you know what, you were right.

They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too.

It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity, a pan-ethnic, pan-sexual hive mind, and they want nothing to do with me.

They're not that great, Schmidt.

Last night, Chaz and Sutton got in a fight.

A lovers' quarrel?

Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.

Chaz is with Fife;

Brorie's with, uh...

the other broad.

Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater.

They're poly-amorous? Damn it!

Jess, you've got to help me help them forget how old I am.

You're not old.

Then how do you explain this?

Use your legs, buddy.

Let me show you something.

Gonna hurt your back.

Look at this... I'm freaking shrinking!

I took a photo of the wall, shrunk it down, made a copy at an architect's office.

From there, it was just your basic spackle-and-silkscreen job.

I don't care, but... yay.

It's a weird life, but it's where I'm at right now.

Okay.

Jess...

this is the hardest thing I've ever had to say.

Please help me be cool.

Say that one more time.

Oh. Visor-wearing Jess, will you please help me be cool?

Okay, listen up, I got 3.5 years to live.

I can't be an assistant any more.

I don't want to die. I want to work.

Honestly, I want to work here.

But I got to follow my passion, much like a running back would want when given the ball, and in the game of life, this job is the pigskin.

And damn it, I'm in the red zone!

And in summation, I feel...

very good about what I just said.

Hopefully, you do, too.

Who wants to start an arcade f*re?

Schmidt.

What?

What are you doing? This is not the outfit we talked about.

What? Rock and roll.

You way overshot it.

Look at that. I'm being ironic.

That's not ironic;

That's just a bad pun.

And what are you doing here?

Your arms are hot, but your neck is cold?

Hey, look at me.

If you guys keep a tight core, you can... your burpees can look like this, too.

When's the Olympics? Right, guys?

I'm gonna set a PR tonight.

Well, you know, he's not... he's not...

Parkour.

Oh!

Oh!

You got beer on her, man.

Did I do that?

Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here.

Sorry. Your mom does your laundry?

Washer-dryer kind of freaks me out, you know?

It's just, like, eh...

washa-washa-washa, guh-guh, guh-guh, uh-guh-guh-guh.

On the noise.

Okay, you know what? It's fine.

I'll-I'll wash it myself.

All right.

Thank you, though.

She's so iconoclastic and modern.

And she even got our dishwasher to work.

I remember.

You know, I mean, I just... it wasn't that big a deal.

It was just... I just... I just turned it on.

There was a button that said "on."

It's weird how the dishwasher just lives under the counter.

How come there's no dish-dryer?

Or un-washer.

Oh, my God, you guys, are we the dish un-washers?

Why don't we just move to Prague?

I need to focus on my art.

You can totally focus on your art in Prague.

If we move to Prague, should I paint my nails black again?

Hey, you guys, um...

I can't hang out with you any more.

Why not?

Because...

Our entire relationship's built on a lie.

Jess, what are you talking about?

I did not make up...

"Did I do that?"

Jess, please don't...

I have to introduce you to a...

Don't do it.

Little, adorable African-American nerd.

Don't press the button. Don't...

Jess, why would you do this to us?

Who's "Steve Urclee"?

Jess, what the hell was that?

You were supposed to teach me how to be cool.

You did a terrible job. Look what I'm wearing.

You didn't listen to anything I said!

I told you to stop trying so hard.

I will never stop trying.

I don't care if I have to do a billion burpees.

That is how you crush... you never give up.

That is the difference between me and you, Jess.

Is that what you think? You think I just gave up?

Well...

I was fired, Schmidt.

Do you think I wanted to stop teaching?

That's why I liked hanging out with those kids...

'cause they weren't judging me all the time for not crushing it.

Okay...

Do you think that I want to work At the Casserole Shanty?

Do you know what the people I work with call it?

The Ass-erole Shanty.

Just don't stop teaching.

I mean, there's got to be something.

I don't know, driver's ed, CPR...

Uh...

A smile class.

My life sucks so much right now.

But at least I'm not 23.

At least I own a trash can.

At least I can legally rent a car.

At least I don't live in a loft with three other...

But you live with us.

But I live you with guys.

Jess?

We don't care if you stole your catchphrase from some low-budget Web series.

We still want to hang out.

Don't trust your government, kids.

Oh, my God, it's the old man from the stairs.

I thought he d*ed.

Let's get out of here before his robe opens.

He's gonna get his old on you! Get out while you can!

Hey, hey, Charles, The decrepit thing that just walked by, now, that is old, okay?

And you can hate him for being old, but you cannot hate me.

We don't hate you for being old.

We hate you 'cause you're a viciously unbearable ass-head.

Seriously?

That's... Come here, that's...

Get off! Ass-head!

Ass-head! Yeah!

I'm not gonna drink it all.

Guys, I... am an ass-head.

They don't hate me because I'm old.

They hate me because of my personality.

I can totally change my personality.

Congratulations, Schmidt, that is... that's weird news.

Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at a brand-new man.

A man who has proved so capable of talking about so little for so long...

is now the producer of his very own sports talk show.

No way!

What?!

That's right. That's right.

Yeah, baby!

It's halftime in America!

Man, that's amazing!

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2:35 to 5:35 a.m.

Boom! Prime time for truckers!

That's awesome. He's got something.

Yes.

In other news, I just spent three days trying to impress people who don't own bed frames.

Well, if it makes you feel any better, I spent the last three days pouring urine on a grown man's sheets.

Can you imagine how much we would get done if we just focused our energy onto something a little bit more worthwhile?

Not to mention the money we would save.

I know.

Wait, what money?

I mean, I've been running the numbers on this, but, you know, I think I spent...

you know,

$1,200 to $1,300.

What?!

on these pranks, yeah.

What?!

And I was under- budget, so...

Under-budget?

What, you think fake contact lenses are free?

They are not, sister.

Nick, you don't have that kind of money.

I know I don't.

Where are you gonna get that from?

Doesn't matter. I had to prank Schmidt.

And I did.

Holy crap.

I need a real job.

Yeah, you do.

Don't you ever prank me!

Of course. You got it.

You'll never see it coming.

This is like the end of a horror movie.

Or the beginning of a pranking movie.

There are no pranking movies.

Yet. Get out of here.

You'll never see it coming.

This prescription is blurry.

Hi, Schmidt.

Is that you in tailored, grown-up clothing?

Yeah. Mama's gonna ride this blazer all the way to a tutoring job.

Thank goodness.

I almost thought I was gonna have to loan you money.

Well, I said tutoring job, not venture capitalist.

Proud of you nonetheless.

Thanks.

What the hell?

Okay. All right, Nick, very funny.

Quite the prankster you are.

Ha!

I'm gonna h*t your ass with a ski!

Winston?

Get some.

Hey.

You're a big girl. You can watch The Walking d*ad alone.

Sam booty-called me.

Ooh, Sam, he's so hot.

I don't care. Good night.

Don't!

What?

I need your help.

I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at casual sex.

I left him in there with crayons and paper, like he's a kid in a restaurant, and I told him I had to check my fantasy football.

You don't even know what that is.

No, sir, I do not know what that is.

I panicked. Help me.

Look, you can't separate your feelings from sex?

So what? You're a girl.

I deserve to have a shorty on the side.

Okay, a shorty is not... that's the wrong use of "shorty."

Hey, I drew a cat.

Sorry, man.

She's, uh, checking her fantasy football 'cause she...

Yeah, I'm not gonna do this, so I-I don't even...

? Who's that girl? ?

?Who's that girl? ?

? It's Jess. ?

Are we gonna talk about it?

Talk about what, Winston?

The belt, Schmidt. Please explain the belt.

It's after Labor Day. I'm wearing whales.

The dumbest thing ever.

You look like the bad guy in an '80s high school movie.

I'll have you guys know that Kanye wore this belt, okay?

Let me just say that word one more time: Kanye.

Kanye?

Yeah, and he looked beautiful in it.

His whole midsection lit up.

What is your obsession with Kanye?

Befriending Kanye is the most efficient way for me to jump social strata.

Now all I have to do is meet him, and then dazzle him to the point that we're each other's last call before bed.

"Yo, what up, K?

"Yeah, I'm just going to sleep.

"You watching Fallon?

"That brother's crazy."

Hey, Tagg Romney.

You know if your dad's gonna win the election?

: He does look like a Romney.

Telling me that I look like one of the most handsome men in politics does not hurt my feelings, Winston.

Last night was horrible.

Sam came over, we tried to make out, I stopped it, and then we just laid there like two old couple in The Notebook waiting to die.

Jess, I get it... you're the type of person that...

you need to ease into these kind of things.

Let us take you out tonight, okay?

And that way, you... you can feel like, you know, you're going on a date first.

Yes! Like we're all dating in a large, nonsexual friend group.

My nightmare. Have fun. I'm out.

Come on, Nick. Please?

Why are you doing this, Jess?

Why don't you just date a guy that...

I don't know... you like?

This is good for me.

I always jump into relationships.

Plus, Sam's not the kind of guy you spend Saturdays in your sweatpants with.

He's the kind of guy...

You bone.

I can't help. I'm at a crucial point in my zombie novel.

You selfish bastard.

I'm not a selfish bastard.

I just have to... I have to get through...

You're a selfish bastard.

I'm so sick of this zombie novel nonsense.

Not nonsense.

Friends help friends have meaningless sex, okay?

Now, you're going.

End of story.

You got it.

Where are you, Schmidt? This place is fancy, and I don't know which fork to k*ll myself with.

I got to bail! Kanye's at this club tonight.

What are you talking about? This was your idea.

Can't miss this, Nick. I got the belt on.

I took Winston with me to prove that I can be friends with black people, even oddly shaped ones.

Just shut up, Schmidt!

Shut up! This is ridiculous.

I'm leaving right now. Good-bye.

Whoa.

Wow. I forgot what you look like when you're not dressed like the Loft Troll.

Pardon?

Sorry, I didn't...

What I mean to say is you look va-va-va-vavooms!

Hello, nurse!

Hubba-bubba! Meow! Zing! You can stop me at any time.

Are the guys coming, or...?

No.

It's just us... they bailed... so if you want to go back to the loft, or we can both go back to the loft.

We're already here.

But we're already here, so...

Can I get you a chair, milady?

So weird.

Yeah.

Loft Troll not used to fancy gentleman!

Shut up.

That was so loud.

Why are you yelling?

On the list.

Winston! You've been staring at this girl for five minutes.

I hope you're checking her out.

Otherwise, you're a serial k*ller, which would explain a lot.

No. Checking her out?

No, dude, I'm in a relationship.

I know.

Like, happily. Shelby, we're...

Shelby and I haven't had sex in three weeks.

For real?

We're in a bit of a rut.

Not now. I have to go to the bathroom.

I'm cheating on Shelby.

What?

No, no, in my mind.

In your mind...?

I'm cheating on Shelby in my mind, man.

So what? So what?

What do you mean, "So what?"

I'm doing it all the time.

Like, I'm doing it a lot. I can't control myself, man.

Listen, everybody does it every minute all the time.

How do you think I get through the day, man?

Okay. Wow.

Um, in that case...

Hey, lady, can I introduce you to...

this lady?

This place is crazy expensive.

Schmidt picked it.

I can afford the valet charge and the "Add onions."

Then you'll be happy to meet my little Scottish friend.

You unexpected genius.

Is that whiskey?

White wine.

White wine?!

Why would you do wine?

Nope.

All right, my man.

Not gonna happen.

Schmidt?

It's the belt, man.

Take off the belt.

Okay, the only thing I know in this world is this belt is amazing.

Look, if you're gonna wear that thing, just...

just make it work for us, okay?

You got a plan?

Yeah, I got a plan, of course.

All right, go talk to your peeps.

It's not my peeps.

It's your peeps, man. Go talk to them.

Don't say... don't do this.

Yeah, man, come on.

I mean, come on. Really?

Yeah, word.

We got Tagg Romney out here.

We're gonna need you to sweep the the perimeter.

What the hell you talking about?

Tagg Romney. Pleasure to meet you, sir.

Romney. Like, Mitt Romney's your dad?

Let's get America back to work.

Here's the thermos.

Thanks.

You know, the drunker you get, the more obvious you're being with the thermos.

"Thermose?" "Thermas?"

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

What's a "thermoos?"

That one right there in your hand.

The "thermase?"

This is fun.

This is really fun.

It's Sam.

He's done with work, and he wants to "hang out."

He's got a job, too? Poke a hole in that condom.

Thank you, Nick.

I now feel ready to have meaningless sex.

I do what I can, so...

Hey, do you need money for the...?

Half the soup? No, I think I got it.

Loft Troll eats fancy soup.

Get out of here, would you?

Go have fun.

Excuse me.

Can I get an ice bucket for this bad boy?

And more than your normal amount

'cause this is a thermos, so...

I see what we're doing here.

We're stalking your ex-girlfriend.

Is Cece here?

Schmidt.

Cece, what up?

So, where's, uh, Blobby?

Where's... where's Blobby? Where's that dude?

You mean my boyfriend? His name's Robby.

Excuse me. My friend is too embarrassed to come over here, but she said she heard from someone in line that you're a Romney.

I am...

She's right over there.

Yeah, I'm a Romney.

Hell, yeah, I'm a Romney.

Come on!

Security, remove the thr*at. Remove the thr*at. Code red.

Is that how bad it is?

Right this way, ma'am. Come on!

Hey, that woman is stupid enough to believe...

Remove the obstruction, please. Code red. Code red.

Winston, I thought you were better than this.

I'm so sorry.

I am a huge supporter.

In '08, I was the national cochair of Kappas for Romney.

You caught me. I'm a Romney.

I'm trying to be incognito, so just...

You're... Tagg?

Tugg.

Tugg?

Tugg Romney, yeah.

I'm Tugg Romney.

Tagg's everywhere. Too much Tagg for me.

Tugg.

Whoo! What a night.

What a crazy night.

Yeah, me, too. I found a dollar on my way out of the restaurant. I used it to buy a slice of pizza.

One day closer to death!

Winston, what is wrong with you?

No. Nothing wrong with me, girl. I'm just brushing my hair.

I just want to say that I had meaningless, wonderful sex last night with Sam.

And that sex would not have been possible without the efforts of a one Nick Miller.

But okay.

I don't want to kiss and tell, but he did ruin my dresser during intercourse.

Come on! Why are you saying that?

Will you go to Ikea with me?

Sure, I'm not doing anything.

But don't let me lay my eyes on the Malm collection.

I can't afford it, and I'm a sucker for it every time.

I'll go get my golf pencils.

Mm-hmm.

If you got something to say, my man, just say it.

Hey, look, a man can only sit back and observe but for so long before he has to speak his mind.

Then speak your mind.

A line has been crossed, all right?

You, my friend, have become her fluffer.

Like in p*rn?

An emotional fluffer.

I'm an emotional fluffer?

You got to set some boundaries, all right?

You're gonna start fulfilling ever single need of hers, all right?

Doing all the things that a boyfriend would do...

Winston...for some other dude who ain't doing nothing.

And I'm her friend.

You're her boyfriend.

No, I'm not her boyfriend.

You're a boyfriend without the rewards.

How about this? Why don't you just shut up?

Hey, Nick, you ready?

Yeah.

So it's not available at the closest Ikea, but it is available at the second-closest Ikea, which is about 45 minutes...

if we could drive over the reservoir.

But we can't, so...

it's about an hour and a half.

Cool.

I had so much sex last night.

Fluffer.

You're gonna get caught.

Impossible.

I've been studying Romney trivia all day long.

Memorizing Dad's gestures so I can mimic him.

You're calling Mitt Romney "Dad"

now? That's where we're at?

Mm-hmm.

Schmidt, we get it.

He's the dad you never had.

Okay, all-knowing Indian god Ganesha, this is about sex.

You know they have Romney Olympics every summer at the lake house?

I bet that's a hoot. I'm sure it's like the real Olympics, only the white people win the sprints.

Okay, so you good?

Okay.

Yeah.

Hey, Nick, any chance you understand how to put this together?

I think it looks pretty easy, actually.

No, you know, I'm actually busy. I'm, uh...

I'm moving money around.

I'm-I'm diversifying. I've got...

And I'm not your fluffer, by the way.

What's a fluffer?

In p*rn, it's the person who keeps the actor...

motivated, aroused, you know?

Ew! That's a job?

And that's what I am. I'm your emotional fluffer.

I'm there whenever you need a guy.

You want a cup of tea, I'll make it.

You lose your phone, I'll call.

You're my friend. That's what friends do.

I'm you boyfriend without the rewards.

Yeah.

You're saying you want the...?

No! No, no, no, no, no. Not with you. Blecch!

Don't say "blecch!"

I don't want it.

I'm not disgusting. It's not an unheard of thought.

Blecch!

Come on. Admit it, you've thought about it.

You and me, sexually? Nope.

Blecch! Never thought about it once.

Don't lie.

Not on purpose.

Sleeping Nick is a totally different guy.

You know you did when you walked in on me doing deep lunges.

Yeah, check my Google history, Jess.

It's filled with girls doing deep lunges.

I mean, I'll admit I've thought about it.

Yeah.

When was this?

Last year. Just once.

Would you like to eat me?

What do you mean? Aren't you a little small?

What, are you nuts?!

What happened?

Why am I doing this?

That's what does it for you?

Yeah, I thought about it for five minutes, and then I realized it would never, ever work between us.

Yeah, I agree. That's how I see it.

Great. I'm glad we agree on something.

Me, too!

Great.

Out of curiosity, why do you think that, though?

Because you drive me nuts, Miller!

Because you're always sighing, like you're the president of the United States and you have to decide whether we're going to w*r or not.

I sigh because you sing about everything.

I do not.

? And I hate it. ?

? You sing and dance about nothing. ?


You're cheap!

You are so cheap.

I'm not cheap.

You never, ever put money in any tip jar, ever.

What are you talking about?

I've never seen you ever do that.

Last week, when we went to the coffee shop.

You put nickels in the tip jar!

You know what a jar is in my business?

Nickels! Nickels are worse than no money; it's an insult.

It's just a little boy saying, "Love me!"

"Give me attention!"

You're a bartender.

You live on tips. You should know better.

The nickel?

The only American currency...

You can't not give someone a tip Because you don't like tip jars!

...graced with the face of Thomas Jefferson.

Well, I think that's rude, Nick!

I didn't realize you were on the fence about the Louisiana Purchase...

You hate everything!

...Jessica!

And I could never live with that.

I barely live with it now!

But you need me to have sex.

That's what you think?

I'm calling Sam, and we're gonna go on a date.

And we're gonna talk our faces off.

Okay?

Good luck. Good luck with that.

Can't find your phone, Jess?

No, I'll find it.

'Cause I'm not calling you this time.

Are you happy now?

Now I have to get to know the guy I'm sleeping with.

That was a pocket dial!

That was an ill-timed pocket dial!

I will not explain myself!

I just wish I had a lot more solo Tugg time.

You know?

Well, you can be Tugg with me.

Sometimes I think that I'm just a riddle that, well, even I can't solve.

Yeah, see? I tried to solve it again.

Hi.

Hi.

I hope it's okay, I invited over some of the Kappas For Romney.

Kappas For Romney!

Courtney.

Such a pleasure. - Courtney.

I'm April.

April.

They just got so excited when I said I met one of the Romney boys.

No, who wouldn't be?

Did you ask him?

I think April's in love with your brothers.

Who isn't?

Who's the shy one?

Who's the joker? Who's tried coffee?

April, you're such a spaz.

Yeah, no, nobody gets rowdy like us Romney boys.

Just a bunch of alphas, you know what I mean?

Yeah.

That is, of course, unless we're fishing on Lake Winnipesauke.

There's nothing that I love more than just getting out on the water with Dad, the freezing cold dawn, a couple of cold beers in hand.

Having that one quick moment...

Your dad doesn't drink. He's a Mormon.

Well, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.

You know, we just buy them to support American breweries.

Then we dump them in the lake.

'Cause we're Americans.

So... um...

I want a casual sex affair, just like in the movies.

Nice.

But it turns out...

I need some conversation first.

So...

If you want to hang...

No.

...Hang out more...

I don't...

I don't want to hang out more.

Okay.

Because, if I hang out with you, it's just the truth, I'm gonna fall in love with you.

It's just how I am. I can't separate things out.

Question:

Under what circumstances would you build a dresser for a woman?

And this is, like...

and I'm not interested in sleeping with her?

Um...

Am I being blackmailed?

No.

Is it like a...

it's like a Make-A-Wish Foundation type thing?

No.

I mean... Yeah. Marriage.

You know, anything besides marriage is a...

you know, an abuse.

An abuse?

Yeah, you can't do that to a friend.

Unless your friend's a chump.

Or a certified carpenter... that would work.

Wait a minute. This isn't a sex thing, is it?

Because I... you know, I can't pleasure a woman and build a dresser at the same time, you know?

I'm not God.

Hey.

Hey!

Hey! Hey, hey, hey, what's going on, man?

Are you going to the dark place?

I'm not going to the dark place, okay?

I did what you said, I told her I didn't want to be her fluffer, and it went great.

Then what is wrong with you? Get up, man.

Look, I did what you said, and I feel terrible.

Because you didn't set boundaries.

I don't know what that means, Winston.

As a friend, you can lift a heavy object, but you can't drive her to the airport, okay?

You can hold the elevator, but only if you see her running down the hallway saying, "Hey, man, please can you hold the elevator?"

No picnics, no mini-muffins and never Adele.

Adele?

Never Adele.

Adele's amazing.

No Adele.

No concerts, no music, no T-shirts, no nothing.

But guys and girls...

Never Adele!

A little Adele.

Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!

Nick! You're gonna calm down, okay?

You want my help or what, man?

Yes.

Don't be so intense.

Most importantly...

you will not build her that dresser.

It's furniture.

It implies that one day, you will share it with her.

And that's not gonna happen.

You're right. You're right.

Are-are you spelling it right?

Two "G"s, silent "B."

Here's a picture of the whole family.

And you are not in it.

Yeah, well, somebody had to take the picture, Megan.

Just admit it. You're not a Romney.

I'm not a Romney? Would a non-Romney know this?

That Ma and Pa never go to bed angry.

That there are 16 grandchildren, Allie, Joe, Thomas, Gracie, Wyatt, Parker, Miles, Jonathan, Sawyer, Nate, Nash, Mia, Owen, Soleil, Nick and Chloe.

Those are just facts you got from the Internet.

I'm proud to be a Romney.

Okay? I'm proud to have had a dad that was around when I was growing up.

A dad that took me camping, a dad that spent Saturdays with me, throwing... throwing the football.

A dad that gave me a wink when I left for prom night and said, "Be safe, son."

When I think of a dad like that, I'm proud not only of the Romney name, but of this country.

God bless Mitt Romney.

God bless America.

It's a candid sh*t from the governor's biography.

The caption says,

"The whole family."

Nitpicking turns me off.

You're all horribly unattractive to me.

Tugg Romney, out.

Hey.

I got your text.

When you're going through a Taylor Swift-like range of emotions, I should come over, right?

You were the only one that I could talk to.

Being brown, you have the wisdom of 1,000 white women.

All right.

What happened with that girl?

Winston.

Winston.

Hey.

Are you serious right now?

Well, I...

He-he said it was okay.

She is off limits.

Go call your girlfriend.

You obviously have things you need to work out.

Fine. Fine.

But for the record, it was loving and tender and you squeezed my hand at the end.

Get out of here!

Deviant.

Okay, so...

tell me what happened.

Well, I'm back to being Schmidt.

I'm gonna miss it, though.

Being a Romney.

Schmidt, your life would not have been better if you were a Romney.

Cece, look, my dad left when I was eight.

Okay?

And then he went and had three kids with his new wife, and me and my mom were just these two weirdos who belonged to nobody.

Until she started spending all this time with this woman from work who...

who she still lives with today.

Schmidt.

He's your dad. All right?

Find a way to forgive him for not being a presidential candidate with great hair.

Forget it.

No one understands.

There, I thought you needed that, okay?

Just take a breath, and it will...

Shh.

Shh, shh, shh.

It's like memory foam.

Call your dad.

You've been cheating on me in your mind?

Yes, but, like, to be fair, you were there.

A lot of times, you would just pop up mad, but you were there.

Winston, come on, it's fine. Look, you can think about whatever you want to think about.

I know I'm the one you want to be with.

Come on, want to come upstairs and watch some SVU?

You want to watch SVU right now?

Well, I'm too wound up to watch Raymond.

Look, sometimes after a big fight, I like to cool off with some TV.

What do you mean, big fight?

We just had a fight.

We hardly talked.

Like, I want to talk, I want to fight, I want to do something!

Well, maybe we can fight in your mind.

Hey.

Stop.

Jess...

Stop. Do not... Come on, Nick.

Don't build that dresser, please.

Jess, it's fine. I have another one.

I need, like, three to build this thing.

I can't let you fluff me.

I can't let you work in emotional p*rn.

You have too much to offer.

Forget it, Jess.

I'm building you the dresser.

I love this stuff.

It's like high-stakes Legos.

Okay, but...

I didn't know what I was doing to you.

I've always had relationships in different boxes.

Friends in one box, boyfriends in another.

But now...

it's messy, and...

I don't want to screw up what I have with you.

You're too important to me.

It's different with us.

We're just two people who want to be friends, but are sometimes attracted to each other.

Ha!

No, no...

You have thought about the reward.

That's not what I said.

My calculations were correct.

I love deep lunges.

Just don't make a big deal of it.

I just don't need a bunch of people telling me what we can and can't do together.

That pisses me off.

If I want to build you a dresser, I'm gonna build you a damn dresser.

But if you want to have dates before sex, just do me a favor and have them with the guy you're having sex with.

Agreed.

Good.

Maybe I should just stop trying with Sam.

I'm old-fashioned below the belt.

I've got a Civil w*r-era piece of equipment, and that's all she wrote.

All right.

I got to give you something now.

Something... really close to my heart.

That's Nick's Sexy Mix.

AKA the original fluffer.

"The Humpty Dance"

does it for you, Nick?

Do your thing, girl.

Get crazy.

When we're done, I want you to immediately turn this off.

Yes.

Ooh...

Well, it took a year, she's finally cooking and cleaning.

I knew this would pay off eventually.

Does everybody like egg pie?

Jess, I believe the word that you're looking for is "frittata."

Oh, Schmidt, stop staring at my fritta-tas! (laughs)

You gotta do something, Nick.

My sister's coming, my mother's coming.

I love being unemployed. I love it!

If I'd lost my job a week ago, I'd be deep in a p*rn hole by now.

Five-second rule.

The images, the things I would have seen by now. It's...

Jess, are you cooking a frittata in a saucepan? What is this, prison?

Jar.

Jar. That's a jar for sure.

Yeah, I know.

I already got the money ready.

No!

What? Oh, no!

SCHMIDT: Damn it!

No!

Jess! What is this?!

I just finished that last night. Isn't it great?

SCHMIDT:

Felt art?

Nick?

I'm on it.

What?

What photograph were you working from? My hair hasn't looked like that in three weeks.

Your hair looks just like that, Schmidt.

Yeah, your hair looks just like that.

You are perfect in that.

This is making me furious.

It's multi-cloth collage.

Insane!

Jess, can I have a word with you?

Take a break!

You're looking at this the wrong way.

This is the first time you don't have to be anywhere or do anything.

Right.

You could make weird art or don't make weird art.

But the point is you can do whatever you want.

You could go off the grid. You could be an outlaw.

I'm not really someone who goes off the grid, Nick.

Whoo-hoo! I'm off the grid!

I'm so far off the grid, that everybody's all, "She's off the grid!"

And then I'm all,

"I don't play by your rules."

I can drink at 11:00... a.m.

Yeah, that backfired pretty quickly.

High five.

âª Who's that girl? âª

âªWho's that girl?âª

âª It's Jess. âª

Look at that, look at that, look at that.

My mom always said I was a late bloomer.

Wait till she sees this mustache! Bam!

That's not a shadow?

What?

'Cause your nose makes a shadow right over your...

Oh, now it is a mustache. You look adorable.

Winston, I need you to be honest with me, okay?

Yeah.

Does your mother not like me?

Yes.

She does, she does not like me?

Schmidt, she loves you.

Good, good, because, you know, historically speaking, I'm like, catnip to tough-talking African-American women.

It's 'cause I don't front, know what I mean?

Don't do that.

A'ight.

What is that?

What's your name?

I'm Nick.

Nick's name is Nick!

Nick, meet Nick.

Hi, Nick.

You guys even look alike.

Look at that turtle face.

Nick, want these kegs behind the bar?

Yes.

Yes.

He was talking to me.

He was talking to you.

NICK: Andy, I'll go get your check, bud.

Oh, hey, Winston, you know, you can just have the hummus in there, okay? It's giving me the toots.

Hey, Schmidt.

Hey, Alisha.

You look great. Wow.

Thanks.

It's like they stretched the ugly out of Winston.

Hmm.

How's the hoops?

Good, it's good.

Yeah?

Very impressive, pro ball.

I mean, women's pro, but still. Swoosh.

I was working in real estate, but I got laid off, so...

I got laid off last week!

I don't even know what to do with myself.

I just told myself it was a chance to start over.

Yes.

Be someone That I've always wanted to be, you know?

I'm Jess.

Hi. How are ya?

I'm Bearclaw!

Bearclaw helps me with the deliveries.

Hey.

Here's your check, my man.

Thanks, man.

Maybe I'll see you around. I'm in the phone booth.

Um, oh, it was nice to meet you, Jess.

Nice meeting you, too.

And, Jess, you met me.

Nice to meet you both.

Hey, Nick, I know what I'm gonna do with all my free time.

Him.

You like him?

Mother, may I? Can you give him my phone number?

Yeah, absolutely.

(purrs)

Winston, your sister got so hot.

I'm gonna have to Shaq att*ck her.

Schmidt.

May I have your blessing? 'Cause I'm gonna be, Like, dribbling up the court.

Schmidt.

Boom. Technical foul.

Boom. Illegal use of the hands. Boom.

Hello, Schmidt.

Charmaine.

Charmaine!

The loft just became Big Mama's House!

Give me a hug.

You gonna take care of this?

He's d*ad to me.

Okay.

Hi. Excuse me. Are you Katie?

I'm Sam from Cupid Match.

And I'm the girl from my dreams of you.

You are Katie, right?

Yeah.

Finally.

I am. I'm Katie. Hi.

Hi. So many e-mails back and forth.

How's the little dog of yours?

I had to put her-im down on the way here.

Oh, my God!

I know.

Can I tell you something?

Uh, not really.

I'm you from the future.

Well, that's a first.

Nick, I traveled from the future to find you.

I'm a time traveler.

Does everybody tip badly in the future, or is it just you?

You don't believe I'm you, do you?

Absolutely not.

Well, I know you didn't shower this morning.

Well, good guess. It's a Wednesday.

I know a girl broke your heart and you gave up on love.

I know sometimes you get mad and you don't know why.

I know you're a bartender because you like three feet of bar between you and everyone you meet.

Well, I mean...

Chew on that, you clown.

Wait. Hey, don't-don't say all that weird stuff and then just leave!

You were wrong about the bar!

But everything else was right.

What was the band that we...? I know...

I'm in.

I've been to

48 Creed shows, so...

Forty-two.

No way!

Way!

Are you serious?

Wow!

Way to go, Cupid Match.

Yeah. Hey, hold still.

You got a little hair...

on your nose.

(mouthing)

Let's just say, hypothetically, we live in a world where time travel exists, okay?

So if that is the case...

One, Marie Antoinette. Two, Cleopatra.

Three, young Ann-Margret.

Four, old Ann-Margret.

Would you shut up, you clown?! I'm being serious!

I'm talking about real time travel here, Schmidty.

And I made an astute observation off of that.

I might have met future me.

Who knows about this?

Nobody. You're the first person I've told, obviously.

Whoa.

If I find out how you die, Do you want me to tell you?

Don't worry. I already know. It's one of these moles.

See this little S.O.B. right there?

That's the guy?

I've been eyeing him for a while.

That's one's gonna turn green one day, and then (snaps fingers)

there you go.

Schmidt's d*ad.

I met me in my bar!

Ask him when I meet Kanye.

'Cause I vision...

I'm talking about real time travel.

I have visions of me, Kanye, BeyoncÃ©...

I could figure out what happened...!

Hey, can I talk to you guys?

What's up, baby?

Don't call me baby. Seriously, stop.

Come on, spill. - Don't wink at me.

What?

Okay, look, I had the best sex of my life last night.

He brewed me like a fine chamomile.

Oh, so that was you.

I thought that was a couple bums fighting.

It wasn't.. It was me having sex.

Mm. - I left my body, went up to heaven, saw my grandparents, Thought it was weird that I saw my grandparents, came back down, I became a werewolf, I scared some teenagers.

I came back into my body. Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie.

And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets.

SAM:

Katie?

KATIE:

Hey, Sam.

These are my roommates.

Hey.

Hey, uh, Katie, we're running late for dance rehearsal.

Yes. Oh.

We're wondering if we're doing leg warmers today...

Leg warmers.

Oh, we are. Leg warmers?

You guys are dancers, too?

Yeah, I mean, mostly Katie, Yes, yes.

But yeah.

What, do we not look like dancers?

No, I mean...

This one's a leaper.

No, I knew he was gonna go there.

You're a leaper. You are.

Yep. He is. They call him, uh, Cricket.

Yeah, Cricket the leaper.

Let me see you leap.

Cricket, show him how you leap.

I'd love to see you leap.

Don't get self-conscious now. You've got this.

You've got it.

You're really getting a show here,

'cause he normally doesn't do this for a private audience.

Do the tribal stuff.

All right. Yeah.

SCHMIDT: Beautiful.

SAM: Is he okay?

I'm kind of hearing some popping.

SCHMIDT:

No, no, Look at that vert.

Breathtaking.

Faster. Faster.

SCHMIDT:

Grasshopper.

And I'm done.

All right, you know what? I'm gonna go to a couple brunches, maybe take a nap, rehydrate. Come here.

(grunts)

NICK:

This is so normal.

This isn't upsetting at all.

Yah!

(laughs)

Oh, man.

All right, I'm gonna text you later.

Yep.

And if you find my underwear just, uh...

keep it.

(whispers):

I got to go.

SCHMIDT:

Wow, Katie's an animal.

Katie's the best.

Nice.

I love being Katie.

Vintage Katie.

Like an animal you are.

Katie knows how the sausage gets made.

Ew.

Katie...

Has a job, y'all.

I think I should just stay Katie.

Maybe you should watch a cautionary tale that I like to call The Nutty Professor.

What's Katie gonna do, Nick?

She's got some pretty dark needs.

Well, I hope you don't like him,

'cause you're not coming back from, "Just kidding. My name is actually Jess."

(phone chimes)

"Hey, I got your number from Nick. Want to hang?"

What's this?

I gave your number To the guy that you like from the bar. You asked me to.

Oh, my God.

I forgot.

I've never had two guys into me before.

What's happening?

Jess, I'm gonna tell you what's happening.

Okay, there comes a time in every person's life when... for no reason whatsoever they are irresistible to the opposite sex.

For me, it was the third night of Hanukkah '96, which I like to refer to as The Night of the Shoshannas.

For me, it's every time I Jet Ski.

This is not fair.

It is gonna take all of my game to sleep with Winston's sister.

What?

What?

And then there's you, Who has this raw animal magnetism just dropped in her lap like a sack of taters. What a waste.

I'm pretty sure it is not a waste.

Oh, it's a waste.


Jess, look, you don't have the skill to juggle men.

You wear a cardigan on top of another cardigan.

We all know you're not the best with doorknobs.

You can barely hold one thing in each hand.

You tripped the other day just standing there.

What's happening?

Okay, but Katie can juggle men.

She's out the door before you even know your wallet's gone, son.

(phone chimes)

Ooh.

He wants to cook for me.

Is there a hot way of saying I don't feel sexy after I've had a lot of cheese?

I would say no.

WINSTON (whistles):

Didn't know this was a butter Kn*fe type of place.

Don't worry, the team's paying.

If anybody asks, you're the ball boy.

Hey, Coach, put me in.

Schmidt.

Schmidt, what the hell are you doing here?

Come on, move over. Hey, y'all.

Everybody scooch, a little scoochie down.

Okay, teamwork. Defense.

Really?

A lot of money that I want to deposit into your Tyra Banks.

If he touches your sister, I'm gonna stop paying your cell phone bill.

The L.A. Sparks.

So many Sparks in one place, you're about to start the world's sexiest f*re.

Am I right?

JESS:

Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts.

Come to the professor. Let me see.

He says, "Can't stop thinking"

about what you're gonna wear tonight."

How do I respond?

With a simple...

Mm-hmm.

"Or not wear."

Okay.

Okay?

"Or not wear because sex happens naked."

Send.

Okay, let me help you with that.

"Just kidding.

Get ready for a night you will never forget."

Okay?

"Because once you see my body, you will go brain-d*ad and have memory loss."

Send.

Oh, no.

Autocorrect changed "body"

to "meat bar."

(knocking on door)

Bearclaw, what are you...

Yeah!

Oh, you're so hot.

Come here.

(sighs, whispers): I can't wait to see your meat bar.

That's why they call me Bearclaw.

You did that yourself in middle school.

See now it's retracting its claws.

Now it's contracting its claws.

Like, "Rrr, I'm gonna att*ck you in the wild."

(phone rings)

Oh, my God, phone's ringing.

Oh.

Got to take this.

I'm so sorry, it...

No, no, no, I...

It's very important.

I'll just be cooking.

I love cooking.

It's my only outlet.

Nick, Nick.

You gave my number to the wrong guy.

Wait, which one did you want me to give your number to?

Andy.

Andy is so boring.

Bearclaw just told me a ten minute joke about squirrels with the punch line,

"eat these nuts."

Seriously, he is so awesome.

Nick, I don't want to hurt his feelings.

Tell me what to do because you got me into this mess; this is your fault.

This is not my fault. I just wanted you to stop cleaning the kitchen so much, Jess.

(phone chimes)

Oh, my God.

Who's Katie?

I'm Katie.

What is happening?

Hey, mama bear.

Hey.

Yeah.

Can I tell you some... thing?

Me first.

Um, when Nick...

When Nick told me that you wanted my number, I was all like...

(bellows)

And then I was like, Nick, this might be the best thing that ever happened to me.

Now you go.

Um...

what I was gonna say was, um...

You're...

an old soul.

Hey, I wanted...

I wanted to tell you.

When I, uh, I got your text from before, and I have figured out my sex character.

And it's Sergeant Giddyap Carruthers.

Hey, if we... if we make love later, and I tell you to pretend that I'm a scary ghost, are you gonna be weirded out by that?

Bearclaw, I'm sick.

Oh.

In my... face.

Oh, no, um, I've got an a**l thermometer in my bag.

I'm really good at telling myself, and I think that I'm... I feel very feverish.

I don't think I need the thermometer.

Oh, yeah.

No, you do feel hot.

Yeah.

Now you feel even hotter.

Alisha, have a drink with me.

Schmidt, I only go out with guys who play basketball.

Well, let's play for it.

I win, you have a drink with me.

You win, I take you to brunch.

sh**t me.

Schmidt, I'm a professional basketball player.

Yeah, and I'm a guy who works in marketing that wants to give it to you.

We both have jobs;

Get over it.

Do I ever finish writing my zombie book?

Z is for Zombie?

Great title.

Do we ever get rich and famous?

Three words:

Hot, air, balloon.

Do we invent them?

No, they've been invented.

Jess or Katie?

Not now, Nicks.

Hey, tell her you're sorry.

What for?

You'll find out.

I mean, I'm sure I did something stupid, but what did I do?

You just tell her you're sorry.

What did I do?

You did something stupid.

So tell her you're sorry.

Now I know why people get annoyed with me.

It's hard to talk to us.

Hey, you know, I can't believe she asked Nick for your number and then...

Yeah, yeah, you know what, man?

We-We're perfect together.

It's like I finally found my lady bear.

See, I felt like we had a connection, too.

You know, I don't know if you ever get that feeling like, I don't know, like maybe I could marry this woman.

Oh, God.

(gasps)

Is there a woman in that bathroom being harmed?

No.

I don't buy it. Get out of the way.

I was trained for this.

Now you're gonna get the Bearcl...

Jess?

Hi, Bearclaw.

I thought you were sick.

I'm feeling better.

Why are you... if you're sick, why are nothing but your breasts covered, Jess?

Are you a doctor, is that why?

Are you a doc... is he a doctor?

Do you know these guys, Katie?

ANDY: Who's Katie?

What is going on in... Jess?

No, Nick.

I... Katie?

What is happening?!

Liar! You...

Liar!

I'm sorry, Bearclaw, but I meant Nick to give my number to Andy.

Silver lining, you have a huge fan in Nick.

She's not good enough for you, Bearclaw.

None of these people are good enough for you.

And, Sam, I'm sorry I stole you from real Katie, but ugh, look at you.

He's so handsome.

Very handsome.

I'm only human.

You know what, Bearclaw?

I would have take you to the bathroom, big guy.

He would've.

You guys are terrible people.

I want to die.

SAM: Hey, hold on a second.

Everyone just calm down. Are you really a dancer?

Are you an idiot, Sam?

JESS: Yes!

Did I tell a lie? I did.

But in my defense, I'm off the grid.

We're all off the grid. Hey, hey, we are all off the grid.

Every single one of us, especially you, handsome.

I loved you!

I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration.

You're gonna tell him how he feels after everything you've just done?

Why don't you shut up, Andy?

Yeah, shut up, Andy.

What is this, recess? Come on.

Shut up. - Shut up.

Shut up, Andy!

Nick.

It's time.

Good-bye.

No, no, Nick.

Old Nick, don't go!

(door closes)

Nick!

Nick, wait.

Please.

There's so much more I need to ask you.

I got to get back.

Why do I need to apologize to Jess?

What did I do wrong?

Make her an old-fashioned.

(chuckles)

Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.

Beep, boop, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

Beep, beep, boop, beep, ba, ba, ba, beep.

(groans)

Beep, beep, boop, boop, boo.

(rolls tongue)

I believed you.

Olde England.

Have a good trip, man.

When I was a kid, Yeah.

Watching MTV, I thought that if I played my cards right, I could grow up to be Jenny McCarthy.

Jenny McCarthy? You?

Don't make that face.

She was so beautiful with all that swearing, but you know what?

I'm not Jenny McCarthy.

I know that now.

I'm back on the grid, Nick.

You know, I always wanted to be Kurt Loder.

Kurt Loder? He never even went to the Spring Break House. He was stuck in New York, talking to Pearl Jam.

He is the elder statesman of our generation.

Why are you making me a drink? You never bring work home.

All right, this is gonna sound really weird, but in the future I might do something really bad to you, and I hope you'll forgive me.

Do you like old-fashioneds, Jess?

I've actually always wanted to try one.

How did you know?

(knocking on door)

What are you gonna do to me?

I don't know.

But it could be bad.

Like me getting drunk and peeing in your closet on all your pretty dresses.

(laughs)

I forgive you.

(knocking resumes)

Imagine all that pee on your pretty dresses, Jess.

I still forgive you.

Hey.

Sam, hi.

Katie?

Not Katie.

Yeah, uh, I'm sorry to come over here unannounced.

I didn't... I just wanted to tell you that I don't... I don't care that you lied to me.

I lied, too. Half my profile is a lie.

I am not a shy food blogger who wants a destination wedding in Scotland, okay?

I don't open up the more you get to know me.

I mean, I, you know, Internet date so I don't have to sleep with people I work with.

I do like Creed, though.

I hate Creed.

I don't care what you like or what your name is, or... anything about you.

And the good news is you don't have to care about me either.

And we can still tear each other apart.

What do you think?

You know what?

I'm gonna say yes, I think.

Yeah, let's do this.

Um...

Do we start now or later or now?

Congratulations. I see you've met the one.

(thump)

Watch out for the wall.

âª âª
âª Yeah, that's right, this cut âª
âª Goes out to all y'all that's been âª
âª Missing us for mad years, one love, yo âª
âª Yeah, that's right, he's got game âª
âª PE, 1998. It might feel good âª
âª It might sound a little something âª
âª But damn the game if it don't mean nothing... âª

You ready, ma?

'Cause I'm about to dribble this hard all the way to the hole.

Come on, Schmidty.

All right, let's do this. Come on, ma.

Oh, late, late, late, late, late.

âª I couldn't dance with another âª
âª No, I âª
âª Couldn't ask for another âª
âª Groove is in the heart, yeah. âª

Cold, cold, cold shower!

Hey, hey, hey.

You can't turn the sink on when someone's in the shower.

This is not some fancy hotel.

Okay, I'm sorry, I overslept.

I'm running late for a meeting with the vice principal.

Please get out of here so I can save a little bit of my dignity.

One, two, three, four.

âª Groove is in the heart. âª

I'm not gonna do it, Schmidt, so you can just stop asking me.

Well, I'm gonna keep asking, so just do it.

Look, I'm not doing it until you tell me why you've had time to shave your chest but not your face.

Ugh, Jess, would you please scratch an itch I have on my undercarriage?

I can't get the right angle and Winston refuses.

No, I don't have time, Schmidt.

Jess, please, I-I ... this is awful.

I feel like I dropped something in there.

You hear that? Loose change.

I thought we talked about you not wearing your shower diaper in the kitchen.

Excuse me, do you think this has been easy for me ...

to wash myself all summer long with a penis cast on?

Thank God this thing comes off this afternoon.

And by the way, I know what you've been thinking, and the answer is yes, I have been able to reach completion with some very precise and vigorous nipple play.

Nipple play ... off-limits.

Wait, Jess, please, I-I'm begging you.

Okay, fine.

Just get it, just get it in there in the back.

Stop moving like that.

There you go.

Oh, thank God.

What am I watching here?

What do you mean?

This is friendship, Pure unadulterated friendship.

Oh, yeah.

âª Hey, girl âª
âª What you doing? âª
âª Hey, girl âª
âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª

âªWho's that girl?âª

âª Who's that girl? âª

âªWho's that girl?âª

âª It's Jess. âª

Hi, Tanya, um, sorry I'm late.

Take a seat.

Okay.

Is everything all right?

I'll give you the bad news first.

Okay.

The bad news is, is that cutbacks are forcing me to lay off ten percent of our nontenured teachers.

That's terrible.

But the bad news is, is that it seems you are one of them.

That's not how you deliver news.

What are you doing?

Trying to make this more fun.

No.

You're right.

Tanya, I'm a really good teacher.

I care about my kids.

I spent two months in summer school with an Indian student named Vaj Rejuv and I did not laugh once, not once.

I'm sorry, Jess, but on the plus side...

you can have anything you want out of the lost-and-found box.

Okay.

Good choice.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Um, it's been an honor working here.

The dictionary defines "teacher" as...

Okay, you can take another one.

No, you can't share a bowl of cereal.

Why not?

The cast is off, gentlemen.

Great. Congratulations, man.

Good news, man.

Oh! - Oh! Yeah, take it in.

Goodness, the smell, man.

We have done nothing but love you, Schmidt.

Soak it all in, in all its foul glory.

That is not just some disgusting, salty bundle of gauze.

That is a symbol of who I was for the past two months:

The broken-penis guy.

But if there's anything that majoring in marketing with a minor in theater studies has taught me, it's that everybody has a brand.

Nick, your brand is gypsy alcoholic handyman.

Winston, your brand is Winston.

Nicholas, Winstoniel, I'm staging an event to relaunch the Schmidt brand.

It's going to happen this Saturday night, and it is going to be epic.

You're having a party to tell girls you're ready to have sex again?

Not a party;

A rebranding event.

Please tell me there's not a theme.

There most certainly is a theme ... it is a secret that will be announced on the night.

I bet it's danger.

No, you're... you're wrong. It's not danger.

It'll be announced on the night.

I really think It's going to be danger.

I'm going to go with danger.

Come on, man, it's not danger. Stop guessing danger.

Who'd you invite?

The ladies from Lululemon, my urologist, my badminton partner, my financial planner, Philip Seymour Hoffman and a guy who once wrote for a little show called Crank Yankers.

And obviously Cece.

She hasn't spoken to you all summer ...

since you broke up with her.

Yeah, I'm over it.

It's not about her. I hope she comes.

Now, let's talk venue.

Jess, oh, my God.

Are you okay?

How long have you been sitting here?

I panicked, and I grabbed the hat.

I should have grabbed the yo-yo or the slap bracelet, and now all I have is this stupid hat.

I'm sorry.

No, you're right.

I'm overthinking it. The hat's fine.

You take me home?

Yeah, of course.

I-I can't go upstairs, though,

'cause of the whole Schmidt thing.

It's going to be okay, all right?

I mean, this is the moment before something amazing is going to happen for you. I promise.

Put these on.

Is this making you feel better?

I've decided to host my relaunch event at Nick's bar.

No.

And you, my friend, are bartending.

Don't make me work for you. You can have everything else.

Come on, man. You're perfect.

You bring the heat, but you're not a thr*at in the looks department.

I get that, actually.

And only you Can make those fruity drinks that used to make the girls lose their minds in college.

Fine, I'll do it, but I'm not making those drinks.

Oh, come on, Nick. You have a gift.

Why you always trying to hide your light under a bushel?

Because, sure, I could get a girl topless, no bra, with one hollowed-out papaya, some crushed ice and two fingers of rum, but then I grew up.

Now I only want to make a drink that a coal miner would want.

Straightforward, honest.

Something that says,

"I work in a hole."

And I'm especially not making those drinks for you.

What? Why?

'Cause you can't handle it.

You drink them way too fast, and then you get weird.

Oh, come on. That was, like, years ago, dude.

I'm a changed man. I mean, look at me.

I'm wearing a suit.

A suit? Please.

That's something they put on Morgan Freeman when they let him out of Shawshank. Look at that.

What, did a magician die in that thing?

Hi.

I got laid off.

What? Are you serious?

Oh, my God.

What happened?

Obama.

It's possible I'm still in shock.

I'm going to go to my room and process what just happened.

Thank you for your attention.

Ah, this is not good. Now she's going to cry.

I hate it when she cries.

Her face gets all red and puffy.

Makes me sick.

Okay, we got to Fix this right now, guys.

Let's go. We got to do something.

Okay. Here's how this is going to go.

Hi.

You will not pity me.

No pity eyes. Schmidt, stop looking at me like I'm a fat kid riding a bike.

It's just a job. I'll get a new one.

You're going to get so many jobs, Jess. I promise.

So I just want you to go about your day and act normal.

Okay?

What's wrong with your eyes, Nick?

Stop blinking. Why are you doing that?

I just think they fired the wrong girl, kid.

Oh, for sure.

Stop. Nick!

What's up?

What's wrong with you?

You wiggin'?

Act normal, okay?

If that's what you want.

That is what I want.

That's what you'll get.

Where you going, Schmidt?

Sorry. This way.

Bye.

Hey, hey.

Hey.

How you doing, kid?

Great.

My boobs are loving this unemployed thing.

They don't have to go to boob jail every day.

Job hunt is on.

This hospital Web site says I can earn up to $700, and all I have to do is be infected with dengue fever.

Are you sure you're okay?

For the thousandth time, yes.

I know you've been waiting all week for me to break down, but I'm fine.

Just be normal.

I'm being normal.

You're crossing your legs.

I always do this.

You've never crossed your legs in your entire life.

I didn't even know you were that flexible.

Well...

And stop being nice to me.

What, I'm not normally nice to you, Jess?

No. You're mean, like a crazy old man.

"I'm Nick. I hate sunshine.

"When did gum get so fancy?

This escalator goes too fast."

Be mean.

Look sharp, you dumb-ass.

Sorry. That... that was in my head a little.

Look sharp, you dumb-ass.

No. Tighten up!

That's terrible.

I don't have it today. I don't know what it is.

Can you believe that the zoo wouldn't let me borrow their white tiger?

I mean, the nerve.

I'm going to be sitting in the back of the party, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's going to be like,

"Look at that idiot who couldn't even get a big cat."

Schmidt, you need a tiger.

I need a job.

Hire me.

No.

Here...

No, I'm not going to...

Schmidt!

What are you...?

Hire me. I am a people person.

I'm great at parties.

I can make any kind of balloon animal, as long as it's a worm or a snake...

No, Jess.

Come on.

Help a brother out.

Jess, you just got laid off, okay?

I can't have an emotionally vulnerable person on my crew.

Tonight is about one man's functioning penis.

I wouldn't say functioning.

I saw what you did to the toilet seat.

And I'm not unstable. I just need a job.

Okay, fine. You know what, Jess? Fine.

You can be my other sh*t girl.

Yes!

A sh*t girl? No, you can't be a sh*t girl.

Why not?

Because you don't have that specific hotness that shames men into spending nine dollars on a two-dollar sh*t.

She doesn't have it.

Are you saying I'm not hot?

No, no, no, I'm not... No, no, you're hot, you're hot.

Nick!

I'm saying you're the nurse That I want to wake up to after having my stomach pumped.

You know what I mean?

Its a different kind of hot ... still hot.

I'm going to be a great sh*t girl, Nick.

I pour liquids into cups every single day.

Add on top of that two years of light tap and jazz.

Please, I feel... I feel you overthinking this already.

I'm going to be the best sh*t girl in the world.

Cheers!

Cheers.


Getting my costume.

Hiya, big boy.

What's your poison?

Oh...

What?

Yeah, interesting choices.

It's a great hat. Can I have it?

Let's get rid of that.

I've decided that tonight my name is Ivy, and I'm studying to be an actress, and I'll sleep with you if you give me a part in a Paramount picture.

Do you have another Outfit in your car, or are you going to stick with this one?

Hey, young man, why weren't you drafted?

You like someone?

Good stuff.

Schmidt! Just the guy I was looking for.

So the theme of the party is...

Is danger.

That's right, but it's on a level that you couldn't possibly understand, Nick.

Okay.

Just, where... where is the other sh*t girl?

I don't know, boss.

Here I am.

Casey. Thank you for joining us. Great.

Here's where it's at.

I don't work with amateurs.

I don't split tips.

Things get a little freaky in here, I'm out the door because I'm a little diabetic and I don't need a hassle.

And also, I do accept payment in the form of whippets because I've got a PhD;

a Pretty Heavy Drug Problem.

Oh.

How old are you?

Twenty-six.

Thank you for your honesty.

Yeah! Who's up?

Okay, you jerk, come here. Stupid jerk.

Who wants a sh*t of firewater?

Anybody want me to wet their whistle?

Hey, Schmidt.

It's working, Nick. Look at all these beautiful ladies.

And this is just the beginning, man.

I can take this to the next level whenever I want.

You know why? 'Cause I got something up my sleeve.

Schmidt, please, nothing up your sleeve.

It never works!

Remain in your seat and finish the exam, Mr. Schmidt.

You know, in Student Health Services, they still call that

"Schmidting the bed."

Why are you proud of that?

What the hell is this?

Come on, Schmidt, you know I don't make girly drinks any more.

I didn't buy that stuff.

You didn't buy this? Then who did?

What's my name?

Casey!

You're all a bunch of jerks.

Yes! My penis is working!

Casey!

Hey. - Hey. Hey-hey!

Cece.

I had to check out the new and improved Schmidt.

Been hearing so much about it, so...

I'm really glad that you came.

Look, I wanted to tell you...

I want you to meet Robby, my, uh, my boyfriend.

Your what?

There he is.

The one shaped like a Liberty Bell?

It's a great party. Thank you for inviting us.

Flip it, man, flip it!

I'm flipping it!

Did you guys see Cece's new boyfriend, the commoner?

Oh, wow, Schmidty, you really lowered Cece's bar.

There's got to be an explanation for this, like he's the Lord of Winterfell or he's working with a real piece of pipe.

Schmidt? Schmidt, don't get hung up on that guy.

And here comes the weirdness.

Not weird, just a guy who really wants a drink.

Mm-mmm! Mmm...

Mmm!

It's like an expl*si*n of fruit!

There it is.

Look at me being so naughty!

So naughty.

Hey.

I'm Schmidt.

I, too, was a sexual partner of Cece.

Welcome to the party.

Thank you for having me.

Let me just tell you this is a very impressive party.

There's speakers everywhere. There's one over there.

I saw two on the back wall.

Oh, there's one right there. Didn't see that one before.

Yeah, there's a lot of speakers. Lot of...

Lots of speakers. Yeah.

So, so what's your deal?

I mean, do you vacation in Europe ever?

No. You know, I've never left California in my life.

You in a band?

I don't, I don't like music. What's up with me, you know?

You work for Goldman then?

For who?

This feels good. I'm gonna go.

Congratulations on your penis, man.

What's your name?

Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Oh!

Could I get a broom?!

Look at my butt.

Look at my butt, stupid jerks.

Hey, Jess.

Nick, I'm fine.

I don't need you to be nice to me right now.

Okay. You want me to be mean?

Yes.

I'll give you mean, Jess.

This is the easiest job in the whole world!

The only thing easier than this is passing out cigarettes to prisoners.

And what if I wanted to take a body sh*t off you?

Oh, yeah! I can't because you're wearing a turn-of-the-century bathing costume.

How's this? Are you getting mad or are you happy with this?

It's good. That's really good.

So stop feeling sorry for yourself, kid, and get up on that bar and shake that piece of plywood that you call an ass!

That's too far!

Yeah, yeah, I agree. You got a great ass.

That is too far!

That is too far.

This is so fun!

âª Sexy girl all around the world âª

No hat. No hat!

âª Just shake your hips and put that ass to work âª
âª Sexy girl all around the world âª
âª Just shake your hips and put that ass to work âª
âª Sexy girl all around the world âª

Yeah!

âª Just shake your hips and put that ass to work âª
âª Sexy girl all around the world âª
âª Just shake your hips and put that ass to work âª

You know, this Robby guy's got nothing on me.

Right.

I think I can get Cece back.

Seriously, just let it go.

I just need to remind her how amazing I am.

Luckily, I've got something up my sleeve.

Schmidt, no, no! Schmidt, don't!

Schmidt, no sleeves, please!

sh*t girl, sh*t girl!

sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl!

sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl, sh*t girl!

sh*t girl! sh*t girl!

sh*t girl!

I'm a sh*t girl.

Oh.

I'm a sh*t girl.

Hey, J-Jess, Jess.

Jess, where are you going?

What am I doing, Nick? I'm a teacher.

I'm not a sh*t girl.

f*re...

the most dangerous element of all of the elements.

Now I'm doing this.

Okay, let's see here.

And then now I'm doing this.

Sure. And now I'm not sure what I'm doing.

I'm not actually quite sure how to stop this.

Um, this is definitely real f*re.

I'm very apologetic. I think everyone should leave.

Um, thank you very much for coming.

There's party favors at the door.

I'd like to thank my urologist for coming.

Oh, wait. No, no, no, everybody, look.

I'm okay. I got it under control.

Cece, watch this one.

Hey, look, Cece. f*re!

Where's Robby?

Pulling the car around.

You really scared him.

Why haven't you called me back in two months, Cece?

You are the one who broke up with me.

I don't see you until you show up here tonight with... with a boyfriend?

And please, please tell me he's on some sort of medication that's making him temporarily bloated.

Come on, okay?

You and I both know we never would have worked.

We are far too alike.

Both so beautiful.

You're gonna be fine. You know that, right?

Hey, uh, Cece, I...

I got to know, why him?

I mean, what, what is his brand?

He's just a good guy.

And I'm...

too dangerous?

Yeah, that's it.

I'll see you around, Schmidt.

Yeah.

Fun fact:

There's a reason why guys nickname me "T-Ball."

When they step up to the plate, they never strike out.

Honey, what happened to you in your life that made you like this?

I graduated from MIT, and then I got into a horrible accident where I lost half my brain.

There it is.

I came back to say good-bye.

I figured that.

I was kidding myself.

I love teaching.

It's who I am.

What if I can't do anything else?

Jess, come on. I can't do anything, and look at me.

I'm kind of fine, you know?

It's just that being a teacher was all I ever, ever wanted to do.

It just, it just sucks, you know?

Yeah, life sucks!

And then it gets better, and then it sucks again.

Yeah.

And then, and then it just...

Sucks.

...sucks.

Nick.

What?

Will you be mean to me one more time?

Look sharp, you dumb-ass!

You look sharp!

You're a terrible sh*t girl!

You got hoof hands and a plywood ass, kid!

You call that a sh*t girl outfit, you dumb-ass?

I got mixed up ... I thought it was a cigarette girl.

That is what happened.

You look like a cigarette girl.

âª The chills that you spill out my back keep me fill âª
âª With satisfaction when we're done âª
âª Satisfaction of what's to come âª
âª I wouldn't dance for another âª
âª I wouldn't dance for another! âª
âª Groove is in the house. âª

Danger!

Here you guys go. Some cookies.

Wow.

Okay, great. Um, as you guys know, I'm moving in with Caroline, and I'm glad we can talk about this like adults.

Caroline is, uh, quite the baker.

Anything else, anyone?

You're making a huge, life-ruining mistake by moving in with a woman who turned you into an agoraphobic, turtle-faced, borderline alcoholic.

I'm going to start over,

'cause this did not go the way I had planned.

As you guys know, I'm leaving, so there are some things we need to work out.

Yeah, like, what am I going to do with all that extra money I have now that I don't have to cover for you any more?

Okay.

Maybe I'll buy a city.

Oh, and you can open a mall And call it Winston's Corners.

What are you guys doing?

You're just sitting here and letting this happen?

What else are we going to do?

The guy obviously knows what he wants.

I do.

When Nick leaves, I'm going to call a plumber and just throw cash at him while he works.

Fitties and hunnits, hunnits, hunnits.

Look, while you're at it, can you please call an exterminator so we can get rid of that crime against nature?

Yeah, he's not fooling anyone.

You think, just 'cause he's a snappy dresser, the mice don't see the hammer?

Mice come from all over the building to laugh at that dummy witch.

Is this a freaking carob chip?

What, are you trying to buy our love with hippie chocolate?

You idiot.

Aren't you going to miss this, Nick?

âª Who's that girl? âª âªWho's that girl?âª

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl?

âª It's Jess. âª

Winston, can you take me to the doctor tomorrow?

He's taking the bandages off.

Wow.

The old Washington Monument.

Ready to serve this great nation once again.

Can you stop?

What?

It's time to make this horse into a unicorn.

Can we save this talk until after we're done interviewing Neil here to take Nick's room?

Hey, don't worry about me.

I could talk about my dingus all night long.

Neil, tell us about yourself ... you know, uh, anything we should know, aside from the fact that you responded to our Craigslist ad with a fax?

Well, um, yeah, my name is Neil.

Um, just coming out of a pretty hairy divorce.

I am in human resources.

Well, I used to be.

I had the unique, uh, experience of having to let myself go.

I did not take it well.

Let me ask you a question.

I would love for you to save your questions till the end.

Are you going to be a wuss about things like crabs and bedbugs?

Like, crabs from Maine?

I hope you like feminist rants,

'cause that's kind of my thing.

Neil, she's just saying this to scare you.

What are you...

What are you doing?

Shut up.

I'm a cutter.

Neil, uh, I want you to give us a minute, okay?

I got to go talk to my roommates in the bathroom. Guys? - Okay. Yeah.

You're acting insane.

I'm acting insane? That guy's insane.

Look, Jess, when you moved in, we all had to roll with it.

To be fair, you do some pretty weird stuff.

You know, I still can't get used to the way you let us know when you're using the toilet.

I'm good with Neil.

I am, too.

What are you guys doing?

Nick's leaving.

You're his friends.

Aren't you going to fight for him to stay?

You're in.

Ah, yes! Okay.

And get ready for songs,

'cause I am kind of a troubadour.

This is happening, Nick. This is happening.

Whoa, whoa! Why you taking back your lamp?

I think you just answered that when you called it my lamp.

No, man. Squatters' rights.

What's wrong? You still afraid of the dark?

What? No. Dude.

'Cause, if you are, I'll leave this behind.

Nick, first of all, I'm not afraid of the dark.

But if I were afraid of the dark, that would be a totally rational, adaptive evolutionary response.

Good night, Winston.

That's ridiculous.

I'm not afraid of the dark.

Good night, sweetheart.

Unless the monsters get you.

Hey.

You came.

Whoa.

What you got in there?

It's a hard cast.

Yeah, things didn't go quite like we had hoped at the doctor.

Yeah, so I told the guy I had never been snowmobiling in my life, you know, and...

Oh, God!

That's not my penis.

But look, on the bright side, it is impossible for me to get aroused in this thing.

Here, watch ... say something hot to me.

Fresh-pressed linens.

Nope, nothing.

Not an inch.

Like a swaddled baby.

Hey, Cece.

They're ready for us.

Oh, okay.

Just hang out, okay? Have fun.

That's right. Ride that m*ssile.

Grip it. Yeah.

You've got a whole t*nk full of jet fuel.

You're heading straight for the sun.

What the hell w*r is this?

All right, turn around and face him.

Am-am I...

Am I supposed to want to buy a m*ssile?

I don't understand.

Just pounding the drum of w*r.

What-what, did no one listen to Eisenhower?

All right, so that's everything.

I took my fair share of rubber bands, so I don't want to hear about it.

In my room, you will find a shoe box.

In that box, there is a guinea pig that I said I would bury, so please deal with it.

There's a corpse in your room?

All right, guys, well, thanks for helping me move.

What are we standing in a circle for, like a bunch of weirdos? Let's go.

Hey, Nick?

Yeah.

Why are you rushing this?

You have so much time.

Why not just...

take a second and think about this?

I feel confident.

I-I couldn't be more confident, Jess.

Are you?

Yeah.

Are you?

Yes.

Are you really?

Thanks for helping me move.

I love the way he smelled.

Caroline and I are starting a whole new life together.

Right now, we're trying to decide between eggshell and soft mint for the walls.

My gut says that eggshell is trying too hard, but soft mint is really tricky to match.

Have I told you guys about the bay windows I'm going to have?

Yes, you have.

Yeah, you just did.

They are stunning, right?

I'm going to curl up in those like a damn cat.

That's the place.

That's-that'sthe place right there?

Right there, yeah.

Aren't you going to stop?

Yeah, seems like I should.

Um, hey-hey, Nick.

Yeah.

What are you doing?

I'm freaking out! Yeah!

What are you...?

Oh, no.

Oh, Nick Miller's freaking out again!

Whoop-de-whoo.

What's new?

Come on!

What the hell? You think he's okay, man?

Oh, no, no, no, he's totally fine.

We do this every day.

We just never invite you, Winston.

What have I done?!

Hey, Nick, I'm pretty sure you overshot the apartment by like 140 miles!

Let's just hop back in the truck, turn around and go home.

Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Okay? Okay.

This is crazy that I drove out here.

Yeah, it is.

Give me the keys. I'll drive you back to Caroline.

Caroline... no!

Well, that was unexpected.

âª I like to move in, move in, I like to move in, move in âª
âª I like to âª
âª Move in. âª

I like it quiet, quiet.

Okay, I rode up in the elevator with that guy, and something growled in that box.

I hope he has a pet. That would cheer me up.

Um, is Schmidt here?

No, he's helping Nick move ... but, uh, Neil is.

Do you want to do a sex-only thing with him?

He came by my sh**t earlier and was so jealous.

He was freaking out the entire time.

Oh.

It's him, so...

Hi, Schmidt.

How's it going?

How's the new apartment?

Does it smell like, uh, new paint and compromise?

What?

Where?

There's not much sunlight left.

What are you afraid of, the dark?

No, I'm not afraid of the dark.

Worried about Schmidt. He's a Jew in the desert.

I don't want him to wander.

That's Caroline. Now, what do I tell her?

Tell her there's freaking f*re ants everywhere.

Give me a sec.

Hey.

Nick, where are you?

In the desert.

The what?

Yeah, I kind of...

I kind of freaked out.

Look, I know it's a lot.

Just get back here as soon as you can, and we'll...

we'll figure it out.

Really?

I love you.

I love you, too.

Think I overreacted by throwing my keys earlier.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah. I don't know why I ever doubted Caroline. She's the best.

So, why the hell would you throw your damn keys away?!

I deserve this.

I'm going to k*ll you!

Hey, Winston, no.

The boat is going down!

All right, all right.

Calm down. Nick!

I'll k*ll you! I'll k*ll you!

Enough!

Would you stop it? There's v*olence everywhere!

Why are we fighting? Why are we fighting?

Oh, good.

Oh, thank God.

Hey, Jess!

What took you so long?

Let me tell you something ... you never want to lose a race against the night.

Nice new place, Nick.

It's very spacious.

Yes, I'm an idiot, Jess.

Really nice.

Hey.

That's for you.

What happened at the sh**t?

You... you kind of left before I had a chance to say good-bye.

Good stuff, sure.

It was hard to tell where you stopped and Goggles McHardBody began.

That's my job.

Gino is just some guy that I see around the office, except for, in my office, they rub us down with baby oil before we start.

Yeah, I-I get that.

Look, your business is selling sex.

Sure, you're a sex worker.

You're an idiot.

If we leave right now, I can get back to Caroline by 8:00.

Caroline?

Yeah, I-I changed my mind. Gonna move in.

Yeah, and I actually don't even care about this truck.

I'll come back and get it tomorrow.

I say we just leave now, get out of the desert.

Sounds good.

Sounds good.

Here's my question.

What's that?

How are you going to get there?

Uh, I think you're going to drive me.

Oh, I don't think so.

Wait. What?

Then why'd you come out to the desert?

What?!

What? What are you doing?

Jess.

Jess!

No!

Come on!

People, just please listen to me.

Stop throwing your damn keys!

The werewolves come out at night, man.

I don't want nobody to eat me!

I got big thighs. I got a fat ass.

Relax.

We are in the middle of the desert, and nobody is going to find our bodies!

Come here.

What?

You're having a nervous breakdown.

You're having a nervous breakdown.

The tow truck can't come until tomorrow.

Aren't you glad I stole all this beer?

Hello. Look what I found.

Don't. Put that away.

No, I have to hear it.

I-I'm begging you to put that away. It's humiliating.

I made that when I was 14.

Nick, I have to hear this.

This next song - Turn it up. No, please...

Goes out to a very special girl, Gwen Bressler.

I know you like breakfast, but how do you feel about...

"Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

"Breakfast at Tiffany's."

Oh, that is a terrible song.

This is a great song.

You guys are crazy. Listen to the lyrics.

Oh, man. I feel it in my body.

Oh...

Are you kidding me? This is in my bones.

âª I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's"?âª

No!

âª Something, something âª
âª Da da-da da-ta âª


Gwen, you don't even know my name, do you?

"How Bizarre."

Oh, yes, this is where Nick got cool again.

Oh, not you, too.

God, I'm like, I'm back.

Thank you for doing this, actually.

Make fun of me all you want.

I'm back! I'm back!

Thank you for doing this.

âª In the hot, hot sun âª
âª Suddenly, red-blue lights flash us from behind âª
âª Loud voice booming... âª

I'm gonna miss this, you guys.

Just all of us, together, making fun of Nick.

Okay.

All right, I did it.

I'm an idiot.

I see what you guys are doing.

I get it.

You're trying to force me to remember how great it is when we're all hanging out so I don't want to leave.

We're just having fun.

I get it.

You guys think I'm dumb and I make bad decisions, but this isn't that.

No.

What? Come on.

You're being crazy. Where are you going?

To get my keys.

Dude, where you going?

You're never gonna find your keys.

What's wrong with you?

You're stress-eating meat.

Hey, Jess.

How many have you had?

Like, three.

That's a lot of pig parts.

It's just Cece.

I thought it was going so well between you guys.

Yeah.

You know, she's a good egg.

She's never gonna be happy with somebody like me, Jess.

What? That's crazy.

That's why I'm gonna have to White Fang her.

Schmidt, come on!

Look, I try not to judge what you guys do, but please don't tell me things like that.

No, no, Jess, Jess.

The book: White Fang.

Oh.

This guy Befriends a wild creature.

But he must, he must set the animal free because that's what's best for it.

I know the plot of White Fang.

But the animal won't go.

So with a breaking heart, he throws stones at it until it runs away.

You-you want Cece to go away?

No.

I want her to be happy.

'Cause when-when you care about somebody, you do what's-what's best for them.

Even if it sucks for you.

Even if they're just a "woof."

A wolf?

A "woof."

A wolf.

Yeah, that's what I said, a "woof."

A wolf.

A "woof."

Come on, keys.

Hey, Nick?

Come on, they could be anywhere.

Let's come back in the morning.

I don't want to come back in the morning, Jess.

Okay, I want to be in my new bed, in my new apartment, with my new old girlfriend.

Okay, just ... look, I know I've been ...

What?

Oh, my God.

Shh-shh. Shh.

Oh, my God.

Okay, just be cool.

What do we do? What do we do?

I don't know, I don't know what to do!

Okay, but, Jess, we have to do something! - Shh.

Meep-meep!

What are you doing?

Like the Road Runner.

I know it's like the Road Runner.

Why would you do the Road Runner?

Because he's...

Don't do that, Jess.

Meep-meep!

Jess, honestly, Don't do the Road Runner to a coyote!

That's how you deal with coyotes.

Coyotes hate roadrunners!

That's how you deal with them.

Coyotes want to k*ll roadrunners!

Meep-meep!

Oh, you...

No disrespect.

It's watching us. It's watching us.

We need to talk.

All right.

This is not another one of those

"merlot is the whore of the vineyard" talks, is it?

This isn't working out.

Are you kidding... right now?

Are you trying to end this with me?

Now go on!

You heard me!

Go on!

Go on, scram!

Go!

I hate you! Go!

Go back to your kind!

Are you White Fanging me?

Sorry, what?

White Fang, Schmidt.

The only book on your Kindle.

The one that you wouldn't stop talking about.

Remember, I said, "Please,"

stop talking about White Fang."

And you said, "Someday, I'm gonna do this to somebody."

That White Fang. Uh-huh.

Why are you trying to push me away?

I saw your phone, Cece.

I saw the text message from Gino.

Your colleague.

You went through my phone?

What? No.

Winston... Winston went through your phone.

That is not okay.

This is about trust, Schmidt, okay?

It's about trust.

And I told you how this was gonna be, and I asked you to get okay with it.

How am I supposed to trust you, Cece?

You slept with me.

I mean, that doesn't say much about your taste in men.

And I have more than one book on my Kindle.

And a subscription to Cricket.

And a lot of PDFs!

Doesn't he have somewhere to be?

Well, this is a disaster.

Why did you keep driving?

I don't want to talk to you about this, Jess.

I know what you're gonna say, and I don't want to hear it.

No.

No, you don't know what I'm gonna say.

I want you to be happy.

And if that means moving in with Caroline, then I think you should do it.

That's what you think?

I think you need me too much.

No, I'm gonna be fine. I am.

I don't think so.

You know why?

Why?

'Cause I met you.

That's why I'm okay.

That's why I can do this.

What are you doing?

To b*at the coyote, you have to be the coyote.

That's what I thought you were gonna say.

That's a very dumb idea. Don't do this.

I'm not with her on this.

This is her move, not mine, sir.

No.

Oh, my God.

I did it!

Oh, my God.

I did it! I have so much dirt in my mouth, and I did it!

Come here, come here.

I did it!

Nice job!

I did it!

Oh, my God. Schmidt?

Hello?

Winston?

Oh, my goodness!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh... my goodness!

He'll be fine.

I don't know.

You guys want some candy or something?

Found it in the truck.

No.

I don't want your dirty lolly.

Guys!

Ah!

Whoo!

I survived, man.

I made it out alive.

Wait, wait, don't touch me.

Don't touch...

There's, uh, there's pee everywhere.

Like... everywhere.

It's everywhere?

Well, I didn't just pee on me.

I peed ... well, I peed on me, but other-other things peed on me, too.

I saw things, man.

I had an experience.

I think I made out with the side of a dune.

Hey!

Look, I found my keys!

Ah! Thank God!

We still on for brunch?

Gonna come help me unload my stuff tomorrow?

No, not a chance.

No, yeah, so we can't do brunch.

Just go.

Get in the car.

Unacceptable.

Good luck.

Well...

Well...

All right, I'll see you.

See ya.

Wow.

Look how pronounced Nick's couch hole got.

All this time I thought he was just sitting here drinking beer and complaining, he was making something.

Hey.

What do you think?

Hey, WNICK listeners, this one is going out to all the ladies I'm gonna meet when I grow up.

Not.

Hey.

Welcome back, you clown.

âª She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean âª
âª She was the best damn woman that I ever seen âª
âª She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies âª
âª Knocking me out with those American thighs âª
âª Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air âª
âª She told me to come, but I was already there âª
âª 'Cause the walls start shaking âª
âª The earth was quaking, my mind was aching âª

Nick, turn it off!

âª And we were making it âª
âª And you shook me all night long âª
âª Yeah, you shook me âª
âª Yeah, you shook me âª
âª All night long. âª

âª I wish I had a river âª
âª I could skate away on âª

Hey, Jess.

I brought you some tea.

Just gonna leave it right here, okay?

There you go.

So, Russell...

Ouch.

Right? I mean, who saw that coming?

Not me.

Certainly not Russell.

I guess, I guess you saw it coming.

I mean, 'cause you're the one who broke up with him.

Leave, Schmidt.

All right, fine.

I'll leave. But you know what?

Know this: you're not the only one that's hurting here, Jessica Day. The economy stinks, bees are dying, movies are pretty much all sequels now, and I...

Don't say "broken penis."

...have a broken penis.

Don't pretend to know my pain.

(song continues)

Hey, Jess.

Hi.

What's this song called?

"The River."

Hmm.

Do you like it?

Yeah, yeah, I liked the way you played it for the first time at 10:00 last night.

I liked it a little bit less at 2:00 a.m.

And now I'm kind of hoping that the sun comes up, thaws that river and that woman drowns.

Get out!

(song continues)

Russell was perfect.

What's wrong with me?

Am I self-sabotaging?

Am I secretly a Cylon?

You just didn't love him.

But what if it's me?

What if I have some idea of love in my head and it's just totally wrong?

Do not second-guess yourself, okay?

It was a tough choice, but it was the right choice.

Yeah, mm-hmm.

So what do you think about turning off that song?

I just feel like I should...

Off. Turn it off.

Ow.

âª It's coming on Christmas... âª

(song stops)

WINSTON: Oh, my God, she's d*ad! SCHMIDT: Oh, no, no, come on!

80 more times! I get it now! It's a river!

All right, now let's go and get a drink, because you really need to get out of this room.

I'm not ready.

Turn that song back on!

Caroline and I made up a dance routine to cheer you up.

No, you didn't.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna dance, and Nick's gonna clap.

Okay. I'll just clap.

You about ready now?

Yeah, I'm ready now.

Yeah, let's go.

Uh, feel it. Uh, uh.

Get it, Caroline! Get it, Caroline!

(grunting rhythmically)

Born to dance.

Dance the bump.

(both grunting rhythmically)

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

I'm gonna end up alone.

I'm gonna be a single old lady flashing people on the subway.

Jess, first of all, you're never gonna be old, because humans ... we're gonna be immortal by 2026.

And second of all, give me your phone.

Why?

Do you want to drunkenly call Russell tonight and tell him what a huge mistake you made?

You don't want to backslide, trust me.

Be quiet.

Your life is too perfect to talk to anyone in Jess's condition right now.

Look, Jess, backsliding is what happens after a clean break.

When you, when you freak out and you go crawling back and you just make everything messy and horrible.

I'm not gonna do that.

You have backslider written all over you.

Did I tell you guys that my boss invited me to play poker with him tonight?

Crazy thing, he never invites anybody to play poker with him.

I mean, come on, I'm in the prime of my life, baby.

Winston, shut up!

Shut up!

JESS:

Schmidt, I actually need my phone back.

No.

I need to call Russell to just tell him I left my pajamas there.

The fact that you were wearing pajamas in the presence of your lover tells me that that relationship was doomed from the start. No way.

Disgusting.

Don't fake me ... don't fake me out.

Are you guys playing a game?

No. No. Just chillin'.

Hey, good-lookin'.

Hey.

What can I get you?

How about one of those Nick Miller Manhattans?

Ah, straight bourbon in a plastic cup.

(chuckles)

Come with me.

Think we should show him the DVD?

What DVD?

Nick made a DVD after the last time Caroline broke up with him.

It's all the reasons why they shouldn't get back together.

We hid it somewhere in the loft.

Ooh. Intrigue.

Mama like.

I don't know that we should...

Cece's here.

Why is she dressed like a women's studies major?

SCHMIDT:

It's precautionary.

Just until my junk heals.

Ow. Owie.

Damn it.

You okay?

No, I'm not okay.

What is going on, Jess?

I was just thinking about this word that I learned from Schmidt.

Backsliding.

Oh, so you're saying I'm a backslider.

I don't know what we're supposed to do together any more.

Everything seems to turn you on.

Oh, look, Cece, a bird. Ow. Ah, damn it!

Schmidt, it's a mother bird in her nest!

Must I say it, Cece?

What?

Eggs.

Okay.

Okay, sure, look, did Caroline physically, ment*lly and emotionally abuse me for years?

Yes!

But she changed.

It's about timing.

And the first time around, we weren't ready to work at it, and now we are.

And besides, Caroline is way hotter than that voice in my head, who sounds like Tom Waits and tells me I'm a failure and that I look bad in hats.

I don't want to spend my whole life with him.

You know what I mean?

Okay.

At least you'll get a break from me tomorrow.

I've got to go visit my dadi.

What?

It's my grandmother.

Oh, your bubbe?

Yes, my...

Oh, I have a bubbe.

Uh, my bubbe is in a home.

Yeah.

Old people freak me out.

With their hands and their legs.

Just, they're like the human version of pleated pants.

Really?

Not for me.

Hey, Schmidt.

Hey.

Can I borrow your jacket?

Yeah, sure.

Thanks.

CECE:

Like, aren't into old people?

SCHMIDT:

Not at all.

I mean, just-just horr...

like giant walking raisins.

They're in a home...

It's me.

I've been thinking a lot about you.

(whispers):

Jess.

Hmm?

I can't feel my arm.

(sighs)

Oh.

Whoa.

I really can't feel it at all.

Wake up, fella.

You're gonna be late for school.

(sighs)

Genzlinger.

(sighs)

What is that?

It's an earring, man. What does it look like?

Got kind of wasted last night with Joe, and so, you know, I got my ear pierced.

This is the perfect moment.

(giggling)

Wait, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

Wait, what?

I'm gonna do.

See, this is when it gets weird between us.

One, two, three.

(grunts)

(screams)

You know, traditionally, the male of the species is more glamorous.

When's it coming out, by the way?

The earring? - No, no, the smooth jazz album you're dropping.

Hey, guys. You remember, um, Paul.

Mercedes-Genz!

WINSTON:

Genzel Washington.

It's the Genz of the world as we know it.

All right, everybody, put down your Genz and your Genzils.

Hey, Schmidt. What's up, Washington?

Um hey.

Hey.

So maybe ...

Okay.

We definitely ...

Oh yeah, that sounds...

Okay.

Okay.

Okay All right.

Backslider!

Don't.

You backslid.

Come on.

You backslid all the way down the hill and back into the parking lot.

Take off your skis and wait for your family in the lodge, Jessica Day.

Look, I think this could be good.

Paul and I had really bad timing before, and maybe I should just give it another sh*t.

Such an ugly crier.

He is the all-time worst crier.

(sobbing)

It's like he's a slow-motion sneeze.

Winston, what is in your ear?

It's hot and I love it.

Does that feed information back to Shelby to keep track of your migration patterns?

Drop it.

Please, Jess.

He just got back from Carnival.

Know what?

(whispers): These people are disgusting.

I've never been more flaccid in my life.

(laughs)

Thank God.

I mean, this place is a cardigan gold mine.

Can I get you anything, Dadi?

A hot-blooded man and a hotel room would be nice.

Oh, just get me a puzzle.

Yeah?

I raised that girl.

She is my life.

And she's not as tough as she looks.

If you hurt her, I will let myself die and then I will haunt you.

Whoa, look at this fireplace.

It's huge.

Caroline, that is not a fireplace, that is, like, a room you could safely set on f*re.

(chuckles)

Yeah, this is really nice.

It is.

So grown up.

But where's all your stuff gonna go?

Like, where will the Grateful d*ad bears dance?

Oh, I didn't realize I lived here, too.

Seriously though, what do you think about moving in?

Wait, you want to move in together?

Yeah, I mean, I feel like if we're gonna do this again, we should do it for real this time, you know?

Right.

I mean, I'm 33 years old.

You're 30 years old; we're the same age, you knucklehead.

No, I lied about that. I'm 33.

I don't want to start at the beginning again with you.

I mean, you're not... not making sense.

(school bell ringing, knocking)

Knock-knock.

Hi.

Hi back.

Um...

Hey...

I want to tell you...

I have something to tell you.

Oh, sorry, you go first.

Oh, I'll go first.

Um, I was thinking a lot about, um...

you and last night.

Right.

And we have something good.

Jess, I have a girlfriend.

What?

Yeah.

Very serious girlfriend.

Oh, my God.

Why didn't you tell me?

(sighs) When you called me last night, we had just gotten into this huge fight, and I was really confused.

You cheating on her with me?

Is that bad? That's bad.

It's really bad.

Oh, no, that's really bad.

Why would you do that?!

Now I know what Bill Clinton feels like.

Now I know how Monica Lewinsky feels!

I'm sorry I made you feel like Monica Lewinsky.

Stop crying!

You are literally the ugliest crier I have ever seen!

You cry smile.

Hey, babe, I'm here for lunch.

Oh!

Oh.

Oh, no, are you crying?

Is everything okay?

There's-there's...

I'm sorry to have to break it to you, but that is the way the electoral college works, man.

It-it seems so unfair.

So votes don't mean as much.

It upsets me, too.

(video game music playing)

I'm gonna miss you, Winston.

What do you mean?

I'm gonna miss you when your caravan moves on to the next village.

(door opens, closes)

Oh, my God!

He has a girlfriend!

He cheated on his girlfriend with me.

I'm a cheater.

P. Genz played you?

I saw her.

She looks like an Asian me.

Asian Jess. Wo ... Ow.

I can't even backslide right.

I've been her.

I've been Asian me before.

Are you gonna keep calling her "Asian me," because it's becoming a problem for me.

I don't know her name, Schmidt.

But I do know that if I were her, I would want to know what kind of person I was dating.

And that's why I have to tell her.

What? No, don't do that.

Please don't do that.

Mm-mm. Sometimes, when you make a mistake, all you can do is own up to it, all right?

Because it's something you can't fix.

Knowledge.


Take it easy, black George Michael.

I have to do it.

I have to tell her.

61 years we've been together.

14 presidents and four different Batmen.

Why don't we go for a walk?

I'm just gonna go get your sweater.

I'll be back in a second.

Oh, thanks, sweetie.

Give me one second.

Wow, so you guys are like real live Yodas, huh?

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

sh**t, cowboy.

How do you build a relationship?

How 'bout Viagra?

I use it just to keep from falling out of bed.

How does a guy like me have a chance at making someone like Cece happy?

You don't. Not with all those moles on your face.

I should just give up, huh?

That's crazy!

She needs you!

DADI: You are exactly what she needs.

(sighs)

Here's your sweater, Dadi.

Oh, thank you.

Um, I'll meet you out there in a second, okay?

Okay.

Take it easy, Burt.

(sighs)

You know, for the first time in my life I actually feel like I want something that lasts.

And I want it with you.

I feel... the same way.

You do?

(groaning)

Oh!

(moaning)

It hurts so bad, because...

What's turning you on?

Oh...

The queen of diamonds?

The bow?

Oh, my God.

The teeth in the glass?

I care about you so much.

The leaf painting?

But...

Is emotional intimacy turning you on?

(groans)

(groaning)

Are you in that much pain?

Uh, he passed out.

We need help!

Yo. What's up, man?

How'd the audition go?

What?

For the Disney pirate movie?

Ha-ha.

Hey, Mr. T called.

He wants to punch you because that earring looks stupid.

I mean, Lil' Wayne wears it, so...

Oh, Little Wayne Gonzales from Brazil?

Who came to the United States to dance and be free!

You can't touch me, baby. I'm in the prime of my life.

Tell me, what are you doing? What you been doing all day?

Oh, I'm actually looking for an apartment. It's for Caroline.

She's looking for a new apartment, and she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, and I'm thinking about it.

Cool! Cool, cool, sounds like so much fun.

I'm really glad that's your reaction, because I thought you were going to tell me I was making a huge mistake.

Honestly, I didn't want to hear that.

Wouldn't do that, that'd be silly.

(Winston trilling)

(cawing)

What are you doing? Huh? What?

No, Nick... No, no, no! No!

Nick. Nick. Nick, Nick! Nick! Don't!

It's for your own good.

Get out of there!

What are you...? No, Schmidt!

Grab him! Okay, grab him.

You got him?

Watch the television.

You got him?

Watch it. Watch it.

Watch the television. Watch the TV...

All right, all right, watch the TV.

Hello, Nick... NICK: No!

In all its glory, watch it.

You magnificent dumb-ass.

Come on.

If you're watching this, it's because you decided to get back with Caroline.

Yes, Nick. I did.

Well, congratulations, you idiot.

She destroyed you.

You don't know me, you jerk!

These, my dumb friend, are your tears.

And you saved them all.

I got him, I got him.

Think back, Nick, Stay still.

Or whatever they call you in your time.

Who dumped you three times?

Once before you had to speak at your brother's wedding.

Well, he's divorced now, so I'll get another sh*t.

This is a poem you wrote about Caroline...

I don't want the poem.

I don't want the poem.

You're getting the poem.

...But you're too emotional to read it right now.

You're going to give it to Schmidt for safekeeping.

This is your doing, Caroline.

You were right to have trusted me.

Two years I held this thing.

Read it.

(sobbing): Here they come.

NICK:

Okay.

"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

No, a summer's day is not a bitch."

(Nick whimpers on video)

Really, Nick?

That's how you want to talk about Caroline?

I can't move, my earring is stuck.

But there's something I want to do to you, then.

Don't move, don't move. Don't move, Nick, don't move!

Let's have a conversation like men! Let's act like men, Nick! Ah!

You want to act like men, let's act like men.

Look at how far you've come, Nick.

Want to be a bartender forever, pal?

I'm still a bartender.

You want to be a grown man who dresses like an unsponsored professional skateboarder?

You don't want to live like this. You're moving on.

I'm here to tell you you're doing the right thing, so just keep going.

Can I talk to you Nick-to-Nick for a second?

I respect you, man. You're rocking the hell out of that beard, and the long hair looks good, despite what other people are gonna say.

Look, the Caroline that broke your heart, I get why you don't like her.

But it's a different Caroline that's picking me up

(groans)

in five minutes, Nick.

Do you want me to live alone in this loft for the rest of my life?

Hey, what's the difference between me and Bill Cosby?

Well, thanks, guys. You helped me figure something out.

NICK (on video):

All right, well, look, I think this was a really nice talk, Future Nick.

I hope you got something from it, 'cause I know that I did.

(crying):

I'm gonna call her.

I have to call..

No! Damn it, give me the phone.

Please get out of here, I have to call... Coach! He's calling her again.

We lost him.

We sure did, Captain Black Sparrow.

Hey, Paul.

Hey.

I'm not going to let you lie to your girlfriend.

Okay? It's not fair to her.

So you have to tell her what happened between us.

Or I will.

All right. You're right.

I have to tell her.

Yeah.

I'm so scared, though. I don't want to lose her, Jess.

She's my soul mate.

For someone with a soul mate, you sure did have sex with me.

I know. I know, and I don't expect you to believe me ...

I wouldn't believe me if I were you ...

but check it out.

I even bought her an engagement ring.

(sighs)

Oh...

That's... that's really beautiful.

I've been carrying it around in my pocket for two weeks, trying to find the right way to propose to her.

And I just started panicking, and I got...

I don't know, I got scared, and-and-and really confused, and I'm so sorry to drag you into this, but this was the biggest mistake of my life.

God, Paul, don't make me feel sorry for you.

I know. I messed up.

Big-time.

And I'm going to lose her.

Oh, God, I can't lose her!

Hey, babe, you left your tuner in my car.

Oh. Hi! You're Jess, right?

I'm Jenn.

Jenn.

Well, I was just leaving.

Jess and I slept together.

Oh, God.

What? - I want to be completely honest with you.

It happened two days ago, and we did lots of stuff.

There was talking, and there were hands, and I think we ruined a throw pillow.

He's making it sound a lot more erotic than it was.

It was just, like, lying there and... blah.

I am so sorry.

I'm... I'm begging you to forgive me.

(crying):

I thought you loved me.

I'm so sorry.

(crying):

I'm an idiot!

(sniffles)

I'm an idiot, I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God. No...

Yeah, I'm such an idiot.

(sobbing)

Good-bye, Paul.

Oh, no. Wait. Wait. Jenn?

Haven't you done enough?

Yeah, I have. I have done enough, but...

I know how you feel.

I've been there. I've been cheated on before, and it feels like someone dropped an anvil on your heart.

Um, but...

That guy wasn't right for me.

You guys...

You guys are perfect together.

I thought you were Asian me, but now I realize I'm just Caucasian you.

What?

What?

Paul was scared.

And when you're scared, you do stupid things.

He made a really terrible mistake.

Really terrible.

The things that we did

48 hours ago were so dark...

I'm handling this.

Sorry.

Jenn...

you love Paul.

I know that because you're still standing here.

What you guys have...

it's way bigger than me.

And I think...

I think Paul has something to ask you.

I know this is not the right time to do this, in fact, this is a terrible time to do this, but I don't care.

I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Jennifer Ruth Toyogi.

I know that now more than ever.

Now that you slept with her.

Happy to help. Uh-huh.

If... if you still love me, at all...

Of course I still do. I...

(sighs)

Oh, yeah.

Um...

Ooh...

Will you... will you...

will you, will you marry him?

(whispers):

Yeah.

Is that a "yes"?

Yes.

(boy playing

"Bridal Chorus")

So you and Cece are staying away from each other.

Only until my penis stops looking like a knotted wizard's staff.

That sounds tough, man.

Guys like us ...

Nick, too ... we're warriors.

We just keep on fighting, and holding on, even when we know we're just making a big mistake.

Like Nick and Caroline.

And that earring.

I'm not giving this thing up.

You look like you were caught by a fly fisherman.

Dude, I've had it with the earring jokes.

You look like you should be standing in line to get into Shaquille O'Neal's birthday party.

Oh, my God, you guys.

The most exciting thing just happened.

I helped Paul propose to his girlfriend. They are engaged.

Awesome. - I feel like you're leaving out part of that story.

Where's Nick? I want to tell him.

This should be fun. Um...

yeah, Nick has something to tell you, too.

He's in the bathroom.

Oh, great.

Really?

She's gonna find out anyway.

(water running)

Nick! Nick!

Hey.

What, Jess?

Um, Paul proposed to his girlfriend in front of me.

That sounds pretty awkward.

She said yes, and it was... it was really...

it was really beautiful.

And it made me realize something.

You're wrong. All the stuff you said about Caroline, being about timing, and it just making sense?

No.

Because if you really love someone, it's simple.

Okay. Well, I understand what you're saying, but...

You deserve something amazing.

And... you deserve love.

I know you don't want to be alone, but I'm going to be there, and I'll tell that Tom Waits voice in your head to shut up.

(Tom Waits voice):

We don't have to settle...

Nick.

You're the best.

I'm moving in with Caroline.

We signed a lease this morning.

Thanks for saying all that stuff.

Now that I got your attention, Future Nick, there's a few things I'd like to talk to you about.

Be nicer to your mom when she calls.

Stop giving yourself high fives.

Put your head underwater, you two-year-old.

Be nicer to Coach, or he's gonna take off, live with a bunch of other white people.

(bad accent):

I no fake karate.

I'm Nick, I'm grumpy.

I'm going to put my baby hood on.

Sex is a sprint, not a marathon.

âª You are special, you are special âª
âª You... âª

We'll see each other in the future...

unless I see you first. Nick Miller!

Thank you guys for joining me on this momentous day.

As you guys know, it's been kind of a rough year for me.

I got dumped by Caroline, then Julia.

I opened myself up to love, I was hurt badly, and I closed myself up again.

The downstairs neighbor put a password on their Wi-Fi...

Off topic. Off-putting.

Okay. I agree.

So I've decided...

to give up on women, and put all that energy into...

tomatoes!

You know what? It was on us for thinking this wasn't gonna be stupid.

Thank God! I thought he was trying to sell us something.

Guys, I have a whole speech!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you guys.

I told him not to lead with tomatoes, but he did.

As his friends, don't you want to know why he wants to plant tomatoes?

Is it because he wants tomatoes?

This is my feeble attempt at a new beginning.

He's sowing the seeds for a more fruitful tomorrow.

He is turning over a new leaf. He is...

Jess, please don't do plant metaphors right now.

Okay, I'll trim it back a little bit.

Okay, but you did it again.

It's just ripe with plant metaphors.

Okay, but stop.

I'm looking at you guys, and I'm realizing that there's a possibility of happiness.

He's looking for a little dapple of sunlight.

Go.

Sorry.

Winston and Shelby, you guys have obviously found love, so...

No, you have no idea.

No, I do, 'cause you talk about it all the time.

I think we all have a pretty good idea.

Pretty clear idea.

Schmidt and Cece, you almost made a baby together.

You almost made a person. Think about that!

Jess...

you're dating the man that I could see myself growing old with.

Russell, you got a great-looking face.

Your jawline could cut glass.

Hold on tight, sister.

Don't let that one slip away.

It's getting a little weird, Nick.

So, without further ado...

Water, the source of life.

Whoa!

(everyone groaning, grumbling

(everyone groaning, grumbling It's okay, I got two of them.

You know what?

Go downstairs, if you want!

I don't care!

I got the tomatoes and I'm bettin' on me!

Freeze frame!

When I'm up in the air and the legs are there.

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

Cece, the Jewish is here to make sex.

Uh, it's actually Schmidt.

Um, we've met, uh, many times.

Right. I hear you make sex through Cece wall.

You sound like dog being stepped on.

Any noises I make, they come from a very truthful place.

I like to create a free environment in the sack.

Hey.

What's going on here?

I like his face.

I want to punch, punch, punch!

Beautiful women...

you guys can say just about anything, can't you?

So what are you doing here? So, look, we've barely spoken since I almost impregnated you.

You know, it's just, it's this whole thing has just kind of got me thinking.

Maybe this is just too intense, and we should stop.

That's what you want?

It's how I feel right now, so, yeah.

Oh... Coolio.

So he goes out with me.

Oh, Nadia, I think that...

I think that's a great idea.

I mean, that's what you want, right?

Yeah. It's great. Totally cool with me.

Yay! We have fun.

I make him put on black shawl, pretend he's grandma.

Fine, twist my arm.

I'll go out with the hot Russian model whose ancestors probably b*rned down my ancestors' village.

Something weird happened to me today.

I was at Russell's gym, and I ran into his ex-wife Ouli.

Jess, hi!

Ouli!

Oh, that's a great swimsuit.

Thank you.

Wow, someone's been working out.

You back's like a bag of ropes.

Oh, mama.

It was really foggy and I kept making eye contact with her nipples, and then I panicked and I invited her to dinner with Russell and me tonight.

What?

You did what?!

It's just that, like, Ouli is like this looming presence, and we don't talk about it, and I don't know, I thought it would be, like, good for us.

Everything okay with Russell?

Everything's fine.

I know it's gonna be tense at first,

'cause Ouli's no Russell's favorite person, but I grew up with divorced parents, and I'm really good at navigating these situations.

What did I do?

Nothing!

âª Mommy's all right âª
âª Daddy's all right âª
âª They just seem a little weird âª
âª Surrender, surrender... âª

Don't tap-dance at dinner.

Do you really think I would tap-dance at dinner?

Yes. I'm hiding your tap shoes, Jess.

Absolutely.

I'm with Schmidt. Don't do it.

Hi.

Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

Hi!

Hi!

Hey, remember last time we were hugging?

You were naked.

That was weird.

No!

No, that's not weird at all.

I have no problem being naked.

Hi.

Hi.

How are the "quethadillath"?

You know what? I've actually never had them.

Oh, the eye roll.

Mm. Miss that.

I didn't actually roll my eyes.

I just needed to quickly stare at the ceiling.

Hey, Ouli...

Mm...

I love your name.

Thank you.

Or should I say, "grathiath"?

Uh...

Oh.

Well, this is fun.

Yeah.

It is.

Should we get, like, eight more of these, right?

I love this song.

Oh, I hate this song.

When we were on vacation in Oaxaca, Ouli hummed this song for, like, an eight-hour drive.

Well, it wouldn't have been eight hours if you hadn't gotten lost.

At one point, we were just following some donkeys.

Oh, my gosh! Look, it's food!

I love food.

They were not donkeys!

I can't even remember what we were talking about.

It wasn't a road.

For the millionth time, just because a road's not on a map, doesn't mean it's not a road!

Inside voice.

You know what means it's not a road?

When there are guys in t*nk telling you to turn around.

Oh, come on! Those were two kids in a jeep!

Car gets stuck in the mud, and no, you could not move it, Oh, here it is.

Because, God forbid, you break a nail!

I got one manicure, one time!

I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this!

âª Ouli's all right, Russell's all right âª
âª They just seem a little weird âª
âª Surrender, surrender... âª

I'm leaving.

You mean before you get your "quethadillath"?

That's it.

It was crazy.

There was, like, serious heat between them.

Does she still have feelings for him?

Maybe...

Hey, Schmidt.

What up?

So, Nadia's excited for your date tonight.

I bet.

Make sure, uh, you use protection.

She's a foreigner, Cece.

What, do I look like an idiot?

Seriously, she doesn't even know where she's been, all right?

What, are we at Santa's family reunion?

'Cause the "clawses"

are coming out.

The-the "claws" are coming out? You know...

You're being catty, Cece.

Are you gonna let him go out with Nadia?

She was kicked out of Russia, Cece. Russia.

Come on, why don't you just tell him you like him?

It doesn't matter if I like him.

It's over.

And you're fine with that?

Yeah.

Are you?

Yeah.

Are you?

Yeah.

Hold up. Are you?

I am gonna k*ll you.

But are you?

Hey, Nick...

What?

Have you seen Shelby's cat Rummikub?

I mean, he is the cutest.

Just the absolute cutest.

All right, take a look at this picture where he woke up on my face.

Can't even see my face.

I look like a cat man.

No! No! Get out of here, birds!

Please get out of here, you sky rats!

Go back to Hell, where you belong!

Leave me and my plants alone!

I need this!

You know who loves birds?

Please don't say it, Winston.

Shelby.

So...

How do you like America?

I like salad bar.

I like Despicable Me.

Tosh 2.0.

I like Connect 4, freedom of speech, David Fincher, uh... sidewalk.

I like 1-800-SLIM.

"Your Mama" jokes.

Strawberry.

Wilmer Velmavelma.

Leon J. Panetta.

Ice skating for fun, not to save life.

What are you laughing at?

Cheese. Is for mouse.

Are you Mick Mouse?

Am I what?

Why don't you get in your spaceship like Mick Mouse?

What are you talking about?

Mick Mouse.

What is a Mick Mouse?

Mick Mouse!

I don't understand what Mick Mouse is!

Mick Mouse!

I don't under... I don't...

What does that mean? What's a Mick Mouse?

Mick Mouse!

Are you saying Mickey Mouse?

Yes.

In America, honey, okay, Mickey Mouse, he's earthbound.

Let's do sex party.

I sex you in face.

You're gonna sex me in my face?

Well, fancy meeting you here.

Hi.

What's up?

Love the gym.

You and Russell, huh?

Oh... God.

Last night?

Sorry.

If we made you feel uncomfortable.

We just can't be in the same room without wanting to rip each other's faces off.

Yeah... yeah.

Well, as long as it's, like, you know, faces and not, like... clothes.

You don't think...

No.

I'm just... it's my endorphins,

'cause I'm just, like, so high on endorphins.

Yeah, because there's not a chance in hell.

I mean, he is all yours.

All yours.

Awesome.

I mean, you know what it's like with Russell.

Yeah.

Yeah!

I mean... It's this roller coaster.

It's like standing on the bow of a catamaran blasted with spray during a perfect storm.

But you're...

naked and...

and you're on f*re.

You know?

Yeah. I do.

Whoo!

I'm just, like, "Russell, put away the passion."

And...

show me a moderately good time.

Yeah.

Crazy.

So crazy.

It's crazy.

Russell.

Hey!

What?

What's with all the hammering?

Whoa! What the hell is this thing?

This thing is creepy.

Yeah, it's called a scarecrow, okay?

Birds keep coming after my plants.

Whatever you're doing, just... stop with the hammering, okay?

Because me and Shelby are downstairs, right now, trying to make love.

Ugh! Did you honestly just say that?

Well, dude, we're making love, man. It's beautiful.

Who have you become, man?

I'm happy. Am I not allowed to be happy?

You're allowed to be happy, but it's really annoying, the way you're doing it.

You know what I don't care about?

Mm-hmm?

Shelby.

Oh, Shelby loves puzzles.

Oh, Shelby loves donuts, but hates donut holes.

Why are you hating on Shelby so much?

I used to be your Shelby!

That came out wrong.

I'm sorry, I didn't know it was my fault that your life sucks and you're so miserable.

Look at yourself! You look like one of those guys who crawls out of the grave in the "Thriller" video.

I want you to git.

Seriously?

I want you to git off my farm!

This is a little weird, man.

You used to be my best friend. Now, I don't know! - Talk to yourself, man.

So git!

I'm gitten!

I don't need ya!

Shut up!

Hey, Russell.

Mm-hmm.

Do I ever drive you crazy?

Of course not.

Come on. There has to be something that I do that just, like... gets under your skin.

No, I can't think of anything.

Come on, Russell. Think.

Think, think, think, think.

Thin-k.

That's annoying, right, the way I say, "Think"?

Well...

With a "K."

Okay, Jess, um...

Your eyes bug out a little when you're trying to make a point.

Yeah?

Yeah. And you do this, uh, squatting thing when you're thinking sometimes.

Yeah?

Yeah. Don't love that.

Like that? Like that?

Uh...

Yeah, and I've never actually seen both of those things together, so it's not a favorite of mine.

Is this just driving you crazy?

Um...

No, but it's not pleasant.

You're not pleasant.

You're not pleasant.

That's not nice, that's-that's...

Yeah.

Not nice.

No, it's passion!

Oh! You hurt my teeth.

Yeah, what you gonna do about it, Russell?

Uh, well, I mean, probably nothing.

You know, I hate this shirt, I hate this shirt.

Okay. Okay, you know, well could you please... thank you.

There it is. There's the f*re.

Where you been hiding it, Rusty? Where you been hiding it?

I'm gonna, um, make some tea.

Do you want some tea? We have chamomile.

No!

Okay. I mean...

oolong... oolong, you want oolong?

Ugh, I hate that you have so many coasters! Why?

Well, it's actually kind of a funny story... - Yeah?

Wow. - You just coasting through life, you coaster? - This isn't good, not at all. What are you...

You know, now-now I'm pissed. What is this?

Something's missing.

I didn't know it until I saw you and Ouli together the other night almost strangle each other.

But then it clicked.

I want that.

I want what you and Ouli have.

You want me to treat you like my ex-wife?

Who I hate?

I don't know, I just...

You guys have this spark, and I want that spark!

You have to admit, you have this spark, this passion.

Passion's overrated, Jess.

I knew we shouldn't have gone to that dinner, I...

I want to go home.

Jess... Just... can you just take me home?


Get in there!

Useless.

You... get... in there.

What is this, Martin Scorsese's

The Wizard of Oz?

I'm sorry about what happened on the roof, man.

Apology accepted.

It's just... we used to be miserable together, man.

We did have some pretty bad times together.

Had the worst.

Hey, remember that time we pooled our money and bought that online dating profile together?

Yes.

The ladies did not care for Ninston Biller.

Zero dates.

Zero.

I'm sorry that I can't be happier for you.

I don't really know what's wrong with me, Winston.

You want me to tell you?

Not really, actually.

Okay, why are you giving up?

If something doesn't work out, what do you do?

You make an adjustment, you give it one more sh*t.

I mean, that's what I did with...

Okay, just say it.

...My beautiful Shelby.

Shelby.

See, why did you say,

"my beautiful Shelby"?

It's so weird.

Look, man, I just called her out of the blue, okay?

And then... I was a different person, and she was a different person. Now look at us, man.

We're eating sandwiches and making love to one another.

Sandwiches and sex?

I want that.

Hey.

How, um... how was your date last night?

Brief. Small man go to hospital.

The hospital?

Is he okay?

I don't know.

I leave him there, I go make bowling.

Nadia... like, honestly, what did you do to him?

Well, he cry and cry. It was so funny.

Oh, my God.

There's me!

I really like what we have. I thought you did, too.

I do. I did. It's just, Russell...

Great. Just forget it.

Yeah, that seems to happen every time you're in this car.

But there's so many buttons. It's like...

The Batmobile doesn't have so many buttons.

Look, Jess, I've already done the crazy, expl*sive passion thing.

When I was with Ouli, it was like edging closer and closer to a wood chipper.

I'm not looking for that any more.

I understand.

But I am.

And...

I want passion...

even if it's harder and hurts more.

So that's it.

Good-bye, Russell.

Well...

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Are you serious?

How do you look this good under fluorescent lights?

I am so, so sorry.

Okay? This is all my fault. I thought...

What happened?

Yeah, um... this is embarrassing.

I broke my penis.

You what?

I broke my penis.

Things got... I mean, just out of control with Nadia last night.

And there was like this one moment where it was just blinding pain.

And then there was another moment where I was like watching myself watch myself...

I think I finally understand what The Tree of Life is about.

And I can't be certain of this, but I'm almost positive that Nadia's vag*na contains a right angle.

I'm leaving. I cannot believe I came here.

How are you upset right now?

Cece, you ended this.

I don't know what you want from me!

I don't want you sleeping with Nadia.

Are you crazy? I don't want you sleeping with anyone.

Because I like you.

I can't just always say what I feel, okay?

It's just...

Just, whatever, Schmidt.

You like me.

You like my personality?

I was surprised, too.

Come here.

Oh!

Oh!

What happened?

Oh, my God, why?

Oh, what?

Oh, my God, my penis is having a heart att*ck.

Don't touch me, don't touch me.

Okay. I...

You gotta get out of here.

All right.

I mean, I'd-I'd like... don't bend over!

For crying out loud! What are you, nuts?

I'm sorry, it's the yoga pants.

I'm sorry for this, but I...

I like you.

And I like you, too, so much.

Call a nurse, call a male nurse.

Probably a heavy-set male nurse would be nice.

Bye.

Describe it to them as like a... as a battered highway cone.

Oh, hey.

Hey...

Caroline, how you doing?

Good.

Just... going to use the bathroom.

âª For sentimental reasons... âª

Caroline?

Yeah, I know.

I just called her, and then... I don't know, it's...

What are you doing? You guys had such a terrible relationship.

Are you crazy?

Are you burning incense?

Yes, I am, for ambiance. She digs it.

She digs it?

Are you kidding, Nick? What happened?

What happened to swearing off women and focusing on tomatoes?

I can't grow tomatoes, Jess.

I think this is what was supposed to happen all along.

Me and Caroline. And I'm okay with it.

I'm happy.

That is pathetic, Nick. You're just saying that

'cause you don't have the patience or the courage to be alone.

I will never get used to those urinals.

Hey, would you give me a second? I have to talk to Jess for...

Oh. Sure.

Great.

Okay.

Bye, Caroline.

Bye.

See you in one second. What is your problem?

Have fun making terrible life decisions!

Oh, you just know everything, don't you?

No, I don't...

I'm actually so sick of you.

I'm just really disappointed in you.

You know, maybe I'll be more like you, Jess, and I'll go run into the kitchen and make pastries with sprinklies on them, That isn't what I do.

Then throw some dumb pajama outfit on, and then tell other people how to live their lives!

It's not a pajama outfit!

They're called pajamas!

That's what I said!

Nick, why don't you go back in your room and put on your stupid flannel and keep not living up to your potential!

You're a crazy person, Jess!

I am not, I'm just saying things that you don't want to hear.

You know what I would like to hear from you?

What?

Silence!

Well, I'm not gonna be silenced!

Just shut up! For one second be quiet!

I'm trying to help you!

Please be quiet!

No! No!

I don't want your help.

Stop making that face at me. I hate that face.

This is my only face! I don't have a lot of faces, and if you don't like looking at my face, Jess...then look at my ass!

Oh!

Yeah! Get a good look!

Stop shaking your ass at me, you quitter.

This is the ass of a failure.

You get a look.

Look right at my ass.

No, Nick.

You bought the ticket, take a ride.

Feast your eyes on my butt.

I'm winning this moment.

You quitter. - Look at my butt, it's going faster than yours!

I have the fastest butt in the land.

I got a faster one!

No, you don't.

What are we doing?

Stop looking at my ass.

Oh, I'm gonna k*ll you.

Quitter!

You really think Nick is gonna believe that a tomato just sprung up overnight?

Yes, I do.

When it comes to tomatoes, no one in the world knows less than Nick.

So how long you gotta ice that thing?

Eight weeks.

I mean, if I have any excitement it's excruciating pain.

Boobies.

What?

Boobies.

I love boobies...

Girls with clean hair. - Winston, this is the least funny game we've ever played.

Models eating sliders.

Bernadette Peters on a high beam.

Freshly baked bread.

Oh God.

But you're using birth control, right?

Yeah, of course.

It's just that Schmidt gets so athletic that birth control becomes like one of those plastic barbecue covers in a hurricane.

I didn't want to know that.

Okay, the pregnancy test doesn't work until after six days, so just get through the weekend and don't tell Schmidt until you're sure.

Yeah, no, of course not, of course.

It's just...

I can't stop thinking about what a Schmidt baby would be like.

Just, I mean, I, I don't know.

Would it just want to nurse 24 hours a day?

Probably.

We could make it, like, a douche baby jar.

(chuckles)

(gasps)

Oh, my God.

SCHMIDT:

Ladies, ladies, what is all the screaming about?

Oh, my... Jess, have you finally agreed to be our third?

Because, you know, we've discussed this.

We have never talked about that, Schmidt.

What? Schmidt, this is not the time.

Schmidt, we were just thinking about what you might have been like as a baby.

Oh, I was the b*mb diggity as a baby.

I mean, I was, I was, like, break-dancing at eight months old.

But they say that I needed a magnum size diaper.

Oh, my God.

Get out. Seriously?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

All right, what's with the suit?

And if you say swing dancing, I'm gonna slap your face.

Well, my boss is going to be on TV today...

Michael Strahan's new talk show On the Strahan Narrow.

Great show.

He's got too many DUls to drive himself, so I guess I got to take him.

JESS:

Sit in my room, Schmidt.

Cece's resting.

Hey, guys, um, listen up.

Uh, Sarah is going to be here in a few minutes, so best behavior.

Who's Sarah? Russell's daughter, so no F-b*mb, P-b*mb.

Actually, no "B" through "S"

b*mb, no b*mb, and no bringing home college girls, Berlusconi.

(chuckles) Hey, that's not fair.

The girl I've been hanging out with is totally mature and interesting.

Please put on some pants.

Everything you say sounds really creepy when you're not wearing pants.

Your hair looks nice.

BOTH: Ugh.

Mmm, this coffee is smoldering.

So creepy.

So what's with the babysitting?

I think he's actually testing me.

I think he's seeing if I can be a mom.

Are you nervous?

It's nothing I can't handle.

I'm halfway there... I'm already her teacher, so...

(phone chirps)

Oh, she's here.

Um, Nick, uh, put on some pants or at least some really high socks.

High socks it is.

Hi, Ms. Day.

Hi, Sarah.

I can be here in under five minutes if I need to be.

(sighs)

Honestly I wouldn't have agreed to this, except my husband is out of town, and you're Sarah's favorite teacher and my husband's favorite teacher.

(chuckles)

Um, hey, um, I hope this doesn't sound rude, but, um, you keep saying

"husband"

and I just want to make sure you and Russell...

you're not still married?

(laughing):

Oh... no, no.

(both laughing)

'Cause I just, like, wanted to make sure there wasn't some very important piece of information that I totally missed.

No, I mean, but he'll always be my husband, if you know what I mean.

Yeah.

Actually, could you explain what you mean very clearly?

Cece's acting really weird.

Do you think she's getting tired of me?

I mean, look, it's been, like, months of non-stop sex.

I mean, what can I do if she doesn't let me h*t the fifth chakra?

I'm not listening to you.

I'm just, I'm just saying, look, do you think she wants something more than sex? (phone ringing)

Do you think she's finally becoming a girl?

'Cause I can't handle that, man.

Hey, boss. What are you doing?

Hmm?

Look...

W-W-Wait, n-n-no, yesterday you said noon, but it's only 10:30.

Do you think that I've become too dependent on a hot lava massage?

Hmm?

I'm gonna be there in just a second.

What about costumes?

I got to go, bye.

Do you think I made her dress up too much?

Look, man, I'm not going to sit here and bond with you about this, all right?

I got to go babysit my boss.

JESS: Hey, Schmidt, you gonna stay for dinner?

We're going to borrow your pasta maker.

Oh, that's great, are you gonna teach Sarah your recipe for overcooked mush?

JESS: Ha, ha, no, I'm teaching her about Italy.

NICK: I'm coming with a date...

Chloe. Uh, no, you're not.

You are not bringing any of those girls around Sarah.

Hey, you must be Sarah.

And you guys are wrong about Chloe. Okay, Chloe is smart and she's mature and she knows about art and famous artists like Banksy and the guy who did the Obama poster and, you know, like, Chalk Outline Guy.

That's stupid.

Your eyes are so brown.

They look like poop.

Be honest with me... do my eyes look like poo?

There's a bit of a, a poopy-ish hue.

Old poo eyes.

(Sarah laughs)

(sighs)

Oh, hey.

I like your house.

It's not my house!

Go, go!

What?

(speaking Cambodian)

Go!

(tires screeching)

(yelling in Cambodian)

What's going on?

What are you talking about, man?

I'm sweating spicy ban hoaw, wearing a Cambodian woman's shoes.

What do you think is going on? I don't know, I'm just trying to give you an opportunity to lie to me, Joe, just trying to be polite.

Actually, the ancient Egyptians made pasta by flattening the dough with their feet.

Cool, huh?

Sarah?

Hey.

(chuckles)

Why do you have so many bras?

You're a teacher.

Teachers need bras, too.

You know, like, all that erasing and stuff.

It's like...

That's an after-

school bra.

Can I get out of doing homework because you're dating my dad?

No.

Um, hey, I know having your teacher dating your dad is weird, um, but I just want you to know that, um, you can ask me anything.

Really?

Yeah, anything.

Are you in love with my dad?

Hmm... oh...

Do you and my dad ever dry-lump?

G... uh...

Is sexting cool?

What? No, it's not cool.

Have you done a 99?

I think that's a tax form.

Have you ever given anyone plow jobs?

I don't know.

How do you make love to a person animal-style?

Do you want to learn how to play bridge?

SCHMIDT:

I've been doing some thinking, and

I think it's time that I take you on a real date.

You're asking me out on a date?

Yeah, it'll be our first real date.

Now, Italy on Ice is a celebration of all things Italian featuring ice dancing's biggest and brightest Italian stars.

Drea de Matteo is scheduled to appear, but, you know, they're not liable if she doesn't.

I can't go right now.

It's a really bad time, okay?

I'm sorry, just take someone else.

You mean, like another girl?

Yeah, Schmidt, that's what this is.

That's the deal.

Just take someone else, okay?

All right, yeah, sure, yeah, I'll just...

I'll ask somebody else, I'll just... yeah, totally, and with these VIP tickets I got... poppacorno.

What?

Poppacorno.

Poppacorno.

It's "popcorn"

in Italian.

I don't think you should be rushing into these things.

You need to look for a partner who is...

Ew, you said "partner."

I know, that sucked.

I'm sorry.

Look, as your friend Jess, not Ms. Day, just choose someone who makes you laugh.

Like Nick?

Yeah, I mean... wait, what?

Oh, my God, oh, my God, I love Nick so, so, so much.

He's so hot.

That Nick?

I want to rub my face on his face.

(moans)

Just to be clear, I am dialing another woman to go see Italy on Ice right now.

CECE:

That's fine, do it.

Hey, guys, not now.

Oh, it's ringing.

Don't care.

This room cannot take any more hormones.

I love the juxtaposition of high-brow literary with low-brow youth culture.

It's almost too much juxtaposition for me.

You know what I mean?

It's, like, right up to the line of juxtaposition, but I think I'm gonna let it slide.

(ringtone playing)

Hey, I got to... yes.

You've got Nick.

Hey, Nick-ole.

What it be, girl?

What's going on, Schmidt?

What you got going on, ma?

It's the freakin' weekend.

Did you just call me "girl"?

Are you wearing something sexy?

Just, you know, button-down and jeans like always.

Oh, you got jeans on, baby, are they tight?

Hmm, they're a little loose;

I buy 'em big.

Oh, them jeans sound sexy.

Everything all right? You want to hang out more, Schmidt?

You taking care of that tushy... taking care of that tushy for me?

I'm not doing, like, squats or anything.

I'm trying to eat less doughnuts.

You still keeping it tight?

You're an idiot.

What?

I thought this is what you wanted.

JESS: This is a really good example of people who should not be making love.

Have fun.

Cece, are you okay?

Damn it!

SARAH: You don't understand... I love Nick so, so, so much.

He's so hot, I'm going to die.

Sarah, Nick is way too old for you.

I live with him.

He is dirty and weird.

No, no, no, no...

Sarah, not Nick's room.

It's not well ventilated in there.

Let's see, we'll get there a little early, maybe get you in the shower, maybe a once-over with some disinfectant.

Hmm... hey.

Yard sale... pull over.

(chuckles)

No.

Someone rich d*ed, I can smell it.

Okay, look, Joe, I'm trying to get you to the show on time.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

I'll push you out of the car, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh, yeah, yeah, baby, yard sale, yeah.

Oh, I feel so alive.

Aah, I got a charley horse.

Oh, God.

Hey, Sarah.

Can you come out of Nick's room?

I'm going to roll in his dirty clothes.

Jess, Schmidt asked me out.

Oh.

Like, he came over and he asked me out, and I really can't go on a date with him right now.

Okay...

(Cece and Sarah talking)

Sarah! I've had enough of this little...

Shh! - Listen to me, listen to me, all right, you little brat, you just need to be quiet because I need my friend to focus on me right now!

(whispering):

What are you doing, Cece?

You know how much this means to me.

Don't let your dysfunction rub off on her.

I am going to be a terrible mother.

No, no, no, shh.

A terrible mom!

I'm gonna be just like my mother.

You're gonna be a great mom.

You're gonna be a fashionable mom.

I can make this right, okay?

Just...

Sarah?

Hey, Sarah.

Um, look, you should definitely not be having sex right now at this age, but when you do, just make sure you always use protection because, even if he says it's tantric and you're Indian and you know better, you're just going to end up pregnant anyways.

SCHMIDT:

What?

Cece, are you pregnant?

SARAH: Whoa!

Sarah, Nick has one tie.

See if you can find it.

CECE: No, okay, I don't know.

We have to wait for the test results, but I'm late.

Oh, my...

We made a caramel miracle.

(laughing):

You pregnant, you pregnant.

Oh, my God.

You got Cece pregnant?

We used protection. I don't know how this happened.

Think she did it on purpose?

An Indian-Jewish baby... who wouldn't want that? Think about the bone structure.

Okay, I'm not ready to be a godparent.

Don't ask.

No one's asking you.

Phew, good.

I'm not into being an uncle.

You're not my brother!


Okay, Schmidt, are you sure you're okay about this?

'Cause I'm freaking out by the fact that you're not freaking out!

Yeah, I'm oddly calm about the whole thing.

Look, Nick, maybe this isn't exactly in my five-year plan, but maybe this is fate.

You know, maybe I h*t the jackpot.

Maybe this is the universe telling me that I'm never gonna find a girl better than Cece.

By, the way, I'm-I'm Schmidt.

Chloe. Mazel tov on your news.

Oh, my God, finally, Nicholas.

You bring home a nice girl.

Right?

So... that was crazy what happened with my friends, right?

I liked it.

Your life's like

Gossip Girl,

only everyone is old and poor.

You know, there actually was a show like that.

It was called Golden Girls.

I'm Betty White, Schmidt's Rue McClanahan...

Don't you think Nick is hot?

Nick? Um... yeah, in a rumpled, small-town P.I. kind of way.

What's he like in the morning?

Do his eyes get sleepy?

Does he love stuff?

I want to love what he loves.

Do you think that we'll ever do animal style?

Four minutes! We eat in four!

I made you a mocktail.

Cece, are you crying?

No. No. (sniffles)

No. I-I... I just... I don't... I don't know.

You're an amazing woman, and you're going to do and be so many things in this life.

Maybe you'll be a mom, and maybe... maybe not.

But I will support you no matter what.

Thank you.

I also just want to give you a quick heads up.

I'm probably going to be going on the internet before we have sex again, because I-I just... I don't want to impregnate the baby, you know?

I mean, we could have a Russian nesting doll situation on our hands.

(loud munching, fork scrapes plate)

So, Sarah and I learned to use the pasta maker today, which was cool.

Are you and Nick making love?

Hmm?

Who wants seconds? That's my question.

Yeah, I would love seconds, Jess. That'd be great.

If you're a boy, I'm gonna...

I'm gonna name you Mordecai, or Abraham, Menachem Menandel, Schmerson.

Hey! I'm watching you.

Well, time for dessert.

No, please don't get up. I will take care of it.

Oh, thank you. That's so thoughtful.

See? Thoughtful and mature.

In your face! Yes!

Congratulations. You're dating a girl with basic table manners.

You win. Why don't you get on her health care plan?

(bl*wing raspberries)

SCHMIDT:

I'm so excited to take this journey with you.

I mean, your boobs are gonna be unbelievably enormous.

JESS:

Sarah, do you want to go help Chloe with the dessert? I hate her.

Oh, come on, you don't hate her.

You don't know her well enough to hate her.

Yes, I do! I know her.

She used to ride on my school bus.

No, no, no, that's...

What?

Oh, my God, that's why you look so familiar!

You were that crazy little kindergartner who had, like, the imaginary friends.

Oh.

You're the skank with the skank face.

Sarah, I know you're trying to look cool in front of you you know who...

What?! You told him?!

No! I did not tell him.

You just told him!

Oh, my God, Jess!

(door slams, Jess sighs)

What are you saying?

When was the last time you were on a school bus?

Last year.

How old are you?

18.

(groaning)

JESS:

Hey, you know what, Chloe?

I actually think I subbed for your eighth grade English class.

That's right! Hi, Miss Day!

Hi.

(Nick groans)

Well, it's a good thing I got you an extra shirt, 'cause...

(grunts)

Whoa! Joe, Joe!

Where you going? Where you going? Wait.

Where are you going? Uh, sorry about this, man.

Hey, don't make me chase you! Do not make me chase you!

Joe, come back.

(coughs)

(thudding)

(grunts)

Oh! Are you okay?

Leave me alone.

So, come on, man. What's up?

Michael Strahan makes me feel like an idiot.

Okay? I mean, he thinks he's better than me.

He wins the Super Bowl, and suddenly, he's the best at everything.

What's he better than you at? Huh?

Marriage, probably. Money management, I would say.

Probably he's better than you at that.

Well...

He's not better than you at yard sales.

He's good at yard sales.

Yeah, but he's not better than you.

So here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna walk into that studio, and you're gonna show him the Napoli that I saw today.

The one that I saw grabbed seven copies of Speed on VHS at a yard sale for a fraction of the retail price.

When's the last time Strahan did that?

Boom. You're not gonna let him win.

Yeah. You know, I'm gonna do it.

I'm gonna do it.

You're gonna do it?

That guy's a b-hole. He's a b-hole!

You know what? If you were a woman, or even dressed as a woman, man, we'd be unstoppable.

Mm, mm.

18 years old. She was 18 years old.

She doesn't even know what Netscape is.

Thinks of Ice Cube as mainly an actor.

This is a disaster! Ouli's downstairs.

She just called me. She wants to be let up.

Sarah's in my room, because she fell in love with you for some unknown reason.

I might as well call you

Bridge to Terabithia,

because you make children cry.

And you... I might as well call you

Indian In the Cupboard because you put an Indian in Ce... Never mind.

I will not apologize for my powerful sperm.

Why are young girls in love with me? I look like an old man.

Shut up, both of you!

We're gonna fix this, 'cause I'm not losing Russell because you two have to make and/or date babies.

You... go stall Ouli.

Try not to get her pregnant.

You... come with me and get Sarah out of my room. Now!

I gonna go do Ouli.

Yeah, I'm gonna go do this.

Yeah. All right.

Ouli?

Yeah.

Oh, my God, it's-it's Schmidt.

How are you?

Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.

Great.

Yeah. Havasu.

'99. I was on the boat, remember?

No.

We were just... We were part... Yeah. I...

Winter Olympics. Uh-huh.

No.

2006.

Bobsled.

Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better.

SARAH:

No! No, I never will.

I can be a bit of an anchor.

I've been known to drag women down.

That is true.

(whispers): Save me.

What? This is so entertaining.

Okay, Jess, honestly, help me.

I don't know what to do. All right.

Okay, just tell her something about life or something.

Hey, Sarah?

Sarah, I haven't loved somebody the way you love me in a very long time, and I miss that feeling.

The feeling you have is good. It's just misplaced.

It's better than being numb your whole life.

You end up doing such weird things.

You know what? Just stay in there.

It's not that great out here.

Stay in there as long as you can.

He's kidding, Sarah.

You should definitely, definitely come out.

Oh, my God. The Melman funeral?

No. - We were both sitting next to...

to Un... Un-Uncle Jack?

Yeah, sure.

I don't know Uncle Jack or Mel...

Oh, my... I used to do your hair in Tribeca.

Sarah? Sarah, please come out.

Sarah, please.

I can't come out. I'm too embarrassed.

In front of us? We are literally the most embarrassing people on the planet.

Trust me. - Yeah, you don't have to be embarrassed around us.

Sometimes I talk louder to blind people.

I'm 30 years old, and I've peed in every pool I've been into.

Every single one.

Ew.

I originally grew these bangs

'cause I hate my forehead.

I still think it's funny when I guy puts tennis b*lls under his shirt and pretends it's boobs.

(muffled laugh)

They look like little boobs.

I know.

Come on, Sarah!

Look, I do so many stupid things.

You don't even know.

I mean, like, falling for your dad.

That was... so crazy, and I understand why you're confused.

I'm confused.

SARAH:

I'm not confused. I'm stuck.

What? Oh, my God.

Oh. I don't know how to get them off.

Okay. Oh, okay. I'll get the front.

I'll get the back.

Hey, hey, guys, she's coming.

Ouli's coming. I failed.

I failed. I'm sorry. Uh...

Hi, Ouli. Um...

Who is the man taking the bras off my daughter?

There is a God! I've got my period!

It's so amazing! Oh, my God.

Mmm. I got my period.

(Cece laughs)

She got her period.

So happy!

Welcome to our home. Would you like a drink?

You have a beautiful daughter and a beautiful ex-husband.

I mean...

Bye, Nick.

I'm kind of over you now.

Okay.

(Sarah sighs)

Thank you. - Thanks, Jess. I had a really great time.

Thanks, Sarah. Good-bye.

(whispering): Your mom doesn't have to know everything.

Heard that. Let's go.

Okay.

Thanks for coming by.

Oh, sure.

Bye, Sarah. See you at school.

Bye.

Bye, Ouli. You ruley.

Bye, Jess. You're a mess.

I'm not having kids... till I'm 80.

Now we can just go back to the way things were.

You can go on your date.

Right. Nicole, mm-hmm.

No more stupid mistakes, right?

Right.

(laughs)

I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

Go do your thing.

Yeah.

Oh, wait. Oh, okay.

Okay, Cece, let's just...

Yeah.

You know, there's a marathon downtown, and I don't want you to h*t the traffic. - Okay.

Okay. Thank you.

So let's just, head down.

That's very thought of you.

Don't h*t the top.

Okay. All right, you in, you in, you in? Good, okay.

Terrible car for a baby anyway.

(sighs)

(sighs)

Oh.

I never knew Italy was so much more than pizza, Schmidty.

It's so much more.

She's okay. You're awesome!

The reenactment of Pompeii really stays with you.

What a move!

Two shows a day. Two shows a day! How do they do it?

Hey, if you're play a gondolier, you better skate

like a gondolier.

You know, Schmidty? Here's this idea.

We should buy skaters.

Yeah!

(cheering)

Do something weird, Mussolini. We love you.

JESS: I love these parties.

I feel like I'm an ambassador, or a spy, or, like, a really high-class prost*tute.

Well, Jess, it's a political fundraiser.

Who's to say you can't be all three?

Hey, this is... really good.

I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm really, um...

Happy.

Happy.

It's like the complete opposite of my marriage.

I'll give you the opposite of your marriage.

What?

Sorry, I just...

I've never heard you talk about your ex-wife, and I got really nervous and...

I tried to flirt information out of you.

Aw...

So...

I haven't been home in a week, and, um...

underneath my dress, I'm wearing...

a pair of your boxer briefs that I borrowed slash-stole slash-I'm not giving them back.

Come on. Let's go. Go to my house right now.

Well, I have to go to my home for a bit.

No, no, come on.

Come on. Stay with me.

No, I'm worried about the guys.

They must really be missing me and wondering where I am.

Hey! Sacrifice, sacrifice, Lava! Touched the lava!

...sacrifice...

Touched the lava! Ow, ow! Touched the lava, dude!

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

(whistles quietly)

MAN (on Radio):

He's the worst quarterback in the league, I mean, statistically, it would be better if he wasn't even playing, all right?

You're listening to the radio and writing with a pen?

What decade are we in?

NICK: I cannot listen to that guy.

Come on. Joe Napoli's the worst, man.

What? Man, that is blasphemous.

He's the king of sports radio, man.

I've got an interview with him today, okay?

He's hiring a new research assistant.

Hence... the research.

My old basketball coach set it up.

You know, I'm just trying to figure out how to break it to Elvin.

You gotta cut ties with that kid.

He freaks me out.

He never blinks.

He's like a tiny little owl in a shirt.

Hey, guys!

Hey. Hello. JESS: I have so much to tell you.

I spent the whole week with rich people.

I finally tried port.

Were you gone last week? Is that why it was so quiet?

I feel like I haven't seen you guys in so long.

You all look so handsome, so grown-up.

Thank you.

Hey, Nick.

I finally notice the one-eighth Cherokee.

Winston...

that's almost a mustache.

Yeah. It's creepy and thin, just like I like it.

How was your sexcation with Russell?

I did have a lot of sex. Thank you.

What'd you guys do without me? h*t me up with a headline!

Nothing. We played True American.

What?! You played True American without me? - Yes, ma'am.

(cell phone ringing)

Oh, sorry. It's Cece.

Hey, you!

Tell me everything. How's it going?

Where are you? CECE: With Schmidt.

Where are you?

Right here.

Wow.

I am not used to this yet.

I'm surprised this one's still standing.

We b*rned through a lot of ideas last night.

That's really great.

We went deep into the s*ab...

Yeah. Cool. NICK and WINSTON: Ugh.

I don't know. It's like we're living in a romantic comedy montage.

Like, we, like, throw our heads back when we laugh, and I, like, try on floppy hats for him.

It's pretty perfect.

It's like the first act of a TV movie until I find out that he has a wife and kids in another state.

Yeah, but nothing's perfect, right?

You're kind of doing everything on his terms, living in his beautiful, fancy house...

I'm not really living there.

Has he ever spent a night here?

Hey, guys.

So, listen, um...

Russell's gonna come and stay this weekend.

(groans)

I was just wondering if you guys could be cool?

Yeah.

Sure. JESS: Okay, uh...

Actually, I don't trust what

"cool" means to all of you, so how about we just say

"be normal"?

Big R.

Schmidt.

Your shoe's untied.

Oh.

What are you doing?

Label check, man.

What are you doing?

Label check.

What are you doing?

Just calm down.

(sighs)

Did...

(chuckles)

I got it.

(flushes)

Russell!

Whoa!

Oh, man, you scared me.

You scared of black people?

No.

It's 2012, baby.

I'm...

Yeah, of course. - Done deal.

Easy. - Of course.

Quick question.

Russell's such a visionary, would it be okay if I took him through my Idea Notebook?

Nope, not at all. - Maybe I won't take him through the whole notebook...

Or how about none of it?

But I have one that I'm really excited about called Real Apps, that I know Russell would be interested in.

No.

Nick, Real Apps is my idea.

Real Apps is not your idea.

SCHMIDT: Yeah, sure, you might have birthed the idea, but I midwifed it, and I midwifed the crap out of it.

Guys.

It was a messy birth.

NICK: You just thought of the name!

The name is everything.

The name is the name of the game.

The game is... is the name. The game is the name.

The product is the game.

Guys!

I know you can do this.

You sure you don't want to swing?

Nah. Pushing's where the action is.

(chuckles)

Elvin, listen, buddy. I think we should talk.

You know I'm not going to be here forever, right?

I know about death, Winston.

I know there's no farm where dogs and grandpas go.

What? No. It's just that I'm an adult.

It's time for me to get an adult job with adult people.

You understand, right?

Maybe we should get to work on your resume because yours is terrible.

It's 2012, Winston.

Typing is not a special skill.

And you're familiar with the show?

Yes, I am. I've been listening for years.

What do you think of Mr. Napoli?

He's actually like an idol of mine.

Be honest, jackass!

Would you consider yourself an undercover cop? - Huh?

Seriously. Are you a cop? You have to tell me. - No!

How far can you drag an unconscious man?

I don't know. I never really tried to... Hello, Mr. Napoli.

If you're as bad an assistant as you were a point guard, I'll eat you.

You know, I know you, Winston Bishop, okay?

Sub-par collegiate career, went to Latvia,

9% from the European-slash-

Women's 3-point line?

Okay, just...

Now you wind up in my lap.

Well, I'm the luckiest girl in school.

Hey, come on in, big guy. I want you to meet our new assistant, Winston Bishop.

Hey, first of all, I've not agreed to do it...

Welcome to the team, Winston.

Hope Joe hasn't been too tough on you.

I'm in. I'll do it.

Um...

So nice to meet you, Mr. Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

Can I sit on your shoulders?

Sure!

Really?

No.

Oh.

You've made a wonderful decision.

I'm sure you're going to learn a lot.

Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

NAPOLI: Yeah, well, welcome aboard. You can start today.

I want to Kareem about a segment on his show.

I want to talk to you about the jackets.

_

You said we were going to get show jackets!

Russell, hey.

I could show you around. I could show you our world.

Way up here, it's crystal-clear.

Nick, you're doing Aladdin.

Again?

Do you like cheeses, Russell?

What? That's...

Nick, come on.

It's for Russell.

So you really just call these "ethnic noodles"?

No, actually, I don't know.

The only English writing on the box is,

"Find water. Grow hot. Family celebrate plus."

That guy.

Nick, stop staring.

I'm not... what?

Schmidt's being really weird, too.

So I told you and Jess to go get some sushi at Asakune, but I hear you hara-kiri'd that one.

Well, I know the chef at Namuda.

Oh, oh. Namuda?

Maybe "My First Sushi."

Baby wants a tempura California roll.

Little Russell wants...

Little Wussell wants an avocwado roll!

JESS: Schmidt...! Nick, don't eat his noodles.

Yeah, but we're bowl brothers, now.

No, you're not.

Tighten up, guys. WINSTON: I'm gonna k*ll him.

I'm gonna punch him in his rich, old white dude face.

Not you.

Joe Napoli.

So I guess you didn't get the job?

No, I got the job. And that's the problem.

I want six shakes in my fridge at all times, ready to go.

And I want it BeyoncÃ©-colored.

Not darker, not lighter.

BeyoncÃ©!

Clean your damn desk!

(whispering):

Don't let him see you cry.

See, I want to k*ll him.

Russ, I was wondering if later, if you had a minute, if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my Idea Notebook.

Um... Hold that thought.

I will hold it.

Hold that thought 'cause he doesn't want to hear it, Nick.

Those ideas were 51% mine.

(garbage disposal rumbles, whines)

I got it, I got it! Russell, move, my man.

What'd I do?

No, you did nothing, my man. Don't blame yourself.

Yah! It just fights back a little bit, Russ.

(clattering)

Anchor me! Anchor me!

It's choking me! Come on. Go, go, go!

Come on!

(grunting)

Anchor me. Don't grope me.

Jess, get in there!

Jess!

NICK:

One more big one!

(groans)

(garbage disposal stops)

Oh, my God. Sorry.

RUSSELL:

You guys, my contractor knows a really great plumber. - Please.

I know the best plumbers in the business.

White guy knows a plumber.

Sorry. Plumbing's, like, a really sensitive topic around here.

I-I didn't know.

I mean, who would?

(chuckles)

Um...

hey...

who wants to play True American?

I'm in.

That sounds like a great idea.

JESS:

So it's 50%

drinking game,

50% life-size Candyland.

Well, it's more like 75 drinking,

20 Candyland, and by the way, the floor is molten lava.

It's actually 90% drinking, and it's got a loose Candyland-like structure to it.

JESS: Well, with steaks.

Hey, guys, we doing teams?

Yeah.

Ready?

One, two, three, go.

SCHMIDT: Two, two, four. WINSTON: Wow, I'm with Russell. Perfect.

What? You don't want to be on my team?

Well, I just copied you.

You haven't given me any information yet.

Oh, okay.


So it starts off there are four zones. An alternate zone is a crazy zone.

And there's a trail of chairs.

But the floor is lava.

These are the pawns. They're the soldiers of the secret order.

This is the king of the castle.

And remember, everything you hear in True American is a lie, knock on wood.

And it starts with a g*n tip-off, okay?

Oh, that I can do.

g*n, for sure.

Oh, yeah!

All right! Yeah!

(laughing)

Yeah! Yes!

Yeah, there's no going back now.

One, two, three, four, JFK!

FDR! Up, up, up! FDR!

(shouting)

Russell, you're in the lava, man.

I don't understand. Abe Lincoln, George Washington.

OTHERS:

Cherry tree!

(person whistles)

All right, Americans, you ready? Let's do the count.

ALL:

One, two, three.

That's me!

(others cheering)

Okay, remember:

The ground is lava.

OTHERS (chanting):

Russell! Russell!

Don't touch the lava. (cheering)

(laughs) NICK: Big R!

JESS:

Only thing we have to fear ALL:

Is fear itself!

Drink!

Drink!

(shouts unintelligibly)

(others shout unintelligibly)

(laughing)

Jimmy Carter... atop...

Grover Cleveland.

What now?

More beer.

More beer.

I got to get to the castle!

Go, Nick, go! Russell, you're kind of ripped up, huh?

Well, I used to work summers in a lumber camp near Banff, and I still split my own wood.

JFK! FDR!

You're pretty good at this, old-timer.

Ooh, ooh, Cece, this is the best game of True American ever.

I'm this close to winning.

I'm gonna go get in your bed.

Damn.

Yeah, I'm out.

Schmidt, no!

No!

Does it mean we win?

Yes, we win!

Whoo! (laughs)

(cheering)

BOTH:

USA! USA!

Oh, a little bit. Ah!

USA! USA!

RUSSELL:

I'm trashed.

I'm in a trash bag right now.

It's true.

I think we should call it a night.

No, no, hang on.

I was, I was saying something.

What you was saying to me. I remember.

Hey, guys, guys? I'm really sorry.

I'm on a water break.

It's over here.

Oh, man, you were giving me advice on my boss because you are also a rich white man. And that's okay.

Hell, yeah, I am!

(laughing)

Hey, I love ya.

. Russell, we have a big day planned tomorrow, so maybe we should...

Shh-shh, hang on a sec.

Let me straighten you out.

Here's what you do.

Your boss is power-playing you.

So you need to power-play him back.

Yes.

How do I do that?

Dip your boys in his shake.

What?!

That's all you gotta do.

Your testicles, dip 'em in, wring em out, dip it again and give him his shake. That's how you do it.

That's a terrible idea.

Jess, no, no. Shh.

Hang on. It's like a guy thing.

Territory. Jess, you don't know.

It's a guy thing, you know?

Jess doesn't get it. It's a territory...

Stop copying Russell.

I'm not copying him. I love him.

Classic is a classic, you know what I mean?

Just get in there, dunk your nuggets in his shake!

That's what I'm talking about.

Well, we all learned a lot.

You know what would make this night really great?

Idea Notebook.

Sleep.

Yeah?

Have you ever wanted to take a ride on a magic idea?

Well, strap on, Russell.

Russell, let's go to sleep.

I'll be in in a second.

I want to hear your idea.

Take one more of these, and then this idea's gonna be even better.

Okay.

Down the hatch!

(all groan)

Let's have a little bit more of that.

I'm mad at him, and I've never been mad at him before.

Oh, Jess!

This room is not a place of comforting, okay?

This is Darwin's jungle, where open-minded people do weird things to each other.

Go away.

Yeah.

I can't fight with him.

That's our thing. We don't fight.

He used to fight all the time with his ex-wife.

I think he likes that we're peaceful.

Fighting's good. It's healthy.

It's how you know it's working.

You know, Jess, what Cece and I like to do is we like to fight with our bodies.

It's like very intense game of Capture the Flag.

I won't make you guess what the flag is.

As my financial business partner, I appreciate you taking the time.

All right, Russell said we need a prototype.

So, Mr. Schmidt, I now present you "Real Apps."

The phone obviously goes back here where the phone goes, and then these are all the apps.

You've got a Zippo. You've got a fork.

You've got a spoon.

That's a corn holder.

It's also a gentleman's shiv.

Nick, it's a prototype of a prototype at best.

Let me see it.

No.

Don't be mean about it.

Come on, let me see it.

You got a bottle opener. - Come on.

Yeah. - Look at this.

There's no brushed steel, no nickel.

I mean, it's got none of the baller metals.

I mean, come on, man.

I'm not gonna get Winkelvossed because of your sloppiness.

What do you mean, "I"? Real Apps is my idea.

You just came up with the name!

Yeah, and the name is the game, friendo.

Mm-mm.

Yes, it is, man.

No, it isn't. No, it isn't, man.

Would you line up around the corner if they called the iPhone a "slippery germ brick"?

Yeah, actually, I might.

That's why they call it basketball and not "peach basket catch-it-up."

You just came up with that?

Hey, hey, we're back here on

the Joe Napoli Show, and let me

introduce you to a new member of the Joe Napoli Show family, and that is Winston Bishop, who is our new assistant.

I'll tell you what ... he's sharp as a tack.

Ladies, there's no ring on his finger, and, Winston, why don't you tell us just a little bit about yourself?

(goofy voice):

Hey, thanks, a lot, Joe.

I really want to tell you about myself.

You know, I been on the job two days, and I don't know how to make no milk shake.

Oh, and I played two years of mediocre Division I basketball. - Wow.

And why was that?

Well, because I really didn't know how to play basketball.

I got recruited for a girls' volleyball team.

All right, there he is. That's Winston Bishop.

And we'll see you again probably never.

All right, turning now to the NBA picture, it looks like the West...

These are hangover eggs.

See, they'll either stop you from throwing up the rest of the day or you'll just throw it up really fast.

It's high-risk, high-reward.

Oh, maybe I should just go back to bed.

I have a really nice day planned for us.

We're gonna go apple picking...

I don't... I don't pick apples.

That... that's... that's not gonna happen.

Are you serious?

Because it's picking and it's apple...

You're serious?

That literally sounds like hell.

Okay.

Are we in a fight?

We're not fighting.

This feels like a fight, Jess.

This is not a fight!

Russell, my man, it seems these days there's an app for everything.

Doesn't it, though?

Yeah, but there isn't.

Let's say I'm out and about, you know, being mobile, and I want to cut a bagel, cobble a shoe.

Haberdash on the fly.

Is there an app for that?

No. Is there?

Until now.

Right.

We now present to you...

Real Apps! Real Apps!

The prototype.

Hmm, hmm, hmm.

Relapse?

Real Apps.

Real Apps.

Relapse?

Relapse?!

Would you calm...?

You called my baby

"relapse"?!

No, I didn't call it anything. Just calm down!

I gave you 51% of this for Relapse?

Russell. Russell. Enough.

Russell...

Hold it in your hands, my man.

We're in the middle of something, guys. JESS: No, no, no.

We're great. We're fine. Show it to him, Schmidt. SCHMIDT: It's all right here.

Let me show it to you. NICK: Yeah, but you have to...

I want to... Russell.

You're going the wrong way.

Aah! Oh! Oh, oh, no!

Oh, my God, Russell, are you okay? NICK: No, no, no.

I've been s*ab!

It wasn't ready.

It wasn't ready.

You called it Relapse, idiot!

Where are the Band-Aids?

No Band-Aids! JESS: What?!

Ow! (panting)

I'll get you a takeout napkin with some Scotch tape.

Searing pain!

So sorry.

Here. Oh, sorry.

(groans) Ow! Ow! Jess.

Jess, do you know what? You just taped a napkin to my hand.

You know what? I'm gonna go.

I need to be home right now.

Is that a problem?

No.

I'm fine.

It's great.

We're great.

Yeah.

(mumbles)

I'm s...

Just nicked him.

(door closes)

(yells)

Get it all out.

I have an idea for your Idea book!

Replace the Band-Aids!

Very fair.

It's so sticky!

Oh, I have an app for that.

ELVIN:

What are you doing here?

Why aren't you at your new job?

I'm quitting.

You're quitting your dream job?

Well, I mean, there's good news.

I want to keep being your nanny.

That's what I've come to tell your mom.

I can't let you do that.

Mom? Mom?

Winston just asked me if he can smoke weed.

What?!

What?!

No, see...

He said when we go to the park, he wanted to do it.

And I get to hold it because I'm a minor.

Where is your imagination taking you? No!

You said that in front of my kid?!

Gina...

Are you serious?!

Are you completely insane?!

Gina, you know me, okay?

I'm wearing a tie and everything.

You're never, ever gonna nanny again.

I will destroy you on the nanny boards.

You can count on that. Come on, Elvin. Just...

Let me explain. Let me... Elvin, Elvin, Elvin, hey, now.

Elvin, let's get away. Get away from the hippie.

Come on.

Bye, Winston.

Bye, Elvin.

GINA: No, no, don't talk to him.

It's 4:20. Don't you have to be somewhere?

Oh, no.

The shakes.

Six... Where are you, number six?

NAPOLI: Hey, Bishop, I thought you left early.

Assumed you weren't coming back.

There was something wrong with the shakes, so I went in and just threw them out because there's something wrong with 'em.

Speaking of which, I should probably go ahead and throw that one out. What did you do to the shakes?

They've been compromised.

What... did... you... do?

Look, I really, really want this job, Mr. Napoli, and I know you're going to f*re me if I tell you what I did, but I would love a future here, and I don't want that to be jeopardized by a moment of... poor judgment.

I put my beans in your shakes.

Yeah, and I...

I shook it around a little bit like this.

In there? You stuck 'em down in there, huh?

I did.

(laughing)

(laughing)

Oh, man!

(laughing)

(laughs weakly)

You know what we're gonna do?

We're gonna do that to Kareem.

(chuckles)

Hi.

Hi.

I have something to say to you.

You don't have to apologize.

Well, I'm not here to apologize.

I'm here to fight with you, and I don't care if you want to fight or not.

All right, let's fight.

Well, I was prepared to have a perfectly nice weekend with you, and you just give up, and you come home.

Because I was bleeding from my hand. I had to go to the ER.

I had to get a stitch.

Ooh, stitches.

I'm too fancy for a Band-Aid.

I'm actually... I'm actually really sorry about that.

Jess, I haven't played a drinking game in ten years.

The only reason I did is

'cause you asked me to.

If I want to have a drink, I don't really have to play a game while I'm doing it.

Well, that's my world. Garbage disposals don't work.

Elevators don't pass inspection.

Wait. I didn't know about the elevator.

Yeah, it was, like, the cables were really thin. We signed a waiver.

They took 100 bucks off our rent.

That's really not safe!

Well, that's where I live, and those are my friends.

And that wasn't even the first s*ab this month.

And Russell, my life is just as important as your life.

And if you want to get with me, you're gonna have to get with my friends, and that is a Spice Girls song.

(chuckling)

(laughing)

We just had a fight.

I won.

You did not win.

Hey, tell you what. Let's just go back to your loft and try again.

Let's just hang out.

Oh. Now?

I mean... I just got here.

Maybe later.

(laughs)

Okay, that sounds like a plan.

Those boxers you borrowed ... I'm gonna need them back.

They're my lucky underpants.

Lucky underpants?

And what are the values of the Olympic games?

Openness, exchange.

The first victims of an authoritarian security regime.

I'm Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and that's The View from Up Here.

Are you ready to run?

I have my playlist all ready.

Actually, it's Diane Keaton's autobiography, and she just filmed First Wives Club, and it's getting me pumped!

I totally forgot we were going to run today.

I e-mailed you, like, three times.

Maybe you typed

"gmoil" again.

No more excuses ... we have to train.

We signed up for this charity run and now we have to do it.

Why can't we just donate the money?

Why do we have to run the six miles first?

That's a good point, but, no, you're gonna go...

Oh, no, Jess, look, I can't go.

I am super hungover right now.

Plus, Masha had a bit of a crisis.

She accidentally ate a cookie.

What?

Because she fell on it.

I am devastated.

She is devastated.

Well, why don't you come running with us?

No, she definitely can't.

You can run off that cookie.

It's great.

You know what? We will do it tomorrow, I promise.

It's more money for charity.

It'll be so fun.

I mean, that was a close one.

Good thing I'm a quiet breather.

I learned that as a kid playing "Who passed out?"

with my mom.

My mom always won.

Jew in the couch, Jew in the couch.

Nadia, American manners.

Sorry.

Jew-Jew person in couch.

She's not wrong.

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

Okay, bye, Nick.

So you'll call me?

Um, yeah, yeah, I'll definitely...

Are you, are you okay?

I'm gonna call you.

Um, okay.

Do you hike? Do you hike?

Okay, I...

This was fun.

Okay, I'll call you tonight to make sure you're okay?

Please.

That was ridiculous.

I can't do this, Winston.

I don't know how to sleep with 21-year-old girls, and for the last couple weeks, that's all I've been doing.

What's going on with you? Are you okay?

I saw something a few days ago.

Now, I've been sworn to secrecy, but it is just too big.

You know I can't keep a secret, I can't lie, Winston. You saw me with that girl. - Don't leave me like this.

Even thinking about keeping a secret turns my back into a Slip 'n Slide.

Come on, man, you got to help me out, okay? I'm dying.

I don't want to know.

Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on...

I'm dying! I'm dying, man!

I don't want to know.

I don't want to know!

Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!

Ew.

It's happening under our roof.

No.

Yes.

No.

Yes!

This makes me hate things.

I know, man. It's like up is down.

Up is the new down, man.

Now my back is sweating.

All right, who knows?

Everybody but Jess.

Hey.

Hey, Jess.

We're just hanging out in the hallway.

What's going on? Nothing's going on.

Yeah, actually, I'm really annoyed.

Cece bailed on me again. We were supposed to train for that race this weekend.

That is so Cece.

I know... I mean, and the weird thing is that she said she was hungover, but last night she said she didn't want to go out.

Maybe she had a guy over.

Not like that ... I didn't say anything.

If you think about what I said, I didn't say anything.

You have a secret.

You have a secret.

No, you have a secret.

Turn around.

You turn around.

Let me see your back.

Please don't.

J- ust be cool about...

Ew, gross.

J'accuse, Miller,

j'accuse.

You fold like a lawn chair.

Fold, fold.

Yes, you ... fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.

Winston told me Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!

Come on, man!

What?!

Oh, my God.

They know, Schmidt.

Sweatback?

You told Sweatback? Come on, Winston.

Jess.

God.

I am so sorry that you had to hear about this like this.

But, I mean, can we just take a moment to celebrate me?

Schmidtty really did it this time.

I mean, I'm having Indian every night.

No, no!

Whoa, whoa!

Jess, I'm really sorry you found out this way, okay, but trust me, it wasn't some big conspiracy.

It was just something that happened and then it got out of control, sort of like poison oak and I just couldn't stop scratching it.

Cece started it.

That's...

I did, I started it.

Why, Cece? Are you trying to get back at your parents?

When did it start?

Jess, I want to emphasize that we are not dating.

I can't stress that enough.

This is just sex.

Mm-hmm, when did it start?

1:03 a.m., February 15, right on schedule.

Two months ago.

Two months?

Two moons have passed since you started doing it?

Why do you start talking like a Native American when you get angry?

Two moons have passed!

Just a quick sidebar.

Uh, we've done it in every room of the apartment.

Ugh, even my room?

Just the one time.

Oh, God.

How long have you known?

A few days.

You didn't tell me either?

Jess, just as a reminder, I told you seconds after I found out.

Because you're weak, Nick, weak.

Okay, I agree. Just chill out. Stop yelling.

Jess, I want to tell you everything.

What do you want to know?

I don't know, Cece. How would I know if you're telling the truth?

Come on, Jess.

Are you seriously mad?

No, no, I'm not.

I'm really glad you two are having fun.

How cool is that?

For what it's worth I think what I did was really brave.

Oh.

Get off of me.

Yeah.

Hey, have you guys seen a scarf?

Holly said she left it out here.

It's my favorite scarf because it's a circle, so you never have to think about which end goes on the right or the left.

My therapist gave it to me.

She's Asian, but she's the nicest.

Who is that?

Nobody, just...

Who was that?

Was it that stuck-up bitch from last night with the fake hand?

Whoa.

No, it was no one.

It was just... it was just beep-beep-beep.

Was...

I'm so old.

I don't even know how to use a cell phone.

Come on. Let's go clubbing.

You want to go clubbing?

Show me the phone.

Let's go back to when we were having fun.

Let me see the phone.

No, just chill out.

Let me see your phone.

No!

Smooth.

I'll call you.

Nick, are you kid...?

What, you keep the ringer on?

Amateur move, man.

Yeah, I'm just in over my head.

Schmidt, I hate asking you this, but how do you do this?

Oh, glory be, are you asking for my help?

Oh, I-I'm flattered.

Pull up, pull up, Nick. Yank back on that yoke.

We have to face the reality of the situation.

Schmidt has been having consensual sex with Cece and lying about it.

He's better than us at this, Winston, and I hate it as much as you do, and, Schmidt, I hate saying this, but I might...

I might respect you.

Thank you for saying that.

You've come a long way, man.

Since my 20s, I've had a string of lesser paramours which, like weathered stone steps, have led me to the Hindu temple, a.k.a. Cece, because she's Indian.

You don't have to be so gentle with me.

All right, oh, that's how I like it, baby.

All right.

Sex, man. It's the real stuff.

I don't know that I should help you.

You're not a player.

You're a clingy serial monogamist with ... well, with a terrible metabolism.

Schmidt, I need you...to teach me to be a douchebag.

Let's get to work.

What's happening in the world?

Hey, babe.

Oh, hey, Cece.

Doing some stretches?

Good guess, model.

No, just limbering up in case I want to have sex with one of your roommates.

Do you want some company?

What?

Do you want some company?

I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

Diane Keaton is talking about her rich life full of loyal friends.

Oh, Jess, I hate when we fight.

I get so stressed out.

I mean, my eye twitches back.

I'm eating bread, all right?

Just let me come on this run with you.

No!

Seriously, Jess, it was just one secret.

Everybody has got secrets.

Good afternoon.

Uh, my name is Mr. Schmidt. M-R...

Not even a real chalkboard.

First of all, Nick, congrats.

Thank you.

You're meeting a lot of young women, and for whatever reason, they seem to, you know, find you appealing.

In the restaurant of life, you have selected the tasting menu.

Okay, I changed my mind. I don't want to do this any more.

Nick, you're terrible at lying, so what we want to do is, we want to focus on S.S.V.

I cannot believe you slept with Cece.

Short, simple...

vag*na.

Vague. It's actually... it's actually vague.

Let's apply it. I'm one of these young girls that's coming in here.

I want to party. I'm in college. Let's do this. - I'm in.

Hey, what happened to your phone?

Jesus took it.

A Jesus hawk on a speedboat.

The environment.

Bears, family, magic.

Mm-hmm.

I need your help, Schmidt.

Yeah.

I'm the girl, and the whole objective is to get me out of the front door as fast as you possibly can.

Let's do this.

Ready?

Yeah.

What's your name?

My name is Janine, all right?

God.

Don't make that sound.

Good morning, Nick.

You really gave it to me good last night.

You gave me the full business, yeah.

This is really weird, Schmidt.

It's one of the weirder things we've done, right?

What you thinking, brown eyes? Want to grab some brunch?

Sure, Janine, that sounds fun.

God ... no, you don't want to grab brunch.

Okay.

Come on, damn it, Nick.

I'm all turned around.

Focus.

I just had sex with Janine.

I have feelings for her.

Yeah, so you're done.

Oh, I just sleep with her and then kick her out like she's a piece of meat?

This is the problem.

All right, ask me again, Schmidt.

Okay, cowboy, want to saddle up and go again?

No, sweetie, I can't.

Good ... why can't you?

I got things to do. I got plans. - You have work.

Plans can be canceled.

I don't want to live in a house of lies.

I can't do it any more.

Is this happening, too?

No, this is not happening.

No, this is not happening.

This isn't what it looks like.

Okay, look, fine, from now on, we are going to be open and honest in this loft, and that means that I have some secrets I want to get off my chest.

I'd rather not hear those.

Nobody wants to hear these.


Schmidt, a couple months ago I found Nick using your chenille throw as a napkin.

That is a microfiber blend from Pakistan, you heathen.

Stop quoting the catalog like a weirdo.

Each heirloom-quality...

Good, this is healthy. Air it out.

All right, one more.

Schmidt said that Winston is in danger of becoming a nanny for life.

He said you were going "full Poppins."

Okay, Winston, I can see anger in your eyes.

Schmidt said he thinks about you sometimes when he's making love to himself.

What?

One time.

What?!

I thought about bangs and your face just appeared beneath them.

Okay, by the way, like I'm the only one.

Nick told me it happened to him, like, like, a bunch of times.

Winston, you told me the first week you got back from Latvia, you had a sex dream about Jess, and she had raccoon hands.

Dreams do not count.

You've all thought about me while self-completing?

Yeah. Yeah.

Look, Jess, it's not that big a deal.

Really, it's, it's the sincerest form of flattery.

We're going back to keeping secrets.

When I walk through this door and into my room, this conversation never happened.

Oh, my God!

So, what did the raccoon hands look like?

Oh, man, they were digging through the garbage.

Oh, my God!

Do not drink my almond milk when you spent the whole night drinking Schmidt.

Why are you dressed like a Mexican wrestler?

Because Cece, I don't want to live in a world with secrets.

And that means that I now know my three roommates have all thought about me while self-completing.

So, I'm gonna wear my winter clothes until I can deal with that fact.

But it's better than not knowing.

Is it really better?

Yeah, it is.

Jess, I don't want to fight with you any more, okay?

I said I was sorry.

We tell each other everything. We always have.

I've never not told you something.

That's what second base means?

Then I'm not a virgin any more.

Is it weird that he wants me to talk in a deep voice and call myself Kevin?

I had a dream that I k*lled you.

You tell me everything, all right?

I stopped telling you everything because every time I did, you got so judgmental and critical.

What?!

I had to give it a try, Jess.

I mean, that was the same hand that was inside Elmo.

Cece.

Okay, yeah, you got me.

You don't have secrets, Jess, because you never do anything stupid.

Look at me!

With guys.

So, living with Spencer for six years was not a mistake?

Cece, I'm not judging you.

It's just... Schmidt?

Judging. See what that is?

No. I'm not judging until now.

Don't look at me!

Oh, Jess, would you please!

A winter hat is not gonna make us stop thinking about you from time to time when we delight ourselves.

Oh, no!

Hey, could you guys keep it down? I have a lady visitor.

Hi, Nick.

Oh, I get it.

It's actually kind of a fantasy of mine.

Can you say the following words out loud?

"The ice roads are too dangerous!

You're gonna have to turn back, Chief."

I'm not saying that.

Okay.

I want my scarf.

It is 62 degrees out, and I am freezing.

No. I had work. I-I have plans. I...

Get in there! Come on!

Can I just pay you for the scarf?

Fine. $25.

25...! No, I'll just help you look for it.

Nick, where'd you go?

Are you kidding me? No, no, no. It's a bear.

There's a magic bear in there! That's all it is is a magic bear. Just stop. Just...

Hey, Nick.

Who is this?

Can I have this circle scarf?

It's my scarf.

No.

It's my scarf!

It's mine!

It's mine! It's mine!

Nick, I just want you to know that I am not judging you right now.

Oh, yeah. Right, sure.

Ladies, let's not do this.

At least not with our shirts on.

Do you know how many things I haven't told you?

Nol I don't, because, apparently, I don't know you at all.

Are you running a 10K tomorrow?

Who knows? Are you even against MS any more?

Beats me!

Ow! Ow! Ow!

They've stopped hitting each other, and they're just hitting me!

All right, you want to go? This New Year's, I wasn't at my parents' house.

I was down in St. Barths with a guy who might be an arms dealer.

And my feet aren't whiter than yours.

I just told you that to make you feel better.

And when we were ten years old, I went to the movie My Girl

with Jessica P before I saw it with you!

Ow! Ow! Ow!

And... I own a motorcycle.

Jessica P?!

Jessica freaking P?

Oh, my God, are you crying under there now?! - No! No!

I think you are.

No, I am not.

All right, everybody stop!

Wherever you are right now, just sit down!

Okay, now, Saturday is a day for sleeping, and damn it, you will not take that away from me!

You ... give her her scarf back.

Finders keepers is not a thing.

You ... get out of my house!

Who are you?

Who am I?

Who am I? Well, I am Theodore K. Mullins.

And Nick is my lover on the down low.

Tell her, Nick. Tell her how it really goes down in apartment 4D.

Oh, great n*gro spiritual, please come down and loose these chains on this woman!

Flesh on flesh.

When the lights are off, we are all the same.

Not true.

Dear lord, help me, Father!

Get out of my house.

Get out of my house!

Yeah. I'm out.

I'm leaving.

Hey, can you give me a ride?

Get out.

I'm gonna stop and get a manicure.

Do you want to...?

Okay. Yeah.

You told Harpo to b*at me?

Bye, guys.

You want them over me?

Over me?! You...

You're sweating so much, it looks like rain, and you...

You, you're peaking, man.

You're at the prime of your life. That's actually...

Cece, get rid of the motorcycle! And Jess, don't act like you haven't thought about us, too, when you're going solo.

Okay? I don't work a

9:00-to-5:00. I'm here all day.

I can hear you!

Now, go away, because I'm... having cereal.

Runners, take their marks.

âª Around with them âª
âª I don't want to walk around with them âª
âª 'Cause I don't want to walk around with them âª
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh âª
âª I don't want to walk around with them âª
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh âª
âª I don't want to walk around with them... âª

Why do all female runners look like old German women when they run?

Oh, boy, look at her glisten!

Oh, Cece.

That sports bra is doing God's work right now.

Two months. - I can't stop. I got to b*at Jess.

What are you...? What is wrong with you, sir?

That is Cece's water!

You animal!

This thing with our girls has gotten out of control.

Our girls?

Yeah, it makes me really sad to see them fighting over me like this.

Then why are you smiling?

Have you guys... seen... Cece?

Yeah, she's way down there.

Hasn't even broken a sweat.

Jess, okay. Jess, arms up.

Arms up. I need you long and loose like sea grass.

Moving. Move...

Oh, my God, why?!

I'm sorry.

I'm just mad at you.

My adrenaline is going.

Did you make that?

What?

And Cece let you wear it?

What? She thought it was funny.

Cece! Cece?

Cece!

What's that about, man?

I mean, I think the shirt's pretty funny, no?

Not funny at all.

Puns are creepy, and they freak me out, and you know that. - I like it.

Nick!

Oh, no, no, no.

I hooked up with both those girls last week.

I didn't know they knew each other. I thought they just lived in the same apartment.

Why didn't you call me? - Why didn't you tell me you hooked up with my roommate?

I don't...

Willow, I didn't call you because I had a family emergency.

Is everything okay?

Yes, it is.

And Megan, I didn't tell you about Willow because the moment we had was so beautiful and intense, that for a second I thought we were the only people on the planet.

Oh. Okay.

Well, we'll see you later.

Bye.

Bye, guys.

It worked.

Where did that come from?

I don't know. I'm trembling, but it worked.

That was so good my pants just got tight, Nick.

Oh, God, now I hate me as much as I've always hated you. - Skin.

See, I have to do this now.

No, you don't. Don't do it.

Yes, I do. - Skin. All you have to do is just not do it.

I have to. No, because it works.

Cece?

Cece, I can't... breathe.

Cece, I know why you didn't tell me about Schmidt ... because you like him!

What?!

The shirt, Cece.

You thought the shirt he made was funny.

You obviously like him.

It's the only explanation for thinking that's funny.

Oh, my God, I think you're right.

And you didn't want to tell me

'cause you knew that I would know.

And you weren't ready to admit it to yourself.

Okay, can we just say that I didn't tell you because I'm a total bitch?

'Cause I'm way more comfortable with that.

Oh, maybe I like Schmidt.

You... You can't tell anyone.

Yeah. That's like a secret only I know.

Heads up.

I'm-I'm peeing.

Oh, my God.

Okay, come on. We got to finish.

Oh! No!

Oh, come on, man. Come on, dude!

Hey, here they come. Here they come.

Come on, guys! Let's go!

Come on, ladies! Be strong!

Come on! Come on, ladies!

Come on, guys.

All right, let's go!

Come on... Come on...

Finish strong!

Good job, guys.

Winner! Oh, man.

Thanks for waiting, man.

Hey, thanks for the ten bucks.

Guess what, you guys.

My shoes are filled with blood!

Oh, God.

I think it's time to go home. A little help. Come on.

All right, Cece, I got her, I got her.

All right. Okay, Jess, here we go.

Okay, Schmidt, grab her feet.

All right, there we go.

Lead us away.

Good job, Jess.

Real proud of you.

What are you doing to that basil, Cece?

You trying to make it confess?

Easy with the Kn*fe, Robespierre.

I will cut off your weaker fingers, Schmidt, and I'm gonna start with your pinky.

You guys are adorable.

We are not adorable.

Okay? We are just two people having casual, successful sex.

My bad.

Please.

All right. I can't stand this heat.

I gonna get out of the kitchen.

Ow. Ow.

You should really stretch, Jess.

Ow.

You know, Jess thinking that we're a cute couple is...

I don't... It's kind of a turnoff.

How do we explain to her that this is just... it's just sex?

Mm-hmm.

What is that?

That is shoddy workmanship is what that is.

I'm taking you off prep.

Go clean the garbanzo beans.

I'm taking my Kn*fe.

Be careful with that Kn*fe.

It's from Japan.

Why? Why, Cece?

Why am I sleeping with Schmidt?

Is it a pity thing?

Is he sick?

Are you working for the government?

Damn it, he's holding you against your will, isn't he?

If he is holding you against your will, blink twice.

Blink twice.

Are you tired of being turned on?

Hmm? You have a mole fetish?

Is it huge?

I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.

Is it huge?

Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom Tony the Tiger style.

Naked with a kerchief?

What?

Naked with a kerchief.

No, what do you call top, no pants?

Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh or a Paddington. - Honey the Smacks Frog.

There's a Donald the Duck.

I guess pretty much any kind of bear except for Yogi

'cause that's naked with a tie.

Alvin, Simon, Theodore.

I saw his entire butt.

Look, Dirk's a good guy.

He was my roommate when I was in law school.

Smartest guy I know.

So, he's a lawyer?

No, he's not a lawyer, but he does have a law degree, a business degree, and a master's in agriculture.

He's kind of like a degree collector.

He's got his PhD in poetry, so...

That sucks for poems.

How'd it go with Fancyman?

It was an amazing first date, except for one awkward part at the end.

I don't go on dates very often.

Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.

Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.

Unless they dig for it.

I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.

Oh, hi.

Black sedan?

Uh, yeah.

What?

So, he patted me on the back.

I thought I'd at least get a front pat. Whoo-ha!

What?

Look, he probably just got nervous.

No, Russell's never nervous.

That's the worst answer.

Winston, what do you think?

Oh, thank God.

Hey, what's up, baby?

Ooh.

Hey, is that Shelby?

What was that? That was a cat sound.

Oh, because you did the whip, we should've...

Guys! - It should have been the other way around.

Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.

But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.

You got it.

That sounds good.

No, that was a joke; I love it when you guys ask me stuff. It makes me feel really important.

And I love it...

"One shade the more,"

"One ray the less,"

"Had half impaired the nameless grace."

Are you wearing a ladies' scarf?

Come to my lecture tomorrow night.

Absolutely not.

She's missing out, my man.

Hey, Schmidt?

Yeah?

Mind if I borrow your car to take Shelby to the airport?

Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.

Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the, uh,

"man-bulance"?

The man-bulance is resting. He needs to get ready for the corporate team-building retreat on Monday.

That's cool. I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle all of Shelby's luggage anyway.

Ooh... What the hell is wrong with you, Winston?

The man-bulance could fit the luggage of nine Shelbys.

It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.

You know what? Here you go, Winston.

There you go.

Enjoy luxury.

All good, man.

I got your second set, so thank you.

How'd you get my second set of keys?

Hey, someone left your door open.

Someone left your face beautiful.

Who is that?

Apparently, his name is Dirk.

Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.

But should that stop you from seeing this?

Yeah!

That's awesome. Does he keep you happy?

He does what he's told.

So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?

Oh, you're a sex-cretary?

I am definitely the boss.

Sex-cretary, he just made that up.

âª Who's that girl? âª

âª Who's that girl? âª

âª Who's that girl? âª

âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess âª

I hate bachelorette parties.

I have, like 50 different penis items in my carry-on.

This plane goes down, there's gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff.

Sharks? I thought you were going to Vegas?

No, I'm going to Mexico. I thought I told you that.

Hmm-mm.

Well, if you don't want me to go, I don't have to go.

No, no, no, no, no, no, I want you to go.

It'll be good, you know?

We spent the last five nights together.

I mean, you know, we both could use some space.

Right.

Did I say something wrong?

What?

I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you across all the space.

Hey.

Great news, um, Jess is taking a shower.

Okay, I just need, like, a good, solid ten minutes.

Eat this granola bar first.

I want to try something called the horse trough.

No, Cece.

I'm not having sex with you right now.

I have to get everybody in the company's name into a version of "We Didn't Start the f*re."

Totally fine.

What do you need, like, 20 minutes?

Cece, this... Okay, this is real work for my real boss who is not you.

Oh, I get what's happening here.

It's 'cause Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist."

A sex receptionist answers calls all day.

A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.

So, first of all, thank you for the demotion.

And second of all, I quit.

So, I'll see you tonight.

Did you not hear anything I just said?

Oh, no, I totally heard you loud and clear, but do you know who didn't happen to hear you?

What are you doing?

Don't-don't-don't involve them.

Oh, my...

They just didn't hear.

Don't bring them into this.

Don't tell me.

Tell them.

Hi.

I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar, I love... I love you both.

All the zany adventures we've had.

But we can't go to White Castle today.

Just can't do it.

You're serious about this?

Cece?

Is Schmidt bothering you?

This is not over.

Okay?

Was it like a caress or like a... like a pat?

No, like a pat;

It was distinctly a pat, and it was actually kind of hot.

The man knows how to pat a back.

At any point during the night, did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?

Maybe.

Once or twice.

No, stop, it freaks me out and you know.

Well, what do I do?

I really, really want to see him again, like, badly.

You just call him.

I can't.

He's too sophisticated.

He told me he'd run with the bulls, and I quote,

"not the touristy bulls in Pamplona."

Big deal. Just call him.

Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power unless she's sexting, in which case, she gains a half power.

Okay, well, that's Schmidt just talking...

I mean, what does Schmidt know?

Look, all the guys that you live with ... boys.

You've only dated boys.

Russell is a grown man, and I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.

He has a hot air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.

Okay, sweetheart, you are sophisticated.

You've just got to pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.

You know what? You're right:

I am sophisticated.

I'm gonna do this.

What is that?

It's a phone.

Oh, God.

And thus ends our journey through the words of time.

From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan, from Dylan to Dylan.

They're both named Dylan.

Watch him bring it home, man.

Do I have to?

We have to rage.

"Rage against the dying of the light.

"And when the light is no longer bright."

"Don't think twice, it's all right."

It's over.

Smartest guy I know.

Professor?

Professor?

Yeah?

We wanted to remind you about the post-lecture wine and cheese event.

A soiree, eh?

Super classy.

Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.

Yeah, I-I e-mailed you about that.

That was me. - Oh, sometimes when I get a really long e-mail...

I don't read it.

Bye.

Oh, Mommy.

All right, Dirk, what about Deb?

You guys having problems or something?

No, no, no, everything's fine.

She left me and moved out of the house.

I guess it was "too hard to support me."

"Financially."

It's all fine; her leaving has allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.

Scarves?

Undergraduate ladies.

You see, girls our age, what do they want?

They want us to wed them, sire their children.

They want you to have a-a bedframe.

Right, yeah.

Hmm? They want you to eat off plates, but girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.

Yeah, but don't they want to hang out wth guys their own age?

Have you hung out with a

20-year-old dude lately?

Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low. - Right.

They haven't even gone through their gay phase yet. - Hey, man, I'm gonna give Shelby a call really quick.

Just want to check on her, see if everything's all right.

Sounds good, man.


What, dude, relax, okay?

I just said we're gonna give each other space, doesn't mean I can't call her, right, to see if anything funny happened on the plane.

You know what "space"

means, right?

That's space to have sex with other people.

No, space means you go to Mexico, and you do not have sex with other people.

Watch this.

Nick, don't give my any space.

You got it, my man.

See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now, doesn't it?

Now, Nick, I want you to give me some space.

You got it.

All this space allows me opportunity to have as much sex as we want.

Smartest guy I know.

See how much sex we could be having?

That-that does...

Get out of my way, bookworms!

You ready to make love to some college chicks?

Hey, when's the last time you had mono?

I don't know.

Tomorrow, you're gonna say yesterday.

I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.

What... are you wearing?

I don't... I don't know.

I mean, I found this at the lost and found at the gym.

I'm not really sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.

I've never had to do this.

I've never had to seduce somebody before.

If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my aunt Frieda at Seder.

Come on, okay?

I will do anything, and I'll do it anywhere.

All right?

Even fantasy location...

number three?

Okay.

Um, how good are the Beatles?

Beatles are the best.

Were you so upset when they broke up?

I would have been, but I was one.

Well, you're not one any more.

How's your prostate?

Uh...

I had my breast exam last week, and, like, they're fine.

It's just boob in there, but we have to be careful.

Our bodies are decaying.

Are you okay?

You seem strange.

Why didn't we kiss the other night?

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

No, it's fine.

Oh.

What?

Hey, I...

Is everything okay? Oh.

I got to go.

This ought to take care of the dinner. - Yeah.

Okay?

Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without, um...

Here, there's cab fare.

Get home safe.

Oh.

Baby, look, I don't want space, okay?

I don't want anyone to have space.

I want to be standing right in front of you.

I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.

I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.

No flights tonight.

Hey, Schmidt, do you mind if I borrow your car again?

"Of course you can, Winston. You're so great."

Thank you!

Nope.

Hey, my name's Nicholas.

Nick, Nick.

Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.

Oh, I do.

Dirk, I feel so old here.

Is calling a girl "Shorty"

still cool?

We just got to find your angle with these college girls.

Your hook, your panty-melter.

Usually, my hook is that it's closing time, and I'm there.

You were a panty-melting icon in law school.

If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.

Hey.

Don't-don't do this.

Skyler, Miriam, come over here for a second.

Don't humiliate me, Dirk.

How cool is my friend, Nick?

Are you a professor, too?

No, no, no, I'm a bartender.

30 years old, I don't have health insurance.

You know how to make drinks?

Panty-melter.

Do I know how to make drinks, did you say?

Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?

Yeah, I do that professionally.

You could get me drunk professionally?

Are you a cop?

Sometimes.

Do you have identification on you?

I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.

Five nights a week.

Jess, you made it to the party!

What's going on? Why is the cast of the Social Network

in our apartment?

Dirk is a genius!

20-year-old girls ... they think I'm awesome!

And look at 'em!

They don't know what

Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.

I'm Skyler's Fancyman!

Can you believe it?

Where's your Fancyman? Where is he?

I don't know. It was horrible.

He left and gave me

$100 for a cab!

You know what?

I'm gonna use the remaining 90

to get out of here and start a new life.

It's been nice knowing you.

Hey...!

I'm gonna die alone!

Oh, no!

I am so, so sad right now.

My heart hurts!

You want Nick to make you a bayberry breeze?

'Cause he is so smart.

So smart.

Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

This.

I'm not happy! 30 sucks!

Ah, weird party move.

âª It's time to try defying gravity âª
âª I think I'll try defying gravity âª

It's been two hours.

This is officially crazy.

Also, I have to go to the bathroom.

Just pee yourself.

So you'd rather sit in my urine for the rest of the car ride than admit to Winston that we're sleeping together?

Yep, absolutely. Don't even have to think about it.

I don't want to ruin what we have, okay?

Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions, like, "Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"

And, "Seriously, why?"

You think we have something to ruin?

Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.

And I was wearing shoulder pads.

So I obviously must like sleeping with you.

A secre-tarty.

Shut... up.

This is pretty great.

I'm freezing.

Yeah.

I'm so cold.

How are you not freezing?

Does brown skin retain heat?

âª Instead of dreary who-you-were, well, are âª
âª There's nothing that can stop you from becoming popular âª
âª Lar âª
âª La, la âª
âª La, ah-ah, ah... âª

Take out your tampon and drink, Trevor!

The Flip Queen has spoken!

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

Shelby.

Babe, I don't want space.

Neither do I!

That's why I'm at your apartment.

I got on a plane. I wanted to see you.

What?!

Babe, look, I'm in Mexico. I came to see you.

Are you serious?

I miss you, Shelby.

You're so sexy, girl.

In or out of the wig.

I don't care. Shelby.

You make me so feel brave, babe, and I've never felt like this about anybody else before.

I love you.

And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.

I love you, too.

I'm coming back, baby. No space!

Are you traveling with any non-US citizens?

You actually catch people with that line?

No, sir, just me and my American heart...

full of love.

Then how do you explain...

this?

I can't... sir.

No one in the entire world can explain that.

I am so tall!

I feel like a Chinese basketball player.

Russell?

Oh.

Hey, Jess.

I'm not Jess.

I'm her cousin... Sylvia?

Are you doing okay?

I want a donut.

Then let's get you a donut.

Please?

I want to talk to you... alone.

Well, this is a fun group.

Hmm. Can you drop me off at my dorm?

It's called Hamilton.

I'd like to vomit now.

God!

I've never jumped out of a moving car before!

That was bad-ass!

Hey, uh, kiddo.

Okay.

Nick, that's the road.

What's up?

You want the woods.

I want the woods. You're smart, Russ.

Come here.

Hey, it was nothing.

You're okay, Russ.

Okay, we can hug some more later.

This isn't her, you know.

She's not like us.

She's one of the good ones.

Time to make the puke, Russell.

So listen, man, it's-it's really important to us that our completely equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, uh, remain a secret, and while I respect the fact that you listen to

Wicked while you're alone, I could use that information against you at any point in time.

By the way, there's a stop sign, like, right up...

Is that a stop sign?

Well, you'd probably want to slow down...

Oh, my God. Maybe it's a go sign.

I don't think it's a go sign.

Because if somebody like you is sleeping with someone like her, then maybe the whole damn world is upside down!

It's just what I'm thinking.

And I want to talk to you.

I want to have a chance to explain.

That's okay. I understand.

I just... I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls

'cause we think you're cool.

And you know what?

It's working because...

I think you're a hotty with a body.

Oh. Um...

I got to tell you, I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.

I asked you out because I like you.

But I-I've forgotten really how... how to do this, you know.

I haven't dated since 1989...

when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.

1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.

Oh.

The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.

Sarah's with her this weekend, I didn't pack her inhaler.

She was having an asthma att*ck.

Is Sarah okay?

Yeah.

Yeah. Thanks. I-I...

I just feel like I should have explained.

And I really wanted to kiss you the other night.

Really?

I wanted to do more

than kiss you.

I'd like to do you, at some point.

Like, you know, really, really give it to you good.

Uh, but I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.

I was nervous.

You were nervous?

Nick was right.

He can be really wise sometimes.

Oh, my God, it's happening!

It's coming! I think I'm dying!

I feel scared and excited!

What do you think?

What do I think of what?

Do you think now is the right moment?

I think so.

Okay.

Get out of me, you poison!

Wait. Is that your hand?

No.

That's my hand.

Oh, my God!

You're welcome.

Get out of here, Dirk!

You get out of here...

Come here.

Hey!

Oh, no!

Where are you guys?

Hello?

Hey, where are you guys?

Hey, could I have walked out into the mountains?

When does a hill become a mountain?

It just happened.

I'm so cold.

Who is this?

Oh, my God, Dirk is d*ad!

Dirk is d*ad!

Greatest guy I knew.

Buying a phone's a big deal.

I mean think of how long you'll have this thing.

It's like buying a car or a bra.

Eight years, man. Ow.

Hey, uh, sorry, I was just checking your credit score, and I got this number that's crazily low, so I'll try again.

Don't bother. I'm sure it's right.

Seriously?

Are you kidding me?

250?! You get 150

just for being alive.

Hey, Mojan!

Got a 250 credit score!

Well, I guess the $40 I saved on that Gap card didn't pay off.

Do you have, like, a box of charity phones you're sending to Africa?

Can he just have one of those?

Claire, Brendan, this guy's got a 250 credit score.

We're bringing everybody out?

Look at this.

Oh, I'm sorry. I've been doing this a long time.

I've just never seen a score this low.

Did you just wake up from a coma?

âª Who's that girl? âª âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess. âª

But you've always wanted a thing.

This could be your thing, like, the guy with no phone.

Well, who is that guy?

I don't want to be that guy.

No, no, no, it's like mysterious.

It's like,

"I want to call Nick Miller."

"You can't;

He doesn't have a phone."

"What?!"

You can go all Ghost Protocol on everyone.

See, that's cool.

I mean, I always wanted to be a mole person.

Schmidt, you're the Michael Jordan of bar trivia.

We were in the Greek mythology zone.

I mean, you knew every question.

Perseus, Icarus, Medusa...

Medeuce, deuce!

Guys, you're shouting.

I mean, you knew every answer.

Like, what was the tiebreaker you got?

Calvin Coolidge's birthplace?

Little Plymouth Notch, son.

Wow, I'm done with this. Hey, Shelby...

I mean, seriously, how did you know that?

How do you forget that?

You don't.

Jar!

I'm gonna jar myself on that one.

He's like a trivia god.

Girl, get up.

Winston, don't worry about it, man.

It's your public school education.

You'll catch up.

Jar again.

Excuse me?

Oh, hi.

Yeah, hi, hi, I'm Russell Schiller, Sarah's dad.

Oh, yes.

We spoke on the phone.

I'm Jessica Day.

Did you just curtsy?

I did, yes; I did.

Is this a bad time?

Nope, no, no, no, I was just cleaning up from the sexual health class.

I had to take condoms off 30 cucumbers, and condoms are harder to take off than I thought.

I know how to put them on, but I didn't know how to take them off.

I guess someone else has always done it for me.

Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got off a flight from London.

Maybe I'm a little out of it.

Oh, London.

Did you have a busy sch...

Se-dule?

Did you have fun?

No, I was advising a merger.

Oh, fair enough.

Um, you wanted to talk to me about Sarah's art.

So, this is one of the pieces she did.

Um...

That one's called, um,

"At the Mall with Grandma."

She made that in dream-cess, which is where, um, I let the kids have time to create something.

Sarah's gonna be opting out of dream-cess from now on.

She'll use that same time to review her other schoolwork with a tutor.

Oh, did you talk to Sarah about this?

Well, I don't need to.

I want her to know fractions before she goes to high school.

Well, I follow the curriculum.

My daughter is wearing doll's heads around her neck, so whatever you're doing, keep it up.

Okay, I talk to your daughter every single day.

Do you? Because hiring a tutor is not the same thing as spending time with her.

I'm her father, not her friend.

I know what she needs.

Give my best to Mrs. Monogamy.

Cheerio.

He's the third largest donor in the city.

We take his money and then what, we have to answer to him?

So, you're asking me to give up my integrity?

That's what I'm telling you to do.

Yes, we need his money.

So, he pulls his donation.

You know what? I'll raise the money myself.

I'll get a ragtag group of kids together.

A lost soul, an orphan, a Jewish kid with a keyboard, a little slut who can dance, and one fatso, and I'll choreograph some dances, make a show.

You did that already, Jess.

It's called the spring musical, and it literally brought in $60.

Please don't make me apologize.

You're gonna go to his office.

You're gonna say that you were wrong.

Say you're never gonna let the kids do anything creative ever again.

From now on, your classroom is full-on North Korea:

Math! Math! Math!

Make sure he doesn't pull the donation.

When he was yelling at you, did do that little thing with his mouth?

You know, that little smile thing?

You know, like, like where he goes, "Mmm"?

That's really weird, Tanya.

Apologize.

Why did you make me look stupid in front of Shelby last nigh? - Wait, what?

Which of the five great lakes is located entirely in the United States?

Lake Erie?

Yeah, if Lake Michigan didn't exist and we won a fictional U.S.-Canada w*r.

Lake Michigan.

Correct!

Oh, you want me to take a dive next time?

Take a dive?

You know, like pretend like you know more than me when Shelby's around, so it seems like you're smarter.

I know you'd do the same thing for me if I were the dumber one.

Wow, okay, so let me get this straight:

You think because you know a few facts about Princess Kate, that makes you smarter than me?

First of all, Kate is a duchess and whip-smart by all accounts.

And second of all, don't be so prideful.

Look, man, there's nothing wrong with being the second smartest in the loft.

You know what, let me take that back.

Jess is a teacher of children.

You memorize facts.

I can memorize facts.

That doesn't make you smart.

Okay, well, maybe, but I'm definitely smarter than you.

Whew! Glutes are done, my man.

I'm gonna go to the stairwell, work on my calves. Come with?

Hell, no.

You sure?

I have to grovel.

I hate groveling.

I would have lasted two seconds in the court of the Sun King.

I think about that all the time.

You do?

Do you know how much I grovel on a daily basis?

It is literally obscene.

Come the weekend, I'm the one who's filling up my cart with Fila, Nautica, Impulse Fila, Hilfiger, CK, BR Leather cuff, and more Fila.

This is the problem, Jess.

It's rich people.

We are right where they want us, Jess:

Just suckling on the teat of consumerism.

Yeah. - That's the exact reason I got rid of my phone.

You were denied a cell phone because you have the credit score of a homeless ghost.

How I got here doesn't matter.

You weigh more than your credit score.

I'm here now, and I'm loving it.

Yeah.

I'm the guy with no phone.

I mean, right now, I'm writing a letter to my friend, Kev, seeing if he wants to party with me this Friday.

"What up, Kev?

"You in?

Nick Miller."

Yeah, Nick, he might pull the funding from the school, so I'm just a little bit...

Blame your period.

I've actually done this before.

I mean, both parties knew that I was lying, obviously, but it didn't matter because they knew that I had utterly humiliated myself, and at the end of the day, they respected that.

I'm sorry; I just feel like someone should suggest a simple apology.

I know that's not where we're headed here, but I'm just gonna go on record and say, I think you should apologize like a human.

No!

No! I'm going with Nick

'cause I don't think I have to apologize.

Yeah, Jess, so march into his office, and say, "Hey, Mr. Fancyman, you can't tell me what to do.

"Your money doesn't own me."

And then throw away your phone.

Yeah, I'm gonna throw my phone into the fiery chasm where he keeps his poor people.

Actually, scratch that.

My mom's got your number in case of emergency.

I want her to think that I can bring something to the table.

I care about this girl, Elvin.

I want her to be my girlfriend.

She sees me, all she sees is a part-time nanny, and that's...

You are a part-time nanny.

I want her to think I'm smart.

What about fake glasses?

It worked for me.

Okay, okay, I'm on my way to his office, and I have a speech I wrote for Fancyman, and I want to practice it.

Why are you listening to Nick?

It is a horrible idea.

Ghost Protocol, man.

You're using my phone.

It's not Ghost Protocol.

It's you using my phone.

This is a group call; I'm just talking in my living room, and it happens to go into that box.

Okay, I'm gonna start with a quote against social Darwinism, then a discussion of the Gilded Age, the robber barons, the Great Society, how we ended up with a huge wealth disparity in this country, and then, I end with a bluegrass version of Public Enemy's

"Fight the Power."

Bad finish.

What is that?

Are you driving a lawn mower?

No, I just...

It's my car.

Look, this is a great opportunity.

You need to ask yourself, where are you even going?

Buy a new car.

You don't need a car.

Oh, my car's stalled out.

Can you guys come and help me push it?

Yeah, we'll be down in a few minutes.

Hey, can I help you?

What? Oh, hi.

Um, Uh, Mr. Schiller, um, how'd you know I was here?

I was driving by and I saw you.

My office is right here.

Oh, oh, what a coincidence.

I had no idea.

Weird.

What's wrong with the car?

Guy sounds like matinee idol.

Shut up, Schmidt.

I'm just pushing it to the nearest gas station.

It's like, a mile away, so I'm fine.

I know a guy;

He'll be here in ten.

Oh, no, Mr. Schiller.

Russell.

Mr. Schiller, I can take care of myself.

It's how I was raised;

I wasn't raised with money, so when something broke, we pretended it still worked.

Some of my best memories are pushing this car around on family vacations.

Okay.

Oh, yeah, tow truck's on the way.

Look, that's very nice and generous of you, but I really... I-I mean, I need my car, and...

Here, let me help you.

Take mine.

What?

Take mine.

Here.

No.

Come on. Take mine.

Uh, I don't know how to drive cars that work.

You can drop it off tomorrow night.

I'm having a party, a cookout.

Come on over any time. Come on.

Thank you so much.

This is amazing.

I will return it washed and polished.

Do you think it's a superhero?

No.

I think it's Jess and some weird guy.

Miss Day?

Jess ... you can call me Jess.

Great, I'll see you tomorrow, Jess.

Go is the one on the right.

The one on the left is stop.

Thanks.

What kind of car is it?

We are the 99%.

Is it an SL?

We the 99%.

Does it have a push ignition?

Does it have a push ignition?

Please tell me it's not a hybrid.

And then he gives me his car, just hands me the keys.

It's like so...

Rich people! They're always giving you their cars.

It's like, let them eat cars.

You know what he's doing?

He's taking back the power, so I have to go to his cookout, and instead of standing up to him, I have to grovel.

Just a thought:

What if he likes you? No, I hate him.

This guy is single and he's sweet.

Sweet? No.

He's not sweet.

I would never go for that guy.

Why?

Because he's the type of guy who has a linen closet and a towel warmer.

You know me.

I'm only attracted to guys who are afraid of success and think someone famous stole their idea.

I like an underdog.

Spencer didn't even own sheets.

Yeah. He slept on a pile of washcloths.

Can I say something to you now that you're not gonna like?

Yeah. - Maybe Russell intimidates you.

Because you wouldn't have to take care of him, because he would take care of you, and that just terrifies you.

Uh, no.

Spencer... wore... jellies.

How many pounds in a metric ton?

2,204.6. Next.

In 1948, Albert became the first...

American...American monkey in space.

Let's go.

This ancient...

Mesopotamia. h*t me.

You don't actually know what a Mesopotamia is.

Of course I know what Mesopotamia is. Don't be crazy.

Use it in a sentence.

Look, there's Mesopotamia.

So I'm going to have to draw on your hatred of rich people for this, okay?

Hate me up.

Well, for starters, look at this place.

I know. Ugh.

I'm betting at one point there was a moat.

Rich boy punk.

This hallway's excessive. It's braggy.

Well, I guess everyone's out back.

Ugh, look at this place, Jess. Are you kidding me?

It's so over-the-top.

A kitchen island? Be a man!

Let your counter attach to itself.

I know.

It's like, I can't chop vegetables over here.

I need to do it over here. Love me, love me.

I mean, we're making an egg, not going to outer space, guys, right?

Right. Nice burn.

Whoa.

Makes me want to sit by the f*re, and talk about how annoying Gandhi is.

Whoa, something's happening to me, Jess.

I want to sit at that desk and veto a law.

What are you doing, Nick?

That's someone else's stuff.

Jess, when I put my hand on this desk, I feel sexually proficient for the first time in my life.

Nick, this man stands for everything you hate.

I'm President Miller! You're all fired!

Bring our boys home.

Okay, this is how evil geniuses are born.

You smell that? It smells like leather and Teddy Roosevelt and wistfulness.

I want to wear this cap.

You're not helping me!

Nick, I know this room is beautiful, gentlemanly, and... smells like Christmas, but you have to stay strong.

I'm gonna go find Russell.

Keep... playing with that duck.

I want to k*ll you.

Because I respect you.

I think I understand hunting!

Hello, Russell.

Hey, Jess. Thanks for coming.

Oh, the mechanic called. Your car's done.

He also wanted me to communicate to you that you need to change your oil.

I want to, first of all, say thank you, Russell.

Um, and second of all, I want to say, um, I know you donate a lot of money to this school, but...

You think I'm a snob.

No. No.

No, I have nothing against people who...

live in enormous mansions.

Jess, I'm 42.

I've made a lot of money, and I enjoy spending it.

Oh, you've got to try one of these. - Oh.

Deconstructed spring roll.

It's delicious.

Oh.

Try it.

Oh.

Oh, my God!

This is so amazing I want to punch you!

Russell! Russell.

Come tell Carolyn about that time you delivered that baby.

Oh. Yeah.

You delivered a baby? Just... it was twins, actually.

Twins?

Are you wearing my sweater?

No. Yes. It was on the back of the chair.

So I thought the sweater belonged to the chair.

I thought it was a chair sweater.

Those exist.

I'm Nick.

Oh, you know Jess.

Yes.

I'm Jess' roommate. I'm the guy with no phone, if she's told you. That's my thing.

No phones.

Why don't you have a phone?

Because I don't want to be tied to some corporate system.

That, and no one would give me one.

I have incredibly low credit ratings.

Yeah.

When I was your age, I had a really skinny ponytail, and I think I was living off of selling my own blood.

That's funny. Then what happened?

One day you just woke up and you had all this?

Well, I realized I wanted to grow up.

That's what happened.


Um... I got this as a gift from the company for Christmas, so...

Oh, wow, that's great.

My boss gave me three credit cards he found at the bar, and said, "You didn't get these from me."

It's a bartender joke. I'm a bartender. We...

We don't steal credit cards. Cool, cool.

Here. Take it. No, no, I can't take your phone, man.

I can't... it's just... it feels really good in my hand.

Is it possible to be sexually attracted to an object?

Yes, it is. It really is.

You can keep the sweater.

Thanks, I... I don't know why I put it on, to be honest with you.

I just came in here, and it smelled like Shakespeare, if Shakespeare were a damn cowboy.

And hawk's nests, and boat fuel, and cigars and burping... man stuff!

Yeah, yeah, enjoy it.

Thank you.

Yeah.

I appreciate you.

Yeah, yeah. Sure.

Hey, Russell, why are you being so nice to me?

Well, you're Jess's friend, right?

Now, you fold that sweater.

Don't hang it.

You listening to me? Fold it.

Ah, I don't care. Do whatever you want.

That was really funny, man!

Why did I...?

Bidet!

Bidet if I do.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my gosh. Shut up.

Jess, is that you?

Oh, God! Oh, God.

What's wrong?

Sorry, Jess. I'm coming in.

Oh, my God.

What's going on?

Oh, my God! I just...

Wait, wait, wait.

Ow! - No, I just pressed some buttons with cartoon characters on them.

Yeah, it's Japanese.

Of course it's a Japanese bidet.

Of course you have a Japanese bidet.

Look, Russell, I want to tell you that I am not sorry about what I said because Sara is 12, and she is creative, and I don't care if you pull your donation, I am not gonna grovel...

Why did you think I was going to pull the donation? I would never do that.

Okay.

Oh, jeez.

It is some really deep cleaning here.

Oh, God.

No, Jess, Jess!

Wait!

Oh!

Jess, you put it up to six happy faces.

I've never gone past three.

Jess, why are we leaving?

And why are you all wet?

Okay, did you take a bath in his tub because you wanted to see what it'd feel like to be him?

'Cause, weirdly, I get that.

No. I want to leave because we don't fit in here, Nick.

I know that I've been saying you can't give into this guy, but I don't think that you should run from him, either.

'Cause no matter where you go, he could find you.

I believe that.

No, running's good. I'm gonna run.

Hey, Jess, stop.

Look, this may complicate things, but I'm in love with him.

Shut up! No, I won't shut up.

He smells like strong coffee and going to see a man about a horse.

You're ridiculous, Nick. Let's go.

I am ridiculous, okay, but no.

Be a grown-up.

He likes you, Jess.

Go back in there.

I think it'd be good for you.

And I'm not just saying that because I'm in love with him.

Just do it.

Don't be intimidated just because you're just younger, poorer and wetter than everybody in there.

Goldfinger! I mean, no, no.

I meant to say Golden-Golden Hind!

Golden Hind is what I meant to say.

No...

Winston, you are all over the place.

The Green Bay Packers did not invent the T formation, nor was Crispin Glover the first man to die in the Revolutionary w*r.

Shh.

This is supposed to be fun.

Look, Babe, it is fun.

I just don't want to look stupid in front of everybody.

All right?

You're not stupid.

Well, I mean, he did skip Earth when listing the planets.

What has gotten into you today?

I just... I just didn't want you to think I was an idiot.

You tried to memorize all the trivia answers? Winston!

I don't want some smart, rich guy who owns his own car.

I want to be with you.

I don't care if you don't know Ernest Hemingway's birthplace.

Oak Park, Illinois.

So, what are you saying?

Are we doing this? Is this real?

Like, are you my girlfriend?

Because if that's what you're saying, then that would make me very happy.

Mm, me, too.

Shelby, be careful with his mustache, please.

Mmm.

It's very delicate.

I can't watch this anymore.

Winston, I hope you're better in bed because your street work is embarrassing.

Am I talking too much? I don't want to ruin the moment.

You know what? If this was my grandmother's building, she'd be outside on the patio, and she'd be yelling down at you, and she'd be saying,

"You look beautiful.

"The two of you are a beautiful couple.

I'm glad you found one another."

But she wouldn't invite you up because she's a horrible r*cist.

You want me to put on some Jodeci?

There you are. I was looking for you.

Okay...

Listen.

Uh-huh.

I'm not used to people who have it all together.

I think... you scare me.

Oh, no, no, I don't...

I don't have it all together.

I don't even know how to talk to my own kid.

I can't even remember the last time she hugged me and used both arms.

She said she wanted to go bra shopping, and so I bought her a ski vest.

Look, every eye roll means you're doing something right.

Really?

No, that's just what I tell parents to make them feel better.

Jess, will you have dinner with me?

Yes.

Great. Good.

Sh-Should I, um, text you, or...?

No. I'll call.

Great.

Okay, cool.

All right, cool.

Oh, no... Hey, Jess.

Jess, why are you in the koi pond?!

Jess, are you okay?

Oh, God, oh, God.

Okay, come here.

Oh, God!

Koi in my dress!

Let me help you.

Koi in my dress!

Are you all right?

Oh, you got a fish in your dress.

I didn't ask you! I'm talking to you!

You want to come in here and charge me a billion dollars?

That's nothing to me!

Want it? Want it?

You're off the streets.

I don't want to, either.

You're the best cop I got!

As President Miller of Earth, I'd like to speak to the Galactic Emperor, please.

Yeah, it's about money.

I'm gonna push a piece of paper across the desk that I've written a little number on.

Why don't I just tell you? It's five kabillion dollars.

So, what do you say?

Is China mine, Mr. Ying?

SCHMIDT: Here? You're dropping me off here?

R-Right in front of this obvious pickpocket?

Look at the size of that guy.

He's clearly new homeless.

We're a mile away from the loft, Cece.

I'm not getting caught with you.

I'm gonna have to run all the way home.

And I have my slippiest loafers on.

If I were you, I would get walking right now.

You're never gonna get home before dawn.

Okay, look, I'm fine with you not telling anybody about us, but you cannot just call me at anytime and just summon me for intercourse.

I have no control here, and I'm stressed out all day long.

It's like you're ripping the side block out of my mental Jenga.

I'm totally falling apart.

Okay, Schmidt, you...

you really need to learn to take a breath and calm down, all right?

We're just being a little spontaneous.

Words that have never been used to describe Schmidt:

"spontaneous, flexible, easy-going."

I'm like a Marine.

You're nothing like a Marine.

I'm totally like a Marine, all right? You know what? Fine...

I'm... I'm out of here.

Take these, and take care of them ... I can get a tetanus sh*t, but I can't cure damaged suede.

JESS:

Can you believe

I found this on the street?

Who would want to throw this away?

A blind man who suddenly recovered his sight?

Get rid of it, Jess ... pine has no place in this loft.

It's the wood of poor people and outhouses.

I pay rent, so I think that gives me the right to add a few things. - Jess...

(chuckles)

you're wrong.

Okay?

My answer's no.

Well, my answer is yes.

I'm keeping the hutch.

I had a bad night.

I'm really, I'm just asking you, please d-don't push me.

'Cause then I'll have to reinstate my ban on high-waisted shorts.

You would not dare.

Try me.

That was the worst four weeks of my life.

âª Hey, girl âª
âª What you doing? âª
âª Hey, girl âª
âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

Hey, Winston, why are you still drinking?

It is 10:00 in the morning, man.

Yeah, I know what it'll feel like when I stop, so I'm just gonna stay a little drunk, forever.

Well, why is there no girl version of you, my man? (groans)

Moving on.

So, last night's poker game.

Got pretty intense.

I don't even know what you're talking about ...

I was so hammered last night.

I've never been more sober in my whole life.

I'll remember this as long as I live.

I'm all in. Uno, bitches.

Read 'em and weep.

Straight flush.

Aw!

So, what do I owe you, 20 bucks?

20 bucks?

Yeah.

You owe me $487.

Come on, Winston!

Aah! Schmidt makes me so mad!

I want to put one thing, one thing in the living room, and he won't let me.

I'm not putting up with this.

Oh, yes, you are.

We live in a fragile ecosystem.

It's a delicate balance.

It's a broken ecosystem, dominated by an apex predator.

Chill out, Jess.

We let him run the house, no big deal.

The boy cooks and cleans ... and happily, I might add.

Yeah, he probably couldn't sleep last night

'cause he was so excited to clean up after us.

I know he's been bad lately, but...

Schmidt's an odd bird.

He can't handle it when things aren't clean and orderly.

It's been that way since the day he moved in.

Welcome to your new home, Schmidt.

Come on, play ball.

(whooping, laughing)

Coming home!

(gagging)

Well, I'm fed up with it.

And he's got to learn how to relax.

And, Nick, why do you have...

cannons drawn all over your back?

Those aren't cannons, Jess.

Long-stem mushrooms?

Nope.

Oh, so that's...

not a mossy cave.

Mm-mm.

Mmm, no.

Probably not.

(door opens)

What the...?

What is happening...?

I can't take this right now.

What, do we live in a pawnshop?

Hey, Schmidt.

(chuckles): Hey, Jess. What, uh...

Where did all this come from?

I found the afghan underneath a Dumpster outside an animal shelter.

And I found the lamp underneath the afghan.

I'm gonna assume that these are your spices jammed in here with my spices.

Yep.

I would really appreciate it if your non-Tahitian vanilla was not touching my Tahitian vanilla.

Oh, Schmidt, they're more than touching.

(breathy voice): What's it like living in the most populous isle in French Polynesia?

(French accent): I could tell you, or... I could show you.

(breathy voice): Not in front of the cloves.

Where's my burr coffee grinder?

Oh, you know, I think it's in the hutch.

You put it in the hutch?

The... aah, this thing was on the street.

It's a coffee grinder, Schmidt.

I think it'll be okay.

A top-of-the-line conical burr coffee grinder.

You know what that means? It means it doesn't smash up the beans like some pedestrian blade grinder.

It actually grinds them, for a deeper, richer, more satisfying flavor profile!

Oh. Well, I've used it repeatedly to make homemade crayons.

Does that show up in your flavor profile, Schmidt?

Uh, yeah, that's fine.

If you're looking for your oven mitts, they're in the top drawer of the hutch.

(chuckles):

Oh. Okay, fair enough.

Hutch is gone.

No.

No, no, no.

No. - No hutch.

No, no!

Stop! Don't move the hutch.

Bye-bye, hutch!

This thing makes me emotionally nauseous!

This is my hutch. Don't move it!

All right, you're right, you're right...

I'm so sorry. You're right.

It's a beautiful piece.

It looks great there.

My apologies.

Thank you.

Oops.

Schmidt, you have a real problem.

You've got to learn to calm down.

Yeah, yeah.

I love the beach.

Now, isn't this better than arguing about a hutch?

Yeah, if you like hanging out on the rim of a giant fish toilet.

Jess, I can't believe you brought me down here.

This is a great place to talk about your problems.

Jess, this sucks ... I just want to go home.

Schmidt, come here.

Look. You got the birds in the sky.

Sea and sand.

The wind in our hair.

(grunts)

You've lost your kite!

Have fun flying your string all day!

Sorry I forgot my wallet.

Thank you for paying;

It's delicious.

Yeah, which is weird, because I clearly remember saying,

"Hey, man, don't forget your wallet."

And then I still forgot it.

You still forget it. Wow, it's weird.

Yeah, you said that. We're getting older.

Yeah, I said that.

Okay, this is a good segue.

(sighs):

Um...

can I talk to you about something that's kind of tough?

(sighs)

Yeah, man, sh**t.

"The subject of this talk is the debt of money between us.

I feel that..."

Oh, man!

I thought this was about something serious.

You set that up like it was about something different.

This is about the poker?

Oh, I'll pay you your money. Relax.

"If I am reading this section, then I can only assume

"you have told me to relax.

You wrote that?

"Let me assure you I am very relaxed,

"although I have good reason not to be,

"as you owe me a very large sum."

I will pay you the money, you clown.

"I am aware that we're both broke,

"one of us embarrassingly so. Points to Nick.

"I have recently tumbled down the socioeconomic ladder

"and have h*t rock bottom,

"where you, Nick Miller, Thank you.

"Have been waiting patiently for the past 15 years.

"But I want that money.

"Give me my money. I really mean it.

"It's my money. You owe me that money,

"so give me my money. Seriously.

Are you finished?

"Where is the money, dude?

You wrote "dude"?

"But I am not without pity.

I am willing to just call it an even $200."

Everything let go with just $200?

Right.

All right, I can do $200.

$200? Two hundo clean?

Yep.

All right.

I did pay for gas here, though.

So that's, let's say, ten bucks.

So we're at $190.

We'll say clean $190.

I hate to be this guy...

but I got the fights on Friday, so that's $30. So let's call it $160

and be done with it.

$20 for beer that night, so $160 takes us to $140.

Just to be fair.

And I didn't write a stupid letter about it.

But let's say right now $140.

You ate a lot of the nachos!

Littering!

$15 for littering!

âª What a way to live... âª

How fun is this!

It's not my cup of tea.

âª Don't you know that life âª
âª Don't wait for death? âª
âª Choo-choo âª

(whistle bl*ws)

(screams)

No!

No! No, Jess, no!

I can't believe I never noticed this before, but, Schmidt, you are legitimately crazy.

I think we're all a little bit crazy, don't you think, Jess?

No, I mean, you're like aging-

ballerina, child-chess-prodigy, professional-magician crazy.

It's my mom's fault ... you know, I come from a Jewish family, but she used to tell me the reason Santa didn't come to our house was because my room was dirty.

The only thing I ever controlled was what I ate.

That's why I got fat.

Yeah, I got fat 'cause I used to eat Concord grape jelly from the jar using a candy bar as a fork.

It's because you didn't have any structure.

You know what I mean? That's what happens when you don't have any rules.

None of these people have rules. Especially that guy.

He's wearing ladies'

bikini bottoms.

SCHMIDT: Jess, I'm not like these people, okay?

I don't have dreadlocks. I don't own a snake.

And I don't understand how these people think that they're relaxed, because they're not ... they just have nothing to do.

That's not me. It's not that easy for me.

Sounds to me like a lot of excuses, Schmidt.

Just be spontaneous.

(rhythmic percussion playing)

Hey, Nick.

Look, man, I'm sorry to bother you while you're clearly sitting here working hard making lots of money.

All right. - But if you'd kindly just pause that for one second, I have a few accounts that I'd like to settle.

Account number one:

A $15 receipt for a Chinatown box turtle.

Bam. Here we go.

We're doing this, huh?

Yeah, we are doing this. - Great Item number two:

Cancelled $35 check for registration of a domain name ...

"It's Nick Miller Time.com."

"Hey, guys, Winston, I got a good idea, man.

I'm gonna be a big-time blogger."

I have to go to work...

Uh-huh.

...At a bar, where

you drink for free.

Wow.

How much does four hundred cognac and colas add up to, Winston?

You want to go there?

Yeah.

Okay. How about all the times I sat around listening to you bitch and moan about how Caroline broke your precious little heart?

Okay, in eighth grade...

Eighth grade.

...You "accidentally" saw my mom naked. - Mm-hmm.

Before she stopped exercising and let herself get chubby.

(laughs)

Okay?

So how much is that, in terms of money?

'Cause I haven't gotten over that.

And I would say four to $5,000.


Hey, guys. Hey, guys.

Schmidt, Winston saw my mother naked in eighth grade; in terms of mon ...

I waded into the ocean without my aqua socks.

JESS:

Mm, he did.

He let go.

(drumming, chanting)

He washed his hands in a public restroom.

And there was a man in there.

And he was using the toilet, full sit, no door.

And I didn't break eye contact.

Not once.

That's not letting go, that's cruising.

Hey, Schmidt.

There's a spill.

I know.

Do your exercise. You know.

Yeah, okay, the exercise.

(clears throat)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

I feel great.

I'm gonna go take a shower with Nick's bar soap, like a common ranch hand.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - What is going on?

You messed with the ecosystem.

And you guys said it couldn't be done.

You have no idea what you're getting into.

You're welcome.

JESS: Schmidt, you're k*lling

with me with that drumming!

(rhythmic drumming, Jess moans)

JESS: You're k*lling me!

Look at this mess. How did this happen?

So, this is your fault.

No. No.

This is good for Schmidt.

'Cause you guys have been taking advantage of him for years.

You make him cook, you make him clean...

Where's my money, dude?

Frankly, it's... sexist.

Oh, my God. Ew!

How's it sexist?

Who's cleaning up?

I cleaned this morning.

All right, fine.

I'll clean, you guys go to the store.

Act like an adult.

BOTH: I'm not going to the store with him.

Where's my money, dude...?

Stop throwing things at each other.

JESS: Oh, come on. WINSTON: Where is the money?

You're a child.

...My car, too, while you...

SCHMIDT:

Silence, friends!

I made you necklaces.

Hey, do you want to go to the store?

Please, God, yes.

$100? How did Schmidt buy all these groceries with 100 bucks?

It's only $100?

$100.

You should've told... we have way too much stuff, man.

Yeah, like shrimp cocktail.

We don't need a baked ham.

All right.

Winston?

Sorry about that.

Really? Really?

Two cake mixes?

Really? All these soups?

Pizza? Frozen pizza?

You fat ass. What are you trying to do, die? Shut up, dude.

We have enough ketchup. We have enough ketchup! Come on, really?

Next, please.

Oh, hey, how you doing, sir?

We only have $100, Gary, so could you stop checking us out when we h*t $100?

Yeah, you got to include tax, too, so, like, $93, just... Cool?

Yeah, just that'll do.

Okay, guys.

Thanks. - I'm gonna put my stuff at the front,

'cause you obviously don't know how to shop. - You're being ridiculous.

Are you getting me?

We have enough ketchup.

(chuckling)

Epsom salt?

Yeah, okay. - What, are you too good for regular salt?

You know damn well I got to soak my trick foot.

Oh, Winnie, your little trick foot.

Yeah, my trick foot, and don't ever call me Winnie.

Aw, Winnie...

Fine.

You don't owe me anything.

The slate is clean. We're good, we're even.

Oh, good, that's how I feel, too.

Because in my mind, your mom will always be the winner of Best Boobs.

Really, Best Boobs?

Yeah. Master's Division.

You're gonna talk about my mother?

You're gonna talk about my mom's boobs?

Is that... you gonna go there?

Don't push me in a supermarket, man.

You started this.

Did you just slap me in the face?

No, I did not.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I'm not afraid of you, man.

Don't act your...

(grunting)

NICK:

Grow up, dude!

(singing to himself)

Hey, Schmidt.

Oh, hello, Jess.

Hey.

What are you doing out here?

Oh, just checking up on you.

Oh, I see you're eating street meat wrapped in street meat.

This is my man, Gordon.

You've outdone yourself once again, Gordon.

Excellent.

Did you go to work today?

No, no. No work.

I haven't been there in a while.

How long is a while?

I don't know. Three days?

Schmidt, I made a mistake in bringing you down here.

I shouldn't have done that.

Please come home.

Why?

So I can cook and clean?

So I can show you where the vacuum is?

WOMAN: All right.

(drumming starts)

Okay, fine, I don't know where the vacuum is.

That is one reason why I came here, but I really want you to come home.

Everything's falling apart without you.

Nick and Winston are fighting all the time.

And all of us lost our keys to the mailbox.

Schmidt, just listen to me, because you don't belong here, like, really.

Do you remember when you got yourself off to An Inconvenient Truth?

How about when you dress up like Shia Labeouf from

Wall Street Two for Halloween?

Do you remember when you said jazz music was America's greatest mistake?

Say it in drums, Jessica Day.

Me hablo drums.

Hey, man.

I got the last frozen thing.

I was gonna ice my wrist, but...

How about this?

Take half, pal.

So kind of you.

(chuckling)

That hurts, man.

(sighs)

I am so hungry.

Remember those things that Schmidt used to make us with the peanut butter and the raisins on the celery?

What were those called?

Ants on a log.

Ants on a log.

I just got why they're called ants on a log.

Looks like ants on a log.

(door closes)

I'm hungry, man.

Hey, Schmidt, is that you, buddy?

No, it's me.

What the hell happened to you?

I went down to the beach, and I tried to talk to Schmidt, but he just ignored me, and he went back to twirling his f*re baton.

He's really bad;

He b*rned a lot of people.

I feel like they should let you twirl it around a few times before they actually light it on f*re.

Well, look, Jess, being friends with Schmidt is really complicated.

'Cause you want to change him so badly, but you can't

'cause he'll just get worse.

You guys were right, I upset the ecosystem.

(sniffles)

This is not what I wanted.

I just wanted to put my hutch here.

Make the place my own, be a part of the family.

What family? With these clowns?

Yeah, you clowns.

Well, look, you want in, you're in.

Congratulations, welcome to the family, Jess.

Aww.

Yeah, we don't "aww"

in this family.

(door unlocking)

(mumbling)

Hey, guys.

Hey, Schmidt.

Um, we need to talk.

Something not cool?

Schmidt, we miss you.

You just want me to clean.

No, that's not true.

Well, it's a little bit true.

There's truth to that.

Okay, look. I want you to clean.

Look, we're so proud of you for letting go, and relaxing.

But this isn't like you.

You can run away from your problems, but you're just gonna find new ones that pop up like hepatitis.

And Nick and Winston want to say to you that they really miss you.

You're freaking me out, man.

Why are you wearing that crystal around your neck?

Nick, the crystal symbolizes energy.

All a crystal is is rock poo, Schmidt.

Look, I need you, Schmidt.

Okay, I need you to tell me what pants not to wear and to exercise more often.

I need you to make fun of me when I call a panini a hot sandwich;

How am I ever gonna learn?

WINSTON:

I even miss your hair chutney.

Without you, man, we're just three idiots who live together.

(sighs)

You make us a family.

(chuckling) Well, I'm the cool rebel brother.

You're the mom. - The mother. - Mom.

NICK: Look, Schmidt, if you come back to us, I'll let you clean my room.

The white whale?

Think about how many dust bunnies are under my bed.

How many stray socks.

JESS:

Hey, Schmidt, I got you something.

Is that a boutique box?

A pair of gray, shiny, twill, flat-front trousers designed by a man named Calvin.

Never been tried on.

Pockets are sewn shut.

Don't you just want to get your thumbs in there and rip?

Okay, so, I'm just gonna leave this on your bongo drum, and you can, you know, give them a whirl if you feel like it.

Just make the right decision.

(whispering)

Come home.

Take the pants.

(clears throat)

(sighs)

Oh, come here.

(sighs)

(chuckling)

Calvin.

You magnificent wizard.

(water running, dishes clattering)

Scmidtty.

Nick, your hair is doing that thing that I just... I just hate.

And Jess, can you please ask Winston to help you move the furniture out? He could use the exercise.

You're looking a little, you know... (sputters)

He's back.

And Nick, Winston, we have a urinal.

How are you still missing?

(door closes)

CECE: Schmidt?

Schmidt, wake up.

Hey, hey.

Hey.

Hey!

(both screaming)

What...

are you doing here?

What do you think I'm doing here? Come on!

Okay, wait, wait, wait.

What?

Cece, before we continue, I clearly have no control in this relationship, and... I'm fine with it.

Good.

But know this, you're the one who broke into this apartment at 3:00 a.m.

for a little bit of this Schmidt, so who's really in control?

Shut up!

(sighing)

Wait, oh, are you sleeping in dress pants?

What? They're slacks.

What's the big deal? Calm down. - Oh...

SCHMIDT: Look how excited Hector J. is to see you.

CECE: Yeah, I've already met Hector J., so...

Ooh, look, he's knighting you.

Oh, no, please stop knighting me.

Don't...

Lady Cecelia...

No, Schmidt, I'm gonna leave.

You have entered the order of the round table.

I'm getting my bag, okay, I'm gonna get my...

Oh, I want to stay.

Dame Nasty Cece.

Nick, go out ten yards, cut left.

Winston, go long, post right.

Jess, go down, out towards the parking lot.

Get in the car. We'll meet you back at the loft.

Oh, very funny. You're a comedian, Schmidt.

Hike!

Schmidt! Come on!

(groaning)

Oh! WINSTON: Did you see that?

Are you okay?

Yes, I'm oka ... (groaning)

What is going on?

JESS: Nick... Nick, I'm so sorry.

(groans) Oh, my God!

This is real!

Probably your lateral sizer.

Shut up!

Can you just...

Okay, let's go. (screams)

Rotator cuff? JESS: Can I...?

What do you need?

Nothing from you.

Please go far from me right now.

I can taste my spine.

Three or four down there ... vertebrae.

Why is no one helping me?

Not you! Not you!

âª Hey, girl âª
âª What you doing? âª
âª Hey, girl âª
âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

(groaning)

Are you sure you're okay?

You're walking like a Disney witch.

Let me drive you to your doctor.

I don't have a doctor.

I don't have insurance.

Nick, you need to see a doctor, if only to make sure that your junk is clean.

I don't go to doctors. JESS: I'll take you to my friend Sadie.

She'll just look at you ... she won't charge you.

Okay, I don't go to doctors!

Are you sure you're okay driving?

Yes, I'm fine. I've never been better.

I'm great.

Thank you.

(engine starting)

I feel better already.

See you guys back at the loft.

(crashing)

Oh, my God!

Oh!

What did you just...?! NICK: I'm okay.

I'm okay. Don't worry. WINSTON: Oh! What did you do?

(groaning)

You h*t my car!

I'm okay.

(Winston groans)

Oh, Winston, relax.

Okay? Relax.

That's all I did. I did this.

The rest was already there.

Actually, I think I undid a dent there.

I'm taking you to see my friend. Get in my car.

No... Jess, no. Oh!

Now!

So she's fitting us in between patients.

(Nick groans)

Jess?

Is Sadie a gynecologist?

No, she's an OB/GYN.

(groans)

I'm going to go.

It's a different thing.

I'm going to get out of here, actually, I think.

Yeah? I don't think you are.

(groaning)

Nick, she's a wizard with a speculum.

Nick!

I don't have a vag*na.

You can take mine.

(chuckles)

(laughs)

I heard that, sister.

True dat.

(Nick groaning)

Okay, you know what, Nick?

I'm sorry that my only doctor friend is a gynecologist, but you're broke, so you're going to have to shut your mouth, and you're going to tag the things that you want in this Lucky magazine.

We're gonna have to put this baby to bed. - No.

No, no, no, Sherman, look, uh, I don't think you understand, man.

This car's been with me through everything, so... if you could just fix it.

This is not really officially a car anymore.

You didn't even buy the thing ... it was given to you as an illegal recruitment gift from a college you didn't even go to.

Things happened in this car.

Like what?

Desert Storm?

Oh, things happened.

Is this your car?

Yeah.

Cool.

Any time.

It's time for you to buy a new car, man.

You buy a new car!

I bought a new car.

It's what you borrow every morning when this one makes the weird sound.

(imitates squealing, moaning engine)

That's not a good sound.

Just give me the keys.

You shouldn't call them keys.

It's a paperclip that you start the car with.

(engine squealing and moaning)

SCHMIDT: See, that was the noise

I was talking you about.

WINSTON:

Shut up.

You know you don't have to sit like that.

It's the only way that it feels okay, Jess.

Jess!

JESS: Sadie.

Hey. Hey. How are you?

SADIE: Good. How are you? Hey, good to see you again, Nick.

(straining):

Hey. Hi.

We were playing football, and I tackled him.

Oh. Well, that's not exactly how I saw it.

Oh, I'm surprised you got hurt. You're such a big boy.

Jess tackled a girl I was dating once.

Oh, yeah.

She tried to steal my overalls.

Okay, so... does that hurt?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes!

All right.

Does that hurt?

(groaning loudly)

All right. He can flip over.

Okay.

(sighs)

So... listen.

This is not an official examination, and I am not officially telling you that you bruised your spine, and I am not officially giving you these pills to manage the pain.

Okay.

So...

please don't take those pills.

Take the pills.

Don't take those pills.

JESS: Take the pills.

SADIE: Nobody prescribed them.

Take them. Take them.

Why would you take them?

No. That's bad.

That's a code. Take them.

JESS:

That means do it.

Don't do that. No...

Those are designed for severe menstrual cramps, so they should cure your baby back ache.

JESS (chuckling):

"Baby backache."

Wait. Stop.

Hey, take another sip of water.

Yeah, um... JESS: What? What's wrong?

No, it's your thyroid. I noticed something while you were swallowing. Do you mind if I...?

I mean, I don't know what choice I have.

JESS: Do it, Nick!

Okay, Jess. Stop.

Yeah, he has a growth.

Oh, my God.

A growth.

Oh, no.

Everything works. I can swallow.

Oh, my God.

Everything's fine. I know what you're talking about.

You knew about this?

Yes.

So you've had it checked out?

No, no, I don't...

I don't have that stuff checked out. I'm fine.

I can set up an ultrasound tomorrow morning, first thing ... I've got a friend.

I can't really afford an ultrasound, but...

You're going to have to, so...

Yeah.

SADIE: All right. So I'll set that up?

Absolutely.

Right. Right.

Make sure he goes, Jess.

Don't look at me like that, Jess.

It's probably nothing.

Yeah, it's nothing.

Oh, God.

Put the baby's head at the bottom.

I'm not going to go tomorrow.

I'd rather not, because I don't want to get an ultrasound.

I just don't have time.

No, I've got some writing I got to do.

The truth is, with working out, I've got some people to see, so I just can't make it.

I lost a stamp.

It sounds worse than it is, but it's a somewhat expensive stamp and I had planned on looking for it.

One of the reasons I moved to Los Angeles was to get closer to whales, so I can record them.

I haven't gotten around to it because where we live is actually east.

It's way farther from the ocean than I expected.

I appreciate your concern.

It is really sweet. It's nice.

But this machine's still kicking, you know?

You're going.

And I know your scared, but you know what my mom used to do when I got scared?

A Daffy Duck impression.

Please don't do what you're about to do.

(imitating Daffy's lisp):

Hey, Nicholas.

I'm sorry you have a lump in your throat.

That's despicable!

Sorry. Too much?

Okay.

I got to go to work.

I'll come with you.

Oh, absolutely not.

I'll just sit by the bar.

No way.

(lively conversation, laughter)

You told them, Jess? Really, it's not a big deal.

Don't tell them.

We're just hanging out.

With my best friend.

Come on, Schmidt. What are you do...?

(sputters)

You just Fredo-kiss me? What's your problem?

Go sit down.

You're going to b*at this, man.

I don't have anything.

What is going on with you guys?

Thanks for telling them.

I take those, too ...

when I got a heavy flow.

Good to know.

Hey.

Hey.

So I heard.

Of course you did.

Can I get a vodka soda?

(chuckles)

Thank you. You being normal...

Vodka soda.

Okay.

It's because he refuses to wear a Bluetooth. You know that.

I gave him one for his birthday, too, but he just laughed in my face.

Gave it back to me for Hanukkah.

Well, according to this Web site, it could be a colloid nodule.

But that's most common in golden retrievers.

I thought my lifestyle choices would rub off on him.

I tried to set a good example.

Treat your body like a temple.

Treat your body like a temple.

But he treats his like a dump.

Like a dump!

Let me see this.

Oh, my God.

NICK: Hey, hey.

My friends.

Can I just say that these pills are amazing?

I feel, like, really warm in my uterus.

Oh! I feel good.

Feel real good.

What's with the long faces?

Schmidt?

Just looking at you and your beautiful soul.

Big, strong Nick.

He's a champ. SCHMIDT: I wish I could trade places with you, 'cause you know what, Nick?

I would do it in a second.

But I'm also glad that I can't.

Okay, what is going on with you three?

(crying): Oh, God. Jess?

Oh, God.

Hey, are you okay?

You're gonna freak him out. You're gonna freak him out.

You're freaking everybody out.

Why are you crying?

Schmidt, are you crying?

'Cause you're not helping.

'Cause you're making me cry with your emotion.

(Winston sobbing)

Really, Winston? You?

It's just that I love you so much, man.

Stop it. Enough.

Hey, I'm fine. Just stop it.

How do you know you're fine, Nick?

Is that... would that be where... in my neck?

Hmm.

(taps piano key)

I'm not going to lie.

Mm-hmm.

I think the pills are on top of me a little bit.

I think you're right.

It's so sad.

Yeah, it's really sad your friend's getting an ultrasound tomorrow.

It's just so hard.

Are you using your best friend's medical crisis to feel my boobs with your face?

Why isn't the whole world making love all at the same time?

How many...

ears does Daniel Boone have?

He's got a... a right ear, a left ear and a... front ear.

"Frontier."

Get it?

(both chuckling)

You don't get to speak at my funeral.

What?

For sure.

100%.

What? Why?

Because of that joke.

Yeah, but...

Jess, you don't want to talk at a funeral.

I've tried that once.

What kind of dummy fixes a washing machine using a Kn*fe?

This kind of dummy!

It did not go well.

I don't want you talking at my funeral!

Okay.

You can go to my funeral, but you can't talk.

My funeral is my time to shine.

I want the girls to think,

"I wish I brought Nick Miller to orgasm."

And I want the guys to think,

"I wish I bought him more stuff."

And I don't want Daffy Duck voices and feeling sticks.

You don't... you don't know how to be real.

I can't have you trying to cheer people up.

I know how to be real.

Question: Am I wearing a hat?

SCHMIDT:

Nick Miller.

Almost a lawyer.

(playing piano)

âª This is a sad song... âª

Oh.

Mm.

âª This is the saddest song in the world âª

Yes, it is.

Mm.

âª This is the saddest... âª

You just keep singing, man.

Okay.


âª This is a sad song âª
âª Hey, hey âª
âª Mm-hmm âª
âª Saddest song in the world âª

Got a nice voice, man.

It is so weird being sober right now.

Can I get some weird rapping?

âª Never does anything. âª

(pounds keys)

What?

You want me to get real and stop being all cutesy and whatever, fine.

Let's get real.

You don't do anything.

Mm.

What did you want to do?

I mean, isn't there something you wanted to accomplish?

Hey, I've done things.

I wrote half a book about zombies.

Okay, just tell me.

If you could do anything, what would you do?

You know, I'm the guy who... I can't just jump into something if I don't know what's gonna happen.

I never have been that guy.

Like, I'm the, I'm the guy that, if I don't know what's gonna happen, I don't do something.

Ever. I don't care how bad I want to do it.

I don't do it.

Like, if everybody would go into the ocean and jumped in the water, well, I'm the guy on the beach guarding the wallets.

All right.

All right, Nick.

All right.

Get out there.

Yeah.

I'll hold your wallet.

I don't have a wallet.

All right, well, that's fine.

I have a sandwich bag with my license and money in it.

Okay, I'll hold your sandwich bag.

Get out there, go.

It's a little cold.

Just in terms of running into the water, it's a tad on the cold side.

Well, you know what, just... it's just...

(laughs)

(laughs)

(yelling)

We all taking our shoes off?

What's going on?

I'm a little drunk, and I can't be too sure, but I think you're finally about to see your best friend's penis.

(Nick yelling)

Nick ... he's gonna sh ...

he's gonna show his penis to the ocean and not me?

Nick, wait!

(laughs)

I'm alive!

I... am... alive!

(chuckling)

I'm alive!

(yelling)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

This is stupid!

No, it's cold!

My testicles are in my abdomen!

What was I thinking?

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! That is so cold!

That is so cold!

Words cannot describe how cold that is!

Nick, are you okay?

No, I'm not okay, Jess!

I'm not okay!

All right, I woke up today and I wanted to play a friendly game of touch football, then I hurt my back, and I went to your gynecologist, and now I might have cancer!

So, no, Jess!

I'm not okay!

(sighs)

SCHMIDT: I don't think this is the right time to bring this up, you guys, but...

does anyone else think Nick could stand to lose five to seven pounds?

(sighs)

You know what I'm thinking about, Ceec?

What, Schmidt?

That when you stand up, there's gonna be, like, a perfect imprint of your butt in the sand.

That is what you're thinking about right now with your best friend down the beach going through what he's going through?

I know, I know.

Then why would you say that?

I don't know why I would say that.

Why would anyone say that?

I've never gone through anything like this.

Yeah, well, I have.

What happened?

My dad d*ed when I was 12.

That's, um...

The only way to get through it is to get through it.

You know, I had a cat that d*ed...

Don't compare my dad to your cat.

It was a big cat.

I mean, human size.

(chuckles)

Hey.

Oh, hey.

Is this seat taken?

(chuckles):

Oh, please.

Here, will you help me up?

(grunts)

I know that you're right.

You're right, I have to start doing things.

I can't just...you know.

Jess...

I like you a lot.

I really do.

I'm glad you're around.

I'm not gonna remember any of this in the morning, am I?

Most certainly not.

Oh, no.

(laughs)

Yeah, it's... yeah.

(laughs)

Yeah, we should go home.

Yes.

Let's go home.

Hey. We gotta wake up.

Morning.

What?

Hey, Schmidty!

(whistles)

Wake up, wake up! Everybody, up!

I got that ultrasound thing.

We're late.

What?

Oh...

Hey, Winston.

We're late, man.

SCHMIDT:

Ah, fresh air.

Back to the fume chamber.

NICK: Couldn't even sell it for metal.

Hope you didn't get sand in my car.

SCHMIDT: Yeah, that's this car's problem: too much sand.

Oh, my God, there's soot coming in from the floor.

(clears throat)

Hi. Uh, my name is Nick Miller.

I-I have a 9:00 a.m. today.

Fill these out. I'm gonna need a copy of your health insurance.

Oh.

I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be paying with cash, actually.

It's a mixture of, uh, paper money and change.

I do have a check that's postdated.

There's a 60/40 sh*t that's gonna clear.

I hope that's good.

Jess ... oh, yeah.

Do I have to do this now?

How long does it take to tell if someone has cancer?

Guys.

Hey.

I'm okay. I'm fine.

I'm fine. It's nothing.

Yeah.

What was it? What did they say it was?

I didn't hear anything after they said,

"You don't have cancer."

I blanked out. I think it's, like, a cyst or something.

Ugh.

Stop Fredo-kissing me, Schmidt.

All right, so what do I owe you?

Let's figure this out.

I've got, uh...

It's already taken care of.

What do you mean it's already taken care of?

Oh, we split it.

All right, well, I'll pay you guys back.

I just...

And can you please get a wallet?

I do have a wallet.

A wallet.

I have tons of wallet chains that you can borrow.

âª Deep inside the ever-spinning... âª

Hey, Jess?

Hmm?

What happened last night?

Nothing.

(ignition sputtering)

(chuckles softly)

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

(sputtering stops)

NICK: Let it go, bud.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Just got to give it a second.

Bye.

SCHMIDT: It's cruel at this point.

The car's d*ad, bud.

(ignition continues sputtering)

âª I'll take care of you âª
âª If you ask me to âª
âª In a year or two... âª
âª Oh... âª

Don't walk so damn fast.

I'm coming.

Can't a man say good-bye to his car?

Oh! Oh!

L'Chaim.

To humping.

I was like a river.

Did you feel that? Did you feel me sweeping you along with the current of my body?

You were like a canoe on my body river.

Like you'd ever be seaworthy with those breasts.

Boobies.

I wish there was a word that meant complete satisfaction and complete self-loathing.

I've never seen a woman bite her own shoulder before.

That was the last time.

You said that twice last night.

You'll be back.

I'm like your black tar heroin.

You just need that sweet taste in your veins.

Schmidttle and the damage done.

Neil Young, yo.

Just get me out of here without someone seeing.

Schmidt?

Oh, did you have a sexual guest?

What?

Was it the same girl from the other night?

I don't know what you're talking about.

It is!

Oh, my God. You slept with the same girl twice in a row?

Was it a mistake? Was she wearing some kind of disguise?

Hey, Nick, Schmidt slept with the same girl twice in a row.

I owe you five dollars.

You know, I thought I heard the door open at 3:00 a.m.

Those are the sounds of true love.

Bet she had the time of her life.

What happened?

Did I miss her?

You did.

Man, I love meeting the girls you bring home.

I like to pretend like I'm your lover on the down-low, Theodore K. Mullins.

Damn, Schmidt, in our bed?

Where we shave each other?

I've always loved you, you're my boo.

Theodore K. Mullins is not my type, man.

So, you gonna three-peat this ho?

Who is this bitch? We want to meet her.

I'm not gonna parade her around like some trophy.

You know me, I'm not that kind of guy.

Oh!

Schmidt told me this was the front door?

What's wrong with her? Does she have a hunchback?

Dwarf parts?

Lovitz body?

She happens to be an incredibly beautiful woman.

She another one of your heavy gingers, Schmidt?

How big are her knuckles?

Butter body?

She has a h*tler moustache.

I'm sorry, just, like, I want to banter with you guys in the morning.

I just, like, panicked, and I made a h*tler joke.

I'm sorry.

* Hey, girl

* What you doing?

* Hey, girl

* Where you going?

* Who's that girl?

* Who's that girl? *

* Who's that girl?

* Who's that girl? *

* It's Jess.

Your science projects are looking great, you guys.

Love the potato battery, Harper.

Good job.

Thanks.

Luke, I like your tree exhibit.

Might want to think about changing the name.

Okay?

Okay.

Whoa.

You built a robotic arm.

I think we know who's gonna win.

Anyone can still win, Brianna.

Even me, Miss Day?

Yes.

Okay, lunchtime.

Can I have lunch in here?

Oh, no, Nathaniel, what's wrong?

In the cafeteria, kids have started playing this game, coin slot.

They put pennies in my butt cr*ck.

I made 46 cents.

No, no, no, you earned that.

Um, Nathaniel, I'm gonna help you out.

Julia sent me a cactus.

She's on a business trip to China, and she sent it to me out of the blue.

I'm not an idiot.

She's gonna break up with me.

Who told you that?

Did the cactus tell you that?

Is this one of those fortune-telling cactuses...

Winston, think. She's gonna break up with me.

She doesn't think I can take care of a regular plant.

Well, you can't.

Any idiot can take care of a cactus, Winston.

She thinks I'm an idiot.

Why are you watering a cactus?

Because I'm an idiot.

Julia sent him a cactus, which means she's gonna break up with him.

Hm.

I'm sorry, I thought that was a joke because otherwise that would be totally stupid and insane.

Snap out of it, son.

Jess, you don't get it.

This cactus is like a symbol of my relationship with her.

Oh!

Oh, my God.

I'm not gonna quit on this.

I'm gonna get her back.

There it is.

Look at that.

Not bad, just fix red eye, red eye, red eye.

Send.

Hello?

Where are you?

Oh, hey, Cecilia, Did you get my junk mail?

I'm in front of your loft.

I know I said that last time was the last time, but... you want to come down?

Yeah, I want to co...

Yeah, I'll come down, that sounds good.

All right.

So, I think I changed a life today, you guys.

I pulled a Gandhi, a real Gandhi.

There's a student of mine, he's been bullied for the past few months, so after warning the kids that there would be serious repercussions if this continued, I delivered a lesson in the key of learning.

Learning minor.

* He's a plump bird who prefers the shelter of a hole *

* He has a stubby beak

* And a nervous soul

* Because being chased

* By predators takes its toll

* Let the sad sparrow fly on... *

You think singing a song about a kid is gonna stop him from getting his ass kicked?

I know 12-year-olds are vicious, vengeful creatures.

Middle-school girls literally scalp each other.

I spent most of sixth grade with a bald spot on my head.

What?

But don't tell me music can't make a difference,

'cause it can.

Those kids were videotaping me on their cell phones.

Right.

I think these kids are gonna really remember that.

Yeah, um, You know, this day.

What's the song called?

Um, "Sad Sparrow"

"

" why?

This is why.

* He's not smartest bird or the most pretty *

* He spreads disease What?

* Throughout the city Well, at least the bully's not making fun of that kid any more.

They're making fun of me.

The hawk just took a little poop on you.

I'm not proud of myself for saying this, but it's a really funny video.

* Sad sparrow fly on...

Why can't we just go upstairs for a little Schmidt and Spin?

You just said that everybody's upstairs in the living room.

Okay, fine, what about your place?

My place is not an option right now.

All the models are there.

It's 12 models in two rooms.

It's like a room full of hungry Russians.

Uh, yes, please, let's go there.

What about just a little good, old-fashioned car sex?

I can't do any of my moves in there.

I like to improvise with my body.

I'm like a sexual snowflake.

Each night with me is a unique experience, Cece.

Okay, are we gonna do this, or not?

'Cause I kind of need this to happen right now, okay?

Isn't there, like, a Starbucks bathroom around here or something we could use?

What do I look like, a Gypsy courtesan?

So, how hard are you gonna drop the hammer on the kid who did this?

I'm gonna find this kid, and I'm just gonna...

open up a dialogue.

Not gonna work.

Take it from me, I used to be a bully.

Ow!

Brown lightning!

Wow, you had a catchphrase? Yeah.

You got to h*t them where it hurts.

Thank you, Winston, but I have a different approach.

Jerk-sica?

My last name rhymes with "gay,"

and the best thing you can think of is Jerk-sica?

Reason.

Hey, Schmidt.

Oh, there is? Thank you.

He says we should look out the window.

There's a crescent moon out tonight.

Oh, dip, seriously?

Why do we care about a crescent moon?

I don't know.

I'm gonna live up there someday.

Hey, Julia, what's up, girl?

Hope you're having a great time in Beijing.

I miss you;

I can't wait to see you.

I got the cactus.

Thank you so much.

I'm taking great care of it.

Yeah, things are doing good here.

Everything's really cool, just...

taking names, kicking butt, you know, all that.

So, great, I'll see you Wednesday.

You're the best around.

Nope, that's not gonna be the one.

Hey, Julia, just calling back to say that I get it.

Message received.

I'm the cactus.

If you put me in the desert, I'll grow some needles, too.

You bet I would.

You bet I would.

FYI, I'm not high right now.

Julia!

Julia!

Call me back.

Call me back, Julia.

Julia, it's Nick.

I'm sorry, I just realized about the time difference.

So, if you get this one first, could you please just delete the other ones?

I love you.

What did I jus...?

I don't hear anyone out there.

I think I'm safe.

And I-I want you to know, that was the last time, okay?

This is over.

But we haven't even gotten to the cheese course.

A little sharp aged cheddar? Mm-hmm.

Manchego?

Maybe some buttery GruyÃ¨re?

You sure you want to miss out?

I just want to...

slowly peel the wax off your Babybels.

What are you even saying?

How about a little stinky Taleggio?

Why is this working?

I am so turned on right now.

Or maybe some cream cheese?

Want some schmear, Cece?

You know what?

Cece, you should go.

Because if you have the strength to turn all this down, do it.

Yeah, I'm good.

Hi. Who do I speak to re: getting something removed from the Internet?

Yeah, I can hold.

Want to party with Havarti?

Fine.

Give me the damn cheese.

So, Brianna, I saw the robot arm in the user profile, so I know you made that video.

So I thought we could sit and talk for a minute.

Look, Brianna, I know you're better than this.

Can we talk about you for a few minutes?

Can we talk about you instead?

I'm an open book;

Ask me anything.

How come you don't have a boyfriend?

And why did Mr. Genzlinger dump you?

And is it true that your boyfriend before that cheated on you?

Are you barren, Miss Day?

And why is your voice so deep like a man's?

It's no... it's not.

Your happiness seems like a mask.

Well, I better go.

What have I done?

Julia! Welcome home!

Hey.

Are you okay?

Yes, I'm okay;

Welcome back.

Are you sure?

Did you listen to all the messages?

I did.

You did? That sucks.

You know, I really didn't mean anything.

I know.

I-I didn't.

Look, I got in my head, Julia, I thought you sent me this cactus because you were trying to tell me that I can't take care of a normal plant.

Which, when I think about it, I probably can't.

Plants freak me out.

I'm way better with babies, actually.

Hmm.

Not that I want to have, like, a baby with you, like, right now.

I can see us having babies.

Please, can we not...

I know, that's not what I mean to say.

No, come on...

I'm getting weird again. What I mean to say, - No, Nick, I need to say...

Julia, please, I overreacted.

I think we should break up.

I do. I mean, I didn't realize it when I sent it...

but then after listening to the seven...

Yeah, I know.

...Seven, Nick, Seven, yeah.

Separate voice mails about the meaning behind the cactus, I don't know, it really just clicked in for me, and I just, I don't think that we should do this any more.

I'm really sorry.

So I was right about the cactus.

Okay, what kind of crazy person destroys a child's robot?

Can you bring me, like, a bunch of Phillips head screwdrivers and, like, a Crescent wrench and, like, other tool things?

What if I'm busy?

Thank you, Winston.

I really needed that.

It's been a really hard week.


Hey, man, I'm going to the beach to watch the sun go down, 'cause I love sunsets.

Did you know that about me?

What the hell is wrong with you?

Oh, Julia dumped me, so sad face.

Hey, do you want to come with me to the beach?

'Cause I feel great, I'm ready to rock, but I really don't want to be alone.

Scissors?

How am I supposed to fix a robot arm with scissors?

Those are my good scissors.

Why do you have good scissors?

You know, the news only focuses on what goes wrong.

Never talks about what goes right.

Evolution.

That's it. Come here.

You know?

Yeah, exactly.

I'm gonna k*ll him. Can you get him out of here?

Hey, guys, you guys want to watch The Piano later?

Here?

You want to do it here?

Okay... all right. What's the scenario?

We enter separately, pretending to be strangers meeting in the bathroom.

You want me on the can, off the can?

No, I just, I just need to pop in this party for, like, 20 minutes.

When I come back, we'll have sex.

Okay, yeah, let's do it.

Oh, no. Um, I'm going in there alone.

Well, what am I supposed to do?

I'll cr*ck a window for you.

cr*ck a window for me?

Yeah.

What am I, your sex dog?

What... what if I have to go to the bathroom?

Why don't you just give me a chew toy.

Come on, Schmidt, stop being such a big baby.

Oh, my... Are you ashamed of me?

Yes. Absolutely.

100%. I'm 100%

ashamed of you.

What-what a revelation.

Okay, come on, Schmidt, I can't be the first woman who's ashamed to be with you.

Okay, look, I won't go into your party, if...

if you go to breakfast with me tomorrow.

In public.

Yeah, okay.

Oh, really?

Really.

I mean, I can survive breakfast.

I'll be back soon.

Hey, Wendy. How's it going?

I hope it works.

I didn't get a chance to test it.

Even broken, it's still got a sh*t at top prize.

I mean, have you seen some of this crap?

"What can old people do?"

"Does it taste better with hot sauce?"

My friends.

Guess what I just learned.

What's inside of a pumpkin.

Apparently, a lot.

I didn't know.

Whoa!

Winston, you have to get him out of here.

You see him, he's about to blow.

I'm not having him by himself right now.

There's Brianna.

Hi, Brianna.

You must be Brianna's moms.

I'm Miss Day.

Right. The singer.

You're the one who sings.

This is Brianna's project, a robotic arm.

Start it up, Brianna.

And a project bursts into flames.

Brianna, what happened?

Someone must have sabotaged it.

Bet it was Nathaniel.

Hey! Get my scissors out of your mouth!

What is wrong with you?!

He's been creating problems for our daughter.

What are you gonna do about it?

Nathaniel, come over here.

Um, actually, uh...this is my fault.

I sabotaged the science project.

You did what?

What?

And it was totally unprofessional.

And I'm sorry, but your daughter is... how do I put this?

Brianna is difficult.

Difficult? You're the one that sabotaged her project.

You daughter sucks.

Okay, she is a demon seed, she is the spawn of Satan.

And I do believe I speak for the entire human race when I say that people like her should not be building robots.

Who are you?

Brown lightning.

I want her disciplined.

No! No!

Wonderful.

Hey, no.

No.

Why can't we all just love each other, right?

What are you doing?

Want a science project?

How about this as a science project: love is a myth.

Why is this Earth so big and I am so small?

So, yay, Earth.

Be optimistic? Learn?

We're all gonna die alone, so...

My office, 9:00 a.m.

How embarrassing.

I was right about the cactus.

I assure you, I'll be watching Miss Day very closely.

Hey.

Hi.

I am so sorry, Tanya.

Don't be.

I love it!

Jess, you're a real teacher now.

What?

You're a kid hater.

You're one of us.

Come here. Welcome.

I'm-I'm not a kid hater.

That's right.

None of us are.

Hey, Brianna.

Can I speak to you?

Look, I know I'm not your favorite teacher.

You don't like my style.

That's fine.

But I'm not gonna change who I am, so you're just gonna have to deal with it and respect it.

Also, you're gonna take this paper, and you're gonna sing a duet with me.

What?!

Oh, yeah.

Everybody, settle down.

Camera phones are encouraged.

No.

One, two, three, four.

You really don't want to be seen having breakfast with me, do you?

Are we even still in L.A.?

Schmidt, you and I are not together.

We're not in a relationship.

We're just having sex.

And I love it.

And I'm not gonna be a prize that you get to show off.

Look, guys are always just showing me off, and I hate it.

Look, I... I want to tell people because I think that you are the dopest, flyest...smartest, ballsiest, bitchiest, truly terrifying woman that I have sexually enjoyed in a really long time.

Do you want to tell the waitress?

Uh, if I could have everyone's attention.

Real quick, if you could, uh...

Hey, guys, call a time-out to whatever-whatever-

whatever that thing is. Okay, great.

I am having sex with this woman right here.

You want to stand up?

No. Okay, you don't want to do it? All right, great.

I'm enjoying myself im-immensely.

Uh, it's, you know, a physical thing, but I am definitely, for real having sex with this girl right here, to completion.

Parkour!

h*t it!

Down! h*t it!

Down! h*t it!

Yeah.

Hey.

I got you a real plant.

Yeah, I don't want it, Jess;

I'll just k*ll it.

I know.

You're a plant k*ller.

And I write songs.

We're weirdos.

But that's who we are.

And that's fine.

And you have a giant cactus needle sticking out of your face.

What? Where is it?

Can you get it out? Get it out. Ow.

* So it's time we all make a change *

* Find somewhere else for our loose change *

The song is called "Let Me Lift You Up With My Robot Arm"?

Yeah.

It's catchy.

I mean, the title is flawed, there's no question about that.

But you are kicking ass with the comments.

Look at this.

"This teacher is muy caliente."

Hot, hot, hot.

"I'd like to grade her on a curve."

Yep.

"Finally, entertainment that doesn't resort to salty language."

Finally.

Jess, these commenters are all you, aren't they?

Yes. Yes, they are.

* A robot arm.

That's classic Nick Miller. Hey look, I'm holding your hand, and what?

Yeah, I want to go out tonight.

Ugh, couples!

Boo. Hiss.

Every time you have sex with the same person, Jess, you die just a little bit.

It's like a copy of a copy.

But lucky us ... we get to go out looking for some strange.

Happy V-Day, player!

Holla!

Look, Jess, truth is, I don't go out on Valentine's Day.

What?

There's no thrill.

You know, all these bars filled with emotionally vulnerable women.

I'm like a Dominican teenager playing Little League.

It's just not fair for everybody else.

It's my first single Valentine's Day in six years, and I... I need to go out, okay?

We need to go out.

'Cause I'm feeling pretty twirly.

Twirly?

Twirly.

Is that like horny?

I got the dirty twirls, Schmidtty.

Watch out, 'cause you're about to get laid... world!

* Who's that girl? * * Who's that girl? *

* Who's that girl? *

* Who's that girl? * * It's Jess. *

So, we're doing this ... 

full-on Valentine's.

What'd you do last year?

I was fighting with Caroline.

What were you fighting about?

Oh, you know, the usual ...

about how I make too much money and I dress too fancy and I'm too good at communicating my feelings.

Right.

Well, this year we're gonna make up for it.

You and me are gonna do a real Valentine's Day date.

I know. God, what's the plan?

Well, first of all, you're gonna need a map of Arizona.

I can get that.

And a container that you're comfortable getting urine in.

Oh, I have one in my purse.

You do?

No. Bad idea.

You can't go on a first date on Valentine's Day, Winston.

Dude, I'm telling you, it's not a first date, man.

We used to hook up all the time.

You know, for two years I had her number stored in my phone as "Shretty,"

'cause I was too drunk to type "Shelby."

She just wanted a relaxed night in.

It actually sounds kind of sexy.

Dude, we're just trying to figure each other out, that's all.

You know where that puts you in six months?

Yeah, watching

It's Complicated on DVD while you cradle your newborn baby to sleep.

And guess what? It's not complicated.

It's about a bunch of rich white people who are remodeling their kitchen.

Are you sure you're really ready for that?

Dude, it's gonna be great.

What are you doing?

I'm packing an overnight bag in case I have one-night sex.

I've got a T-shirt, socks...

Is this a sewing kit?

Yes, it's a sewing kit.

Stain remover.

* Hello? *

You don't have one-night stands ... you get way too attached.

I mean, you could have an emotional connection with a shoe on the side of the road.

Oh, one shoe? I hate that.

Is this Schmidt's idea.

It's my idea.

I want to try a one-night stand. Tonight...

is all about what

Little Jess wants.

Little Jess.

Okay, all right. I am gonna text Kyle and tell him to meet us at the bar, because I'm not leaving you alone like this...

with all of that.

I'm sorry, I don't know who's smelling what tonight.

Excuse me, you know where

Julia Cleary's office is?

Uh, does she need to sign for something?

Little late for a package, isn't it?

Let me guess, your bike broke down.

Fixed-gear, single-speed.

I've been rocking a three-speed.

No, I'm not a bike messenger.

Follow me.

Okay.

She can get pretty cranky when she gets interrupted, but I'll tell you what, I would still h*t that.

I mean, despite the age difference, I would just take that to Pound Town.

You know what I mean?

Just take her a visit to the boneyard.

You know what I'm saying.

Hey, Nick.

That's my boyfriend, Nick.

Hi. That's my little intern, Cliff.

Excuse me, Cliff.

What...?

Could you get him a water?

Thank you.

Hey, Cliff.

Thanks, Cliff.

Sorry it's such a mess in here.

But... I went full out with the cheesy Valentine's Day stuff.

Are you ready for it?

What did you do?

Ha-ha!

Heart boxers! These are the best!

Right? - I'm putting them on right now over my pants.

You can't stop me.

I don't want to stop you, because I...

am gonna be rockin'

this action.

You were born to wear that thing.

We can never talk about any of this, to anybody. - Okay.

Can we go?

I have a little bit more work to do ... just, like, an hour.

Hey, babe.

Ooh, you brought wine.

Yeah.

Good. We're almost out.

It's not the food!

Come on in. Pick out a polish.

He looks like a player.

Ah. Never mind.

I thought we said no guys.

I am not touching his feet.

I'm not kidding you.

That's amazing.

Where's what's his name?

We are actually gonna meet up later, because...

he's got a little surprise for me.

Spoiler: it's his penis.

Okay, stop. Enough.

Pay attention.

You're from Oregon?

Yeah.

I'm from Oregon.

Oh, no. What?

I mean, how often do you meet Oregonians?

I don't know.

Oh, could you hold on one second?

Yeah. Sure.

Okay.

Oh, my God, he's from Oregon; I'm from Oregon.

Bad idea.

No, you can't do this.

Horrible.

I'm sorry.

You bonded emotionally.

If you end up having sex with him, it's gonna be missionary with a lot of eye contact.

Look, that is not one-night-stand material.

You got to listen to him.

He's right on this one. Sorry.

I know what I'm talking about.

I have my 10,000 hours.

Outliers.

You should read it.

Malcolm Gladwell.

It's one of my desert island books.

Along with Machiavelli's

The Prince,

Freak by John Leguizamo, any of the scripts from the first season of Vampire Diaries,

a little Phantom T.

I love Phantom Tollbooth.

Of course you do ... you're a human being.

So no connection?

Zero.

Sorry, babe. No.

Good girl.

* *

Hey.

Could I have your cherry?

Sure.

Cool.

Sorry.

You okay, lady?

Hmm.

Schwing!

Hey, guys. Um...

this is Oliver.

Um, Oliver is a...

Web creator.

Web creator.

Uh, also, we both love... lunch.

Lunch.

Love lunch.

You're kidding.

Wow, what a coincidence.

When people talk about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, I'm, like...

What...

what?!

Is that?!

What about lunch, man?

You want another drink?

If I didn't know ya better, I'd think you're tryin'

to liquor me up!

Why are you talking like that?

Oh, Oliver...

we have nothing in common.

Yes! I have no emotional connection to him at all.

But I'm just gonna eat lunch off that butt.

So, what about you?

What about that redhead over there?

I thought you totally had that.

Oh, that's in process.

This is where I do this kind of, like, look thing, where, like, my confusion makes her confused...

and, then, also kind of hot.

Let me help you.

I'm gonna make her jealous.

All right, can you... can you stop?

Cece, you are way too beautiful.

She'll think she doesn't have a sh*t with me.

Can you stop looking at me like that, please?

What look? I'm not even looking at you.

The pouty one, the naughty baby Indian.

I just ate something spicy, and now my lip is swollen. Mm-hmm.

Baby! Hi!

Hey!

All right, just get in there, man.

Clean it all out.

Like a dentist.

Hey!

Hey-hey-hey-hey!

Wow!

Look, look.

Surprise!

'Shrooms.

Oh, Kyle, you really shouldn't have.

I ate three.

I ate three. Three.

On a pizza!

Look at you, man.

You're a champion.

Okay, um, we're gonna go, 'cause he's about to get real handsy and a little r*cist.

So, you'll watch Jess?

Yeah, yeah, I will.

Okay. Let's go, Kyle.

Schmidtty, Schmidtty, Schmidtty.

Hey, um, so, I'm gonna go home with Oliver.

Great! I'm so happy...

Hey, three words:

Double bag it.

I got that covered. Um...

These guys...

hundy bag, so...

A hundred condoms?

What, are you gonna have sex with an army?

* Oh, I'm gonna *

* Get up in it, mon. *

That's the biggest box of condoms I've ever seen, honestly.

Does it have, like, a roller?

Like, you know, you go through the airport with it?

I'm gonna rip him a new one.

Very intimidating.

A normal man can go maybe three times in a night, depending on how much salmon he's had.

He's literally the most boring person I've ever met.

He's described every lunch he's had this week, and three of them were tacos.

My work here is done.

Not really.

Little favor. He doesn't have a car, I don't have a car,

'cause I came with you, so I...

No, no, no, no.

No. No.

One of the tacos had extra cheese, and the other one had avocados.

And cheese.

And cheese, actually.

Well, I guess it's time to take that Chinese head out of that Chinese ass, Ming.

That's so sweet.

I love that. Thank you.

Hey, I pushed the reservation to 8:30.

Okay, I just need

40 to 50 more minutes, okay?

I'm sorry.

No, no, no.


Hey, Confucius say: "You work for me."

What, Winston?

Hey, man, look, I'm sorry to call you ... I know you're at dinner.

No, I'm not, Winston. I'm actually hanging out with a guy named Cliff.

Are we hanging out?

That's awesome.

Listen here, man, I'm at Shelby's house.

And there's two other girls here.

They're drinking cranberry juice, talking about Michelle Obama's upper-body workout.

I got a nose strip on my face, man.

So leave.

It's just that...

I really enjoy being around this girl.

All right, so stay.

You know what, I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna...

Can I ask you something?

With her, the...

is it... is it gentle, or is it... not so gentle?

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I'm gonna act like you didn't just say that, Cliff. - Fair enough.

Yeah, Ming, I got your text.

What-what part of that did you not understand?

Do you want some champagne, Cliff?

What is that?

Is he injured?

No, I think...

Pause. Pause.

Why are you pausing?

Bathroom break.

It's right in the middle of the movie.

What are... What's wrong with him?

Why are you still here?

You don't have a car, he doesn't have a car;

How you gonna get home?

I'm gonna take a cab, Schmidt.

It's a horrible neighborhood, okay?

There are youths everywhere.

Youths? Are you Officer Krupke?

Would you st...

Damn it.

It's Cece. Hello?

Why are you crashing Jess's one-night stand?

Well, he asked me if I wanted to watch Planet of the Apes.

I didn't know he meant right now.

Ugh.

What's wrong with you?

Hate you. Tell him to leave.

Get out of there, Schmidt.

Leave your car there, and I'll come get you, okay?

What is going on over there?

Where are you; where's Kyle?

I'm at a playground.

Kyle's shrooming.

Woo-woo.

I'll see you guys later.

I love brown people!

That's r*cist, Kyle.

Excuse me.

Back to the movie.

Ready?

Yeah.

Yeah.

These monkeys look so real.

Apes.

They're apes.

Oh... you're one of those.

Get out.

Like there's a real difference?

Get out now!

All right.

Youths!

You know what, Cliff?

I'm sorry, I'm just feeling very romantic, and I have nowhere else to put it, so happy Valentine's Day, good looking.

You know what?

What?

Put it right here.

'Cause I-I like it.

So how did you get that far into law school and then drop out?

Well, I got my heart broken.

Yeah.

And then everything got weird.

I started playing guitar in an alt-country-ska band. - Sure.

Gambling a lot.

Yeah.

There was a really weird week where I wore a long blonde wig and I made everybody call me Sandy Ferguson.

I have never loved anyone that much.

Then I drove to Mexico, and I tried to enter a cockfight.

As a person?

Yes, Cliff, as a person.

Come on!

Get me out of here!

Help! Help!

I've had a tough couple of days, Freddie.

The point of the story is I looked around at my life and I realized that I didn't want to work for somebody else my whole life.

That is exactly how I feel, man.

Yeah, but the second half of that story is how I went broke and started working for somebody else my whole life.

Okay, what was that?

I don't want to be a lawyer.

I don't want to do this.

Don't do this. Not tonight.

I'm leaving. I'm leaving tonight.

Oh, Cliff.

Look what I found under a pile of depositions.

I'm quitting!

What?

Nick convinced me that I can't waste my life doing your stapling any more.

I never said anything like that, Julia.

Not doing it any more. I'm not working all night on Valentine's Day.

I'm just gonna get in my car, and I'm just gonna drive until I see the sun.

'Cause it's got to be shining somewhere.

And for once in my life, I'm gonna spend some time with my birds.

With you birds?

Woo! No, Cliff!

We're gonna start paying you so soon!

Julia, I am so sorry.

I just told him a story about when I got arrested in Mexico.

You got arrested in Mexico?

I wasn't gonna tell you until after you got knocked up and were stuck with me.

Now I got to do all this stuff.

I know.

I'm sorry.

Just go home, Nick.

Sorry.

I'll call you tomorrow.

No!

What?

Are you kidding me?

Hey, baby.

Uh, this is my ex, Amy.

We broke up last week.

She can't afford to move out

= 'cause she doesn't work.

= What?

Hey, so how was your night?

Are you serious right now, Oliver?

Yeah.

Um, hey.

I'm Jess.

Hey.

Who is she?

What are you doing here, Cece?

Sorry, I just came to get Schmidt.

Schmidt left, like, an hour ago.

No, no, I didn't.

Are you kidding me?

My tires were stolen by street youths.

Ugh!

Hey, did I pee my pants?

Friends, did I pee in my pants?

Guys?

No, Kyle, you're just on drugs.

He definitely peed, I can see.

See! See!

Who's the idiot now?

Okay, all of you, get out of here.

I peed my pants.

We got to get out of... oh.

Mmm.

Mmm.

This guy's like a magician.

How does it feel, Oliver?

Okay, uh, Kyle, I'm the one you're gonna sleep with tonight, so we got to...

What are you gonna do now?

Okay, okay.

Okay.

My man!

Get out of my house!

I will m*rder you!

Bye!

What?

Hey, Kyle. Hey.

It's a stick.

Go get it.

Ooh, shiny!

Whoo.

What does a girl got to do to get a one-night stand around here?

Sorry.

This sangria is amazing, Winston.

My grandmother's recipe, so I can't take credit for that.

But seriously, Tia, you don't want a man who has fancier underpants than you.

I keep trying to tell her that.

It's true.

You want to have the fanciest drawers in the relationship.

Boom.

Wow.

Hmm.

Hey, are you gonna be done soon?

Maybe.

She can't keep eating tacos all night.

Yeah.

Because I ate most of the tacos yesterday.

You know what?

I can't do this.

You're a really great guy, and, um, I-I I mean, I don't know that, um, but honestly, I was just gonna use you as a giant meat puppet.

I'm looking pretty good right now.

It's just so hard, you know?

I feel so alone sometimes.

And I lied to you.

I'm not a Web creator.

I'm not a player.

I miss her so much.

Oh, she's in... she's just in the kitchen.

Baby!

Can you make me a smoothie?

You know, just making copies.

Did you do all of this?

I did.

No.

Yeah.

Really?

And I just want you to know that there's a photocopy of my butt somewhere in your recycling bin.

Okay.

I had a weird moment, Julia, and I went for it.

Okay, and if anyone finds it, I want them to know that I moved during the copy, and I don't actually have two butt cracks.

I know.

What?

I've never ever cared about Valentine's Day before.

Neither have I.

But it's nice.

Yeah.

Right?

You did all the work wrong, though.

Yeah, I know I did.

That's okay.

I'm sorry.

No, no, no, do what you got to do.

Hi, Ming.

Yeah, I got your text.

And yeah, it was wrong just like every single other text you've sent me tonight.

Call I call you tomorrow?

Yeah, it's fine, go.

I'm sorry.

Are you really...

Are you arguing with me about that?

Are you actually arguing with me about that?

Bye.

Bye, girl, thank you.

Bye.

Bye, Shel.

That was fun.

Any time.

So, you weren't expecting a girls' night, were you?

Not really.

You know, Tia needed some tough love.

You keep doing it.

What?

Making up for how you used to be.

You don't remember?

Valentine's Day, 2008?

You said you'd call.

You didn't.

Um...

I waited all night.

Okay, I don't deserve a second chance with you, do I?

But here you are.

Getting one.

Oh.

Hey.

Hey, what are you doing home so soon? - Well, I helped him get back together with his ex-girlfriend.

He made me video-chat with his mom in Hawaii for a couple minutes, and then, um, I came home, so...

Jess, you don't your first one-night stand to be with some total stranger.

You got to pick someone who you know, who's not gonna make a big deal out of the whole thing.

Hmm. - You have an urge, you act on it.

And...

whatever you do, leave immediately afterwards.

God help you if you get sucked into a brunch.

Thanks, Schmidt.

Come here.

You smell good.

It's probably the oil of the ylang-ylang tree.

Don't over think it.

Okay.

Don't over think it.

Don't over...

Don't over think it.

Schmidt?

Hey, Jess, what are you doing?

I was asking Schmidt a question.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What?

Were you...?

What? No.

...with Schmidt?

No! No.

I was holding those, but I...

Oh, my God.

What has gotten into you?

No. No.

And why do you have so many condoms?

Shh! Don't ever...

Shh! Don't ever speak of this again.

You need one.

Tops, two. Let's go.

We'll get these later.

I was feeling twirly.

Nick, Nick...

No!

You're not having sex with Schmidt.

NICK This is a danger zone for you.

What is happening out there?

Stop, do not move, okay?

What? Why...? - Because if somebody catches us, I'm gonna say that you drugged me, and it's my word against yours.

Okay?

Okay, yeah.

That-that's fine, that makes sense.

You smell so good right now.

You are not gonna believe the stupid thing I almost did last night.

Tell me.

Okay, but have to promise never to tell anyone, ever.

Of course, out with it.

Tell me.

Okay, I almost tried to hook up with Schmidt last night.

That would have been crazy.

I know!

Can you imagine? Ugh.

I cannot.

I got to go, okay?

Bye.

(Horn honks)

NICK: Hey, hey, hey, man, this is my spot.

I was here first!

That's my space, huh?

This isn't Europe! Move!

Come on. Come on, Nick.

Maybe he's a really nice guy. He's just having a bad day.

I don't care if he's a nice guy.

Get that piece of crap out of my space.

Don't... - Come on, dude. Why don't you come in here, Nick!

...take my pants off...and kiss my ass?

Oh! Oh, my God!

What do you got to say now? Huh?

Oh, my God, it's like The Wire!

He has a g*n. He has a g*n. Stay down.

Oh, my God. You still think he's a nice guy, Jess?

That's what I thought.

Maybe no one's ever been nice to him.

Maybe v*olence is his only tool to express himself.

Hi. - Huh? Get down. What are you doing?!

JESS: Hi. Don't k*ll us.

Don't use g*n!

Stop it. Just stop it. Just get down.

We're sorry. Take the spot.

JESS: Sir...

Just be submissive.

Sorry about this guy.

Don't apologize...

He's overreacting.

I'm overreacting? He has a g*n, and you're dressed like a bull's-eye.

Thank you, sir. Thank you.

I can't believe this is working.

Sorry. - You out-crazied a man with a g*n.

Have a good day.

See, it worked.

You always see the worst in people.

âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl?

âª Who's that girl? âª âª It's Jess.

Here we go again.

Another text message from work. Look at that.

"Tokyo call at 11:00?"

This is driving me crazy!

What is she trying to say?

I'm not an expert at your industry at all, but, um, sounds like there's a call.

From Tokyo.

Sometime today.

Oh, wait. At 11:00.

You don't understand.

I've been getting a lot of mixed signals from my boss lately.

What is wrong with you?

The world is not out to seduce you.

(phone buzzing) "And bring me the budget reports."

Why can't she just say what she wants?

What kind of sick game is she playing?

It's all in your head, man. It's always in your head.

Nonfat vanilla latte.

We're not talking about coffee...

are we?

Three, please.

Are you sure you want me to...

stop at three?

I have a package for Schmidt.

Sir, I'm very flattered, but I must decline.

He said he had a package for Schmidt. JESS: Oh, you're always starting fights with everyone, Nick.

I mean, not everyone's out to get you.

He had a g*n, Jess!

He was literally out to get me.

Isn't Nick the most negative person you've ever met?

Absolutely, and you know what? It all pools up right in that little satinous center below his belly button.

WINSTON: I mean, he's not wrong, though.

His life is genuinely terrible. NICK: You know what, Jess?

I guess I don't live in a world where I smile, and people do what I want them to do.

You never smile.

A smile is a sign of weakness.

(screams, whirring)

No!

All right, everybody relax.

(whirring)

(clanking, Nick groaning)

Get out!

It's fixed.

Okay, Nick, I'm calling the landlord.

Uh-uh.

This is ridiculous.

Don't call the landlord.

We don't need him here, and he's a jerk.

See, here's an example.

Maybe you never gave him the chance to show you what a great guy he is.

Yeah, he's a terrible person. No, Jess. He sucks.

Don't call the landlord, I'm serious.

Okay.

Hey, Kim, where should I put this...

budget... report?

On the desk.

Yeah, um, okay.

I'll just... Thanks. So...

Schmidt, my files need sorting.

Do it here... so I can watch.

Okay.

So, you want me to...

sort... your files?

Is that right?

What are you doing?

What am I...? Hmm? Okay.

Because I probably got this one wet, so I'm gonna re...

I'm just gonna replace all of them.

(scraping)

Knock, knock. Mr. Landlord?

Um, I know you probably think cupcakes are totally lame.

I know I do, so if you could do me a solid and take care of those extras?

Cool office.

I like your...

bucket of...

gasoline.

It's super practical.

What you got there?

Broom.

So, I live in, um, Four D...

There are a lot of real safety hazards in our loft.

Nothing a little landlording couldn't fix.

What do you say?

No.

(water dripping)

That's a sweet picture.

How old are your kids?

I did that.

It's me and my ex-wife.

Okay, you know what? Um...

My roommates are really scared of you, but I know you're a good man, and I know you don't want the four of us living in a dangerous apartment.

The four of you?

Apartment Four D, there's only supposed to be three people.

Oh, did I say four?

You know what?

I was counting myself twice.

It's so easy to do.

Big personality over here, so...

gonna go...

(mutters)

Hey, guys.

I've got a fun exercise.

I'd like everybody to take a moment and think back to a time when they did something stupid, how they were treated, and how they wish they were treated.

What did you do, Jess? LANDLORD (knocking): Open up!

Did you talk to the landlord?

Little bit.

Okay, it's happening. Guys, go.

Ginny. Call me Ginny. Ginny.

Ginny. I'm Ginny. Okay, go.

We'll be right there. Come on, let's go. Go, go. Okay, okay.

NICK: Come on, this is what we trained for, guys.

Go! All the way, all the way, all the way.

Be careful with the duvet, please.

Shut up, Schmidt! I'm freaking out!

Oh, my God. - Told you we didn't practice this enough.

Jess, close those up.

Oh, there goes the chinos.

Oh!

Brad. Coach.

(heavy accent): Oh. Hello. (laughs)

Ginny! I had such nice time visiting Los Angeles.

It's so many fancy people with their fancy lives.

Oh. Hollywood!

Oh.

Oh, good-bye.

Bye, Ginny.

Yeah, Ginny.

Thank you for memories.

Bye, Ginny.

Ginny. You're the best, Ginny.

Oh, I'll miss him.

I love Ginny.

So, someone told me you have four people living here.

NICK:

Well, that idiot probably doesn't know what she's talking about, so...

You don't want... you don't want to go in the library...

Who left the library like this?

You kidding me? Oh!

Know what? This is so embarrassing. Who left the library like...?

This is a mess.

Hey, hey, where you going, my man?

Oh. Hello.

Train to Panama all sold out.

Must be the Mardi Gras.

Good God, what is this?

Why would you do this?

This was Schmidt's room, okay? He painted this.

It is a sexually-charged, zero-gravity tea ceremony.

Paint over it!

Or you pay for it.

(mutters):

He's fair.

Who painted that?

Giancarlo.

Some creepo Schmidt was obsessed with.

He used to wear a le...

I suggest you paint it, and you paint it fast!

Have fun, buddy.

To be honest, I was expecting a lot worse, so just...

Four people is fine.

Just paint over the sex wall, and don't bother me any more.

Hey, sir, wait.

Jess, let.. let him go.

I just want to apologize on behalf of all of us for lying to you about how many people live here.

Stop reminding him.

But while you're up here, might as well just fix a few things.

Please... Remy?

How did you know my name? They call you?

I saw your tattoo that says,

"Hello, My Name is Remy,"

and I just... I took a leap of faith.

Look, I know you're a good guy...

Okay, what do you... what do you want fixed?

Why don't you close your eyes and point at something?

Her. Not you.

Schmidt?

Yeah.

I need you to clean up my hard drive.

Okay, do you want me to reformat first? - I said, I need you...

to clean up...

my hard drive.

I should have seen a divorce coming.

You know, we stopped doing the little things, like talking.

One day, we were humping.

Then everything changed.

We weren't humping.

That must have been really hard.

You know, it was what it was.

Come on, Remy.

It was hard.

It was hard.

Mm.

All right, give it a sh*t.

Great.

Okay. Oh.

Here, I'll help...

I'll brace you. Pull back.

Okay.

Use your hips. Come on.

Okay...

Oh! Oh, that's good.

That's it, is it?

Okay.

That'll do it.

Hey, Jess.

Can I talk to you for a minute alone?

(sighs)

(laughs)

So, what's up? Ready to admit you were wrong?

Hello. My name is Nick, and I like eating crow.

That man wants to sleep with you.

No, he doesn't.

Yes, he does. - He was just showing me how to close a closet.

Okay, anytime a man shows a woman how to do something from behind, it's just an excuse for him to get really close and breathe on her neck.

Watch any sports movie.

That is not a thing.

You mind picking up that mug?

Oh, no, you're doing it all wrong.

Here, let me show you.

No, no, no. I've been doing this for years.

See, the way to pick up a mug is like that.

You just got to relax into it.

He wasn't doing that!

That's exactly what he was doing.

You always see the worst in people!

Yeah, because people are the worst!

Oh, five bucks!

Look out, college. Here I come!

(laughs)

That's it. People stink!

You must have been doing something.

Are you seriously defending the man who pushed me into the bushes?

Well, people can be good.

You just have to give them a chance to show you.


MAN: Hey, little girl. You like candy?

I sure do!

Great!

My nana made way too much!

Why can't you admit you were wrong?

I was nice, and now he's fixing our apartment.

I'm working up an appetite in there.

Boy, I hope you don't mind the smell of a real man in your room.

Let me know when you want to get started on that bed.

Okay.

He's turning my mattress.

Yeah.

This is so wonderful.

Oh, come on.

Don't you ever wear jeans? Honestly, you look like you should be distracting James Bond at a baccarat table.

No, I'm actually gonna go meet Kyle.

Jess loaned her seasickness bracelets.

Going to a party on Greg Kinnear's boat.

You're going to a party on Neptune's Folly?

Yeah, relax. He's not going to be there.

I know, he's in Rio till the 16th.

Cece, can I talk to you, as a...

as a woman?

All right, Schmidt.

Okay.

My boss and I, we're running a Pre-Sex Marathon right now, and I feel like we're stuck in mile 25.

I'm cramping, Cece, my toenails are falling off, I'm peeing down my leg, it's like I can see the finish line, but I just can't get there.

I need to put one of these on right now.

The problem is is we don't talk.

I don't know what she's thinking.

Should I make a move or not?

Stop asking permission and go get it.

That's what I would want.

There's nothing less sexy than a dude asking if he can kiss you.

Nothing? I mean, what if I ate my own hair and pooped out a wig?

What if I called my mom after sex to describe it to her?

What if I had a croissant blog?

Two of these now.

(laughing)

Hey, Bob Ross, how's painting going?

Going absolutely fantastic, Schmidt, because everything is easy...

"when you are a battleship, invading the Bay of Success."

What?

I have here Schmidt's New Year's resolutions from 2007.

Oh, please, read on. NICK: Read my favorite one.

"Stop pursuing Caroline.

"She's Nick's girl.

Deal with it.

"Deal with it." CECE: Wow!

She's my girl.

Okay, where'd you find that?

Do not ever stop reading this.

I was very young. And drunk.

Were you too drunk to "begin the search for the cocoon..." - Cocoon.

...that will one day release your butterfly"?

No, it does not say that one!

That's number three.

Come on!

Why are you doing this to me?

Maybe I just got bored painting over your interplanetary ass dojo.

This is my favorite.

"Find out where Winston gets his sparkle, and then steal it."

Oh!

Steal his...! You were gonna steal my sparkle?

Give me that.

The funniest thing just happened.

I was watching Remy fix the sink, and I got totally soaked.

You were so wet!

Man overboard!

So I invited Remy over for dinner to thank him for all the stuff he's been doing around the apartment. Who's in?

I gotta... I...

I got a boat, so...

So, I guess it'll just be me and Jess.

Oh, no, Remy.

I changed my mind;

I'll be there.

Just watching you.

Remy brought a bottle of...

this?

I ferment things in the basement.

I also make cheese.

Hm, you're not drinking that, Jess.

Yes, I am, Remy made it.

Ahhh.

Think you can handle some, Nick?

Oh, I'm okay.

Somebody needs to stay sober to fight you later.

Nick, be nice;

How hard could it be to just open yourself up a little bit?

Dip your toe in the pool of possibilities.

Yeah, Nick.

Dip your toe.

You guys have a lot in common.

Nick went through a break-up last year that was really hard on him.

Schmidt said your mom had to fly out.

That was a scheduled trip.

Did you smell your girl on your sheets for months until they were too soaked through with your own sweat and tears?

No.

Did you punch out all the windows until you h*t the wall and broke your hand?

Did you go out, looking for companionship, a little human warmth, only to come to in the woods covered in animal blood?

In my own way.

Come here, man.

(sighing, panting)

It's gonna be okay.

Yeah.

Well, I guess I'll just go home and open a bottle of wine.

Yeah, I'll probably just do the same.

(murmurs)

(beeps)

(car alarm blaring)

I want you.

Now.

Finally.

(tires screech)

No, no, no, no, she wanted me to! Oh, dip!

No, no! Stop! Stop hitting him! She wanted me to! Consensual, guys!

Tap out, ow, tap out!

(laughter)

Oh, man, tonight is just...

I-I honestly didn't know if I'd ever enjoy myself again.

So... thanks.

Bathroom break.

(clears throat)

See?

I was right.

What do you mean, you're right?

You're wrong.

You see the way he's buttering me up so he can move in on you?

Why can't you just admit that you were wrong?

How have you lived this long on your own?

There is no part of that man that wants to sleep with me.

He's been creeping on you all night.

No, he hasn't been.

Open your eyes, like, I'm worried...

No!

Oh...

Hey, Remy, what happened to your pants?

I've never done a threesome.

That's what we're doing here, right?

This I did not expect.

I love watching you be wrong, Jess.

I might've been a little bit off about Remy, but people are generally good, and I'm not wrong about that.

Jess, people are jerks.

He is hurting from his divorce...

Are you still making excuses for this guy?

Well, look, if you feel so bad, then just get in there.

Just dip your toe into the pool of possibility.

Hey, Remy, let's get weird and toss that ball around, huh?

So turned on.

Okay, you would seriously have a threesome with that man just to get me to admit that I'm wrong?

I think we could do a lot worse than Remy.

He's got strong arms.

Let's have a threesome.

Ugh...

All right, so, a menage

a trois is about three of us... trois...

Sure.

...Menage-ing fully.

Oui.

Okay.

This is happening with this guy.

This is happening right now, Jess.

Yeah.

So, it's gonna get even a little more uncomfortable.

We just have to keep talking with each other, all right?

Around and communicating.

Let's get some relax music going.

Great idea, great idea.

Okay? All right.

Thank you. Why can't you just admit that he's a good guy?

We are about to have a menage a

trois 'cause you won't admit you're wrong. You're out of your mind.

I'm just saying he's a good guy.

âª

Yeah, get into it.

I am so into this.

I can't wait till we're all menage-ing.

Are you into this, Jess?

Yeah.

Say you're wrong. No, turn this up. It's great.

Say it's over, and it's over.

Don't get nervous, Nick.

This is just a regular conversation we're having.

Oh, yeah.

Except I'm rubbing your back.

That's right.

And then I'm going to start unbuttoning your pants, and then I'm gonna unbutton my shirt.

I'm not gonna take my underpants off, though.

Not right away, I'm gonna keep my underpants on until I let you take my underpants off, Nick.

Okay? Because you are gonna be the underpants captain tonight. - Makes sense.

Great choice, Remy.

Nick will make a fantastic underpants captain.

Let's bring it in.

Okay.

You two get us started.

Me and Jess get it started?

Yeah.

All right?

Us two...

Go ahead.

...getting it started.

You know what to do.

Breathe into each other.

Oh, yeah, Jess.

I'm not here.

Relax into the menage.

Let's get this started, Nick.

You doing this? - Yes.

Come together.

Are you doing this? Cause I'm...

Yes.

I will do it.

All right, okay.

We're gonna do it.

Then let's do this.

Nick, I will do this.

Say that you're wrong, and it's over.

I'm not wrong.

Jess, you can't do this.

But I can.

Okay.

Let's do this, Nick.

Let's do it, Jess.

I can do it.

(muffled yell)

No, okay!

Fine, I admit it, I'm wrong.

Yes! Yes!

I'm sorry, Remy.

REMY:

What, we're not doing this?

JESS: No. NICK: We're not doing it.

I get it, cold feet is just, you know, it's part of the journey, so...

Whoa!

What is going on in here?

All right, I am not ready for a four-way.

That's, uh, I'm-I'm...

I'm out of this.

To be honest, I'm kind of riding a weird ego high.

Why didn't you tell me four people couldn't live in this apartment?

If we're gonna do a shenanigan, I'm fine with doing shenanigans.

I love shenanigans, as long as no one gets hurt.

(loud popping, Jess screams)

Okay, just so we're clear, we're gonna have to live with this, right?

Yep.

Absolutely.

SCHMIDT:

Hey, Kim?

Look, I just wanted to apologize for yesterday.

I hope you didn't get into too much trouble, I just...

I really don't want to lose my job, okay?

I've worked at Associated Strategies for six years.

Nothing means more to me than Ass Strat.

Your lip is bleeding.

It opens back up when I talk.

Look... Kim, this wasn't your standard 2:00 a.m.

mistaken as*ault in the parking garage.

I've had a thing for you every since I was the husky kid in the mailroom.

And if... if you don't believe me...

here you go.

Straight from '07. Read resolution number four.

It's about you.

"Only think about hot new C.F.O. Every other time I masturbate."

I did not live up to the challenge.

Number seven: "Start floating idea that people call me"

"Mr. Finish/Garee Time Jones/

The Hook-up-erator."

Can I...?

Number nine: "Just pick a color of Crocs and buy them already."

Okay, thank you.

Hey.

Go into the conference room and dial me into the Tokyo call.

Now.

Yeah.

âª

Pants! Pants!

(sighs)

(counting in Japanese)

...five, six...

I dialed you into the Tokyo conference call.

(clicks tongue)

(confused murmuring)

Yo... you look awesome.

(elevator bell dings)

My door is always open.

Your sheets are so soft.

They've actually been in my family for almost 40 years.

Wow!

If these old things could talk, huh? Ew.

I was just trying to paint a picture.

Read the room.

Sheez.

Hey, Julia. Hey.

It's so fun having another girl around here.

There are tampons hidden all over the apartment.

Ah! Damp towel! Damp!

Here we go... It's like a really big Wet-Nap.

Ah. I feel like I'm being licked by a golden retriever.

Look at this bathroom.

There should not be two girls in this bathroom.

You're too humid. You make everything damp.

80% of the products in here are yours.

Blah, blah, blah, yawn, yes.

I use sculpting chutney.

Once I'm done with my chutney, back in the row it goes.

Hair everywhere... Yo.

The multicolored rubber bands.

I'm fine with it. It's all okay with me.

But a damp towel is where I draw the line.

Sorry, so what are your thoughts on damp towels?

Oh, you'd better watch it, Nick's Overnight Guest.

Julia. I know your name.

Are you flexing, right now? No.

Hey. Hey.

So, I'm gonna just get ready in your room.

Sure. Feeling a little weird and uncomfortable in here?

Hey, Julia, I'll see you later tonight.

Yeah. See you later.

She's helping me get out of a traffic ticket.

Jess, are you seriously using the girl I'm sleeping with for free legal advice?

Oh, I'm sorry, the girl you're sleeping with?

I mean, you can't call her your girlfriend?

We're not labeling it. Oh, you're not labeling it,

'cause you're too sophisticated.

Don't do your

"sophisticated guy."

That's now how a sophisticated man dances.

How does a sophisticated man dance?

# I'm too sophisticated

# I don't believe in labeling. #

You gotta get laid, man. You gotta get laid, man.

Yeah, I need to get laid.

This is bad. Get out of here.

# Who's that girl?

# Who's that girl? #

# Who's that girl?

# Who's that girl? #

# It's Jess.

You know, maybe I should call Shelby.

I haven't seen her since I got back from Latvia.

We did have an amazing time together.

Whoo! That was amazing.

Yeah. All right, bye.

I'm gonna call her.

Yeah, over in Latvia they had this fermented milk stuff that they drink.

Whole country runs on the stuff. Called.

was definitely one of my biggest endorsements.

I mean, I have a lot of endorsements, but that was probably my biggest endorsement amongst other endorsements that I had.

Wow.

So, um... your place or mine?

What are we laughing at?

How much I'm not going home with you tonight.

You show up after two years, out of the blue, and all you do is talk about yourself.

You don't even let me get a word in edgewise.

Why did you agree to let me take you out for drinks?

Winston, you took me out for a drink at the place where I work!

Here's your bill.

Thanks for the water.

Man, I told you to get yourself whatever you wanted.

You chose water.

Have a seat.

Okay.

Let me get you a blanket.

Why would I want a blanket right now?

Just to get toasty. Oh.

Would you like a cookie, or a cupcake? I made them.

Oh, no. I'm okay. I'm not really a dessert person.

I just don't eat it, usually. Okay. Okay.

I'm just gonna put this, like, right here.

I don't... okay. Just...

Why don't you just take me through what happened with the ticket?

Okay. They got a photo of you?

# At the scene of the crime

# Meh, meh, meh, meh.

Is this it?

Yeah. Okay.

Hmm. This may actually be kind of hard to argue with.

Well, there's actually more there than meets the eye.

Um, there was a bird ... he's not in the sh*t ...

but he was injured, and he couldn't get out of the road, and so I braked, and then I had to accelerate out of the intersection.

You missed your first court date on this.

My ex-boyfriend failed to send it to me before the court date, because he doesn't believe in mail, which has to do with his thoughts on government spending.

Now it's an $800 fine.

That's why I need, like, a really awesome lawyer, like you.

So... can you help me?

I mean, I can try. You never know.

A judge might buy into this whole thing, so...

What "whole thing"?

Your whole thing.

With the cupcakes, and the braking for birds, and... bluebirds come and help me dress in the morning.

Oh, I didn't know I was doing a thing.

It's a great thing. I mean, the big, beautiful eyes, like a scared baby.

I'm sure that gets you out of all kinds of stuff.

Yeah. Yeah, except my peripheral vision's, like, almost too good.

Hey, so...

living here, it's probably fun, right?

Yeah. There are, like, lots of girls coming in and out of this place?

Schmidt's like Ellis Island in the 1800s.

He accepts everyone.

Yeah, and... Winston and Nick...

I probably shouldn't...

Oh, yeah. Well, you don't have to... Plead the Fifth!

No, that's not what... Objection!

Nick, hey! Hey, Julia!

You want to hang out in your room? Sure.

Jess, if you'll excuse us, Julie's about to be very disappointed.

Okay, so I will look at this stuff some more, I-I'll call some people, see what I can do.

Here's your blankie back.

Power blazer. Hey. Ha ha.

What's going on with the ticket?

She has a problem with me, Nick.

Okay? She doesn't like me. What are you talking about?

You don't understand,

'cause you're a guy.

She does not have a problem with you. She's just...

Nick, your girlfriend's not a dessert person.

Hmm.

She said you have

"a whole thing"?

I'm sorry, she doesn't like desserts?

Where is she right now?

Look, I think I know what she meant.

I mean, you do like girly stuff.

I mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.

When I met you, you were wearing a hat made of ribbons.

My ribbon hat. I love that hat.

Screw her. And I'm gonna wear that ribbon hat.

Go get it, right now.

Be right back.

Whoa. There she is.

Nick, where is this bitch?

Gonna smack that lawyer learning right out of her mouth.

Okay, this is getting excessive, guys.

She's actually helping her get out of a ticket.

By being condescending and judgmental?

What did she say?

Ugh, just drop it, Nick.

Okay, what did Julia do wrong?

It's just how girls fight sometimes.

There's a lot unsaid.

Like one time, a girl said to me,

"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots."

Ooh. How did she say it?

"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots."

That is diabolical. I'm really sorry.

And it ruined our friendship.

I mean, I couldn't get over the polka dot incident.

Warning! Spoiler alert.

Somebody unplugged my dehumidifier to plug in their flatiron.

I will be putting my dehumidifier, and my towel, in my room, where nothing ever gets wet.

All right, you know what, Jess? Julia's one of those girls where she doesn't have, like, a lot of girl friends.

Because she thinks like a guy. She doesn't play mind games.

So blind! Look, all I know is she's totally up front with me.

No subtext, no codes.

Oh. Okay. So did she come right out and ask you if you were seeing other girls?

Because... she asked me.

She did? You didn't know that?

'Cause I thought you guys were so up front with one another.

I thought you guys told each other everything. Yeah.

She told him she didn't want to label it.

Oh. I mean, that's a classic move, even in the lesbian community.

What are we talking about?

Did you just hear the phrase

"lesbian community"

and come running out of your room?

I did. Uh...

question, for you.

This community you speak of, do the ladies look, uh...

more like this one or, you know...

kind of Nickish? Aw, shut up, Schmidt.

I did date a woman who looked a lot like Nick.

You did. Felicia.

Why can't you just admit that she's your girlfriend?

I know, I just thought it was uncomplicated, and now I'm freaking out.

I'm not good at being a boyfriend.

I'm good at being that guy that you find yourself spending more and more time with until you meet your husband.

All right. So, so far, Nick Miller's list of fears is sharks, tap water, real relationships.

And blueberries. Barkeep.

Get this man a drink.

Ladies, he hasn't had sex in four months.

Come and get it, ladies.

I seriously hate you, Schmidt. Why?

It didn't go well with Shelby?

I gotta say, I thought it would be easy.

You know? Maybe...

maybe I don't have game. Maybe I never had game.

Maybe it's always been about basketball.

Yeah, you don't have any game.

It's always been because you play basketball.

Are you seriously just realizing that you don't have game?

What is your secret, man? How do normal guys get girls?

Let's not say "normal."

Just, you know, say what it is ... "average."

You've had the most game, out of any of us.

Because for years now, you've been working with absolutely nothing.

He makes a good point. Okay.

I've been working with nothing. Zilch.

You're right, I've got nothing.

Except this.

Ow.

Oh, my God.

Miller! No Cocktail!

Sorry, Julio.

Julia! Hey, Julia!

Hey.

Ooh. You guys are using names?

That's not too labelly for you?

Hey. Hey, hey, Jules.

Hey.

Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

Oh, I didn't know we were doing drop-bys.

Uh...

Here's a scenario that's paid sexual dividends, particularly in the Asian markets, and I think, Jess, you can back me up on this.

Inform her that you're an aerialist for the Cirque du Soleil.

Winston, just ask questions, pay attention to her, listen to her, don't listen to him.

Oh, believe me, I don't take advice from Schmidt.

Never have, never will. Ever.

So Jess told me what you asked her yesterday. What?

That you asked if I was sleeping with other people.

That is not even... I... what?

I don't want to play games. That's not what happened, okay?

I just said something to h, because I was feeling kind of guilty, because I'm, uh...

I'm dating other people, and I just, you know... wanted to see if you were also dating other people.

You're dating other people?

Yeah, yeah.

No. No, I'm seeing other people, too.

Good. Good.

I'm having sex all the time. I'm like a mailman.

Except instead of mail, it's hot sex that I deliver.

I've had to start carrying, like, athletic shoes in my purse, 'cause I have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another.

Can't wear heels.

Well, I'm having sex right now.

Under the bar.

And she's on top.

So figure that out.

Was that her?

Yeah.

Well, great. Great.

Then we're both doing the exact same thing.

And we're on the same page.

Kudos for not putting labels on things.

That is exactly what I want. It's my dream.

Just going to go to the bathroom really quickly.

Okay. Great.


Hey. Julia?

Are you serious?

Did Nick say some stuff to you?

Because I'm really sorry, and I want to explain...

Why would you tell him that I said that?

Do you know what that makes me look like?

Um...

I see what you're doing.

I know that I'm the mean lawyer girl who wears suits and works too much and you... you're the really fun teacher girl with all the colorful skirts and you bake things.

And eventually, Nick is going to come running to you and you'll tuck him in under his blankie and...

What is it with you and the blankie thing?

I never said the word blankie.

I don't talk like Teddy Ruxpin.

If I acted the way that you act when I was at work, nobody would listen to me.

Well, if I acted like you at work, my students would turn in really weird, dark dioramas, so...

I don't like you.

And I don't want to be your friend, so...

Fine. Can you leave, please?

Because...

I am about to start crying, and you are the last person that I want to cry in front of.

I want to cry, t, and...

where am I supposed to cry?

You can't monopolize the bathroom crying space.

Please go.

What are you doing, Jess?

Get out! I'm sorry.

Winston, what are you doing? Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

I have come here to listen to you.

Should I have interrupted you to tell you that?

Probably not.

So how... how are you?

Tell me about your life, and how is everything?

Winston, what am I supposed to do?

I was a booty call for two years, and then I was nothing for two years.

You show up bragging after all this time like nothing has changed.

What do you want me to think?

That I'm an idiot.

And you know what?

You're right, and I'm sorry.

It's just that since I've stopped playing ball, I realize I'm not that good at this.

And, quite frankly, you are way out of my league.

That is clear now.

But... I do hope this is not the last time I see you, but whatever you want, I'm cool with.

I got to get back to work.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll help you.

See?

I'm the manager.

Oh, you're the manager? Yeah.

Wow, that's amazing. It's okay.

Case 73.

Mr. Sandoval.

I see you have dressed for the occasion.

Oh. Hi.

You didn't have to come.

I'm sure you're very busy.

I said that I would be here, so I'm here. Don't worry.

I think I can handle it. Let's just get this over with so we can get out of here.

Your Honor.

Your Honor.

Your Honor.

These are the facts, Your Honor.

# Your Honor.

Case 74 ... Jessica Day.

Yes, sir. Yes, I'm present, sir. Okay, listen.

You just have to enter the plea yourself, all right, and then I'll do the rest.

Okay, okay. I got it, all right?

So you know, all you have to do is say... I got it! Thank you.

Okay. Okay. How do you plead?

Guilty. What?

Great. Pay your fine upstairs.

Well, I guess we're never going to know if the bird defense works.

Such a bummer, too.

We have this pool at my office.

Okay. Hey!

I got something to say to you, man.

What?

I brake for birds.

I rock a lot of polka dots.

I have touched glitter in the last 24 hours.

I spend my entire day talking to children.

And I find it fundamentally strange that you're not a dessert person.

That's just weird, and it freaks me out.

And I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown.

And I hate your pantsuit.

I wish it had ribbons on it or something to make it just slightly cuter.

And that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong.

Okay.

And I know you like Nick, and I'm not trying to interfere, but you should just talk to him about it.

Are you done?

I am almost done.

I'm about to go and pay this $800 fine, and my checks have baby farm animals on them, bitch.

That's the wrong way.

You moved.

You remember my old place?

The place in the hood?

No.

It was hood-adjacent. Whatever.

So, um... so this was nice.

Yeah, it was.

You want to know what I want to do now?

What?

Take you on a real date.

Why don't you call me?

Good night, Winston.

Winston, what's happening? Huh?

Yeah, good night.

What is wrong with you, man?

You got no game. That was so stupid.

Hey! Anyone!

My towel!

Can someone please get my towel?

It's in my room next to my Irish walking cape.

The... the bigger towel.

Not... do not touch the small one.

Okay, I left my towel in my room.

Nobody look.

Nobody look, yo.

We don't want to. Nobody look.

Seriously, no... no one's looking?

All right, forget it.

Aah! Damn it! See, he's a natural blond.

What shape is that supposed to be shaved into?

Think he's trying to force perspective.

Very funny. I got to get something off my chest.

No, Schmidt, there is an apron right over there ... go cover yourself.

You are Jewish. You're making me gayer.

Are you going to go on, like, a big wet towel rant?

No. This is now a sex rant.

To wit, six months ago, I thought getting a girl roommate would mean sex all the time ...

definitely with her friends and probably with her.

Are there women here?

Yeah, sure, more than ever.

But you ... not going to happen.

You, I will never give up.

And you... well, you sample from the gumbo pot.

I am in a damp bathroom full of naked women every day, and I hate it.

It's like a nightmare. I'm in a...

watermelon-themed apron with a...

A tampon?

Why would you need this for cooking?

I just had an idea.

Why don't we hang our towels on towel bars instead of hooks, and that'll make them dryer?

That is the...

that is... that is a great idea.

Quick question for you.

As a lesbian gynecologist, perhaps, one of these days, the two of us could sit down and talk about OSI.

What is OSI? Our shared interest.

Schmidt, clothe yourself! All right, all right.

It was just a suggestion.

Oh.

Hey. Hi.

Nick's not here.

That's okay.

Uh, because I came here to...

well, I kind of came because I-I thought it would be good if you and I...

Hey, Jess, my hands are actually stuck in the yarn because... Oh.

I didn't realize that you had people over. Sorry.

No, it's just... crochet time.

Yeah.

Nick's not here right now. No, I know.

Thanks.

I'll just come back later.

Hey, Julia.

Do you want to crochet with us?

I mean, growing up was brutal.

I went to an all-girls school.

The worst ... girls can be so mean to each other.

Yeah, Cece and I hid in the bathroom for four years.

This is... this is really nice, guys.

Thank you for letting me join in.

It's totally relaxing.

Except that I don't know why, if I put the fox through the cave, it doesn't... the yarn is broken.

I don't know why this is not turning into...

What you making?

A hat.

If you're making a hat for a baby, it is done.

Yeah.

Hey, Julia.

What are you doing here?

Could I talk to you for a second?

Okay.

Hey, Julia.

Stop.

No, there's something that I need to say to you.

All right. Then go ahead.

Okay. Okay.

I'm going to say it.

Okay, I... Just say it.

All right. I-I wanted to say that...

I don't want to date anybody else.

I just want to date you.

Well, that's what I was going to say to you.

Really? Yeah.

So, then... so, then, what does that mean?

You're, like, my boyfriend now?

I'm not really into labels.

Yeah, all right.

Boyfriend.

That's so lame.

You're totally going to...

carry my books home from school.

I will if you wear my leatherman jacket.

It's "letterman" jacket. No, I'm pretty sure it's a leatherman jacket. You letter...

The leather sleeves that the football guys wear?

I'm right. I'm right.

I'm glad you pitched a fit, because my towel is very dry.

I didn't pitch a fit. I just...

Damp!

Damn it!

Everybody ... bathroom now!

What's up, Dad?

What, Schmidt? Is someone playing a joke on me?

Honestly, why is my towel still damp?

cause it's not your towel;

it's my towel, Schmidt.

No, it's not your towel. Your towel is the red one.

I'll tell you this, pal.

I've never used that.

I do use that one every single day.

Oh, God.

This towel's so warm and fluffy.

It's like it's been in the sun forever.

This means you two have been drying your junk with the same towel. Intimate.

Are you out of your mind?! What do you mean, am I...

How do you think this is your towel? Do you even wash it?

No, I don't wash the towel;

the towel washes me.

Who washes a towel?

You never wash...? You wash your towel?

You never wash the towel? What am I going to do?

Wash the shower next? Wash a bar of soap?

You got to think here, pal. I'm furious right now.

I get out of the damn shower, I'm clean as a damn baby, and I use the towel. Let me ask you this.

Have you been wearing my underpants?

Sometimes, yeah. Who cares?

You guys don't wear each other's underpants?

You're lying. We all wear each other's underwear.

$50 in the douche bag jar?

Absolutely, man.

Yes, absolutely.

Why so much?

I feel like it should actually be more in the 100, 200 range, so that's a discount.

Think about what you did, Schmidt.

I lost it.

I lost the party bus.

The party bus for your birthday party?

Yeah.

Apparently, my business isn't as important as Frankie Muniz's.

They canceled my rez.

There's nothing I can do;

The party's off.

You should torch them on Yelp.

Actually, I can do it.

I have an account under the name Fantastic Jacques.

He's a French diplomat with very little patience.

Or you could just get another bus.

In two days?

Okay, yeah, sure, Winston.

W-Why don't I just go down to the party bus store, where all the party buses have a state-of-the-art sound system, a stripper pole, a love grotto, and a steering wheel in the shape of a boob.

You honk the nipple.

It's pretty awesome.

Just have the party at a bar.

Nick, this is it.

This is my 29th birthday party.

This is the year. After this, I don't know, it's just... just all darkness.

Was he crying a little?

âª Hey, girl âª
âª What you doing? âª
âª Hey, girl âª
âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

Hey, I just came to make sure you're okay.

I'm not okay, Jess.

I had to cancel my birthday party.

It's social su1c1de.

I can feel my it factor going away.

And then what am I gonna tell Benjamin?

Why are you so worried about Benjamin?

He's your friend.

We have a very weird, girl-style friendship where we kind of hate each other.

We're bronemies.

He's my fremesis.

I'm so confused right now.

Okay, look, Benjamin and I... we were suitemates in college.

Benjamin, I can't wait to get to L.A.

We're going to have so much sex...

in the morning, in the afternoon, at bedtime.

Mmm, peanuts.

I'm telling you, man, I'm gonna run that town one day... You'll see.

I'm gonna write you a check right now for $100 million.

How do you like that?

Damn, dude.

And this is a real check.

You can cash it when I'm rich and awesome.

Give me about four years.

Do the song.

âª We built this Schmidty âª
âª We built this Schmidty on Tootsie Rolls. âª

If it wasn't for Benjamin, I, I never would have become a Los Angeles baller.

Holla.

I changed everything about myself, Jess.

I lost all the weight, I changed my clothes, I even dropped my voice half an octave, but it wasn't enough.

I guess I'll just never be cool enough, Jess.

Okay, I've got it.

We are going to throw Schmidt a birthday party. - No.

Yes, 'cause it's his 29th birthday and we care.

Jess, Schmidt's world is different than ours.

They speak a different language.

They shorten every word to one syllable.

Okay, he once called an oven an "ovs."

He calls an airport "airp."

He called ketchup "ketch."

Last month he went to a party called Bros before Hos on the Moon.

What does that even mean?

And the dress code was "yacht flair."

What?

Schmidt has a friend who legally changed his middle name to Doin' It.

Yeah, Doin' It.

Just one word: Doinit.

You are not emotionally, ment*lly, and spiritually prepared to throw these d-bags a party.

I'm gonna do some research.

Actually, I'm sorry, I do have to go.

I apologize.

Where are you going?

And why are you wearing your jury duty pants?

I'm not, man, I'm just... mumble, mumble, mumble.

Come on, lawyer party...

the classic fifth date.

What are you talking about?

I'm not gonna apologize for it.

I got nothing to apologize for.

I owe you nothing.

No, I'm having a really fun time.

I love wearing a Bill Cosby sweater in front of a bunch of lawyers who are younger than me.

Hello, I'm Bill Cosby, do you like pudding?

My son's name is Theo and his best friend is Cockroach.

That supposed to be Bill Cosby?

That's as good as I can do.

Let's see yours.

Would you like to hear How he really sounds?

Yes.

I want to get some more pudding.

That's the worst Bill Co... How about this?

I got a daughter named Rudy Huxtable, and she's the cutest of all my daughters.

I'm really glad that you're here with me.

Yeah, I'm happy you let me be here with you.

No, I really am because I got to, like, kiss all the asses of these 24-year-

old law students to try to get 'em to work here.

I went to law school.

You went to law school?

Yes.

I quit. Yes.

Quit law school... why?

Because I realized I hated lawyers.

He says to the lawyer.

And for some reason I find you ridiculously attractive for saying that.

Why don't you kiss my ass, then?

Look, Julia, I got turned around.

I thought we were doing a flirty back-and-forth...

I'm actually just kidding.

I really do want to do that.

Oh, you would?

Well, we can make that happen.

Great.

Let's go.

Let's go to your place.

Want to go to your place?

Do you mind?

Are you married or what?

No, no, no, n-no, no, no, n-no, I'm not married.

I am the opposite of married.

Before you, there was like, there was like nothing.

I've got, like, no girls on the horizon.

In a hot way.

Why don't you ever invite me to your place or, like, tell me all that much about yourself?

It's weird... I don't even know where you live.

I'm 30 years old, and I live in a loft with three roommates.

In a hot way.

But maybe you can kiss my butt when I talk like Bill Cosby.

All right, let's go.

Is that going to work?

Uh-huh.

Wow, weird stuff works with you.

Hi, yes, I'd like to order a last-minute stripper.

Oh, um, preferably of Asian heritage, very bendy, with a heart of gold and a crotch of gold.

Mm-hmm, yeah, I'll hold.

Hey, Jess, Winston, this is Julia.

Oh.

Hi.

We're just saying hi.

Nice to meet you guys.

Welcome to our home. Hold on one second.

We're doing a surprise party for Schmidt.

Who is that?

Oh, I didn't tell you about Schmidt?

No.

That's our other roommate.

Other roommate.

You know what? You should come.

It's on Saturday.

Yes.

Cool, yeah.

You should stay as far from that party as possible.

Is it like a presents thing or more like a donations to charity situation?

No?

Just bring yourself.

Do you want to head to my room for a little bit?

Give you the rest of the tour around the place.

Great, yeah.

Great.

Bye.

Hold on one second.

Hey, Winston, why'd you do that?

Are you hiding her from us?

Like, are you ashamed of your friends?

100%, and you're not my friend right now.

You're my enemy, Winston, my enemy.

Give me a kiss, give me a kiss.

No, that's the problem.

Thank you, Ms. Phatbooty, you're the best.

Yes, I just hired my first stripper.

Anything else I should get?

Do you like jazz cigarettes?

Hi, Tanya.

Patti told me that...

Patti told you to break in my office to look for drugs?

Hey, JK kidding, JK kidding.

You can do whatever you want.

I didn't know you liked to shop at the Confiscation Station.

So what are you looking for... grass?

'Cause I can do a locker search on Monday.

Monday's too late because...

Oh, so what do you got cooking this weekend, huh?

You have to tell me;

I'm your boss.

What is it, a list thing, Paperless Post?

I'm free Friday, but I can also make Saturday or Sunday work.

Jess, what are you doing?

I'm making an egg yellows omelet.

The shallots and gouda are going to congeal.

I can't... what is this?

Happy birthday!

It's a party bus.

I'm so excited.

Whoa, Jess, you really did all this for me?

Okay, so...

over here is kosher yogurt and honey.

Kosher yoge?

We got some condoms Over here... small, medium, large, whatever your preference.

Well, I would use...

I don't want to know.

And the R-rated section in the back with the stripper pole.

It's normally used for s*ab, but tonight it's going to be used for $50 worth of seminudity.

Coincidentally, I'm wearing my lap dance pants.

This is, like, your world, huh?

No...

It is.

It's you in your natural habitat, it's fascinating.

I'm just here for Schmidt. I don't know any of these people.

Nicholas, what's up, N-word?

Don't call me "N-word."

I don't know this guy.

How's your family in Chicago?

Really good, thanks for asking, they're all healthy.

That's good.

Oh, look at this big old pile of birthday Schmidt.

Hey, do you mind if I get a ride on your school bus?

I don't want to be late for first period.

Why you got to do me like that, Been-ja-meen?

What's up, boys?

What up?

Why don't you sing us your birthday song?

Oh, you have a birthday song?

All right, all right, guys, come on.

Sing it, come on.

âª We built this Schmidty âª
âª We built this Schmidty âª
âª On rock... âª
âª On Tootsie Rolls. âª

Is that the lyrics?

Yeah, we used to make him sing that because he was fat.

You know I'm just playing at you.

Yeah, hilarity, my man, hilarity.

Yeah, come on, man.

You really live with that guy, huh?

Yeah, I really do.

Does he, like, tuck his shiny jeans into boots when he goes out at night?

You know, the truth is, I met Schmidt a long time ago when we were in college and he was this sweet, chubby communications major who wore cargo shorts and...

Yeah.

I'm actually just messing with you.

Seriously, I think all of your friends seem completely awesome and nice and fun, so relax.

You don't have to say that.

-They're my friends, you can tease 'em.

-I don't want to tease them.

I tease them all the time, they don't care.

Schmidt's a d-bag, you know, but, like, not in a bad way, and, like, Jess is a total nut.

Oh...

And Winston is like this competitive maniac who loves Sister, Sister and he's, like, afraid of thunder.

But I'm the voice of re...

Behind you, he's behind you, He's behind you.

Right now he is?

Currently.

And he's also one of my best friends.

Oh, no, keep going.

You want to go on the bus?

Yeah, let's go on the bus.

I'm really sorry, man, I was just saying that to show off for her.

Oh, no, man, I am bringing you down.

Don't bring me down.

Bro juice?

Vodka pom, right?

Winston said it was a tradish.

Look, Benjamin's smiling.

Jess, you did so good.

Is this stripper pole weight-bearing?

Looks like some pretty shoddy workmanship on the cap flange.

Can I help you?

Martin Fuller, GrindPalace.com.

Hi, I'm Jessica Day.

I spoke with your supervisor on the telephone.

Um, are you bringing the stripper?

'Cause I really wanted to see her jugs first, you know, just so... um, I do right by my bro.

We have a little miscommunicado.

Did you make the call?

Because if they hear a woman's voice, then they send me.

I'm your stripper, folks.

Hey, need to clear this aisle.

I got to have a perimeter.

It's a joke... no.

Please, please, please, no, you can't.

Are you the birthday boy?

You are going to love it.

I do wet towel tricks.

Nobody likes wet towel tricks.

No, he does not love wet towel tricks.

I don't judge, pal. I just want to have fun.

We're not... No. Sir, you are not gonna...

I don't want to be rude, but, uh, times are hard.

It is Saturday night, so if I get hired to take my clothes off, I'm gonna get naked.

So, I'll just put my gym bag down, and I'll take my pants off.

No, no, I'll handle it.

Hey.

Hey, Mr. Fuller.

Mr. Fuller.

Mr. Fuller?

Oh, no.

It's getting a little nippy out.

Not a good time to start turtling.

Come on.

Jess, make it stop.

I'm gonna pay you...

$50 to never show us your penis.

But what about tips?

I make my living on tips.

Well, can you do anything else for the money?

I'm a baritone at my gospel choir at First Presbyterian.

Everybody, everybody...

hey!

Welcome to Schmidt's 29th!

Safety is of the utmost importance, so the person sitting next to you is gonna be your bus buddy for the night.

Any time you're up and about, please wear one of these fashion helmets.

And I brought drugs.

Tanya has half a pot cookie, so maybe she'll share.

Okay, everybody, have fun!

Martin, sing us out.

âª Oh, when he comes âª
âª Oh, when he comes âª
âª He's gonna come for you âª

No stripping!

âª Oh, sweet salvation! âª
âª Oh, when he comes... âª

$50. I've never put $50

in the douche bag jar.

Well, that's really impressive, Schmidt, considering.

Someone's personalized condoms just came in the mail.


Hey! Jar! $20.

Winston, did you know that NWA didn't stand for "Never Walk Alone"?

$30. Jar.

Hey, man.

No! Jar, Schmidt.

Jar!

For what?

Somehow, Schmidt, you've outdone yourself this time.

It was my birthday.

I was very drunk.

All right, everybody, I think we need to take sh*ts.

A little bro-juice sh*t for Benjamin!

What?

For Benjamin is a true...

I'm the king!

Winston and Nick, come and get your bro juice!

Bro juice!

Bro juice! Bro juice!

Bro juice?

I have no idea.

Really?

Yeah.

Nick Miller invented bro juice on Schmidt's twenty-second birthday. Remember that?

Bro juice.

Bro juice! Bro juice!

Get over here for your bro juice!

This is not gonna be attractive.

Oh, yeah!

You know, we're way too old for this, don't you? - Oh, definitely.

Happy birthday, brother.

Yeah!

Happy birthday, Schmidty!

Yeah!

Bro juice!

Bro juice!

When I say "Par," you say "Tay."

Par.

Tay!

Par.

Tay!

Holla!

What am I doing?

It makes you think, huh?

Twenties... they're almost over, man. It's crazy.

Are you hitting that?

Jess?

Yeah.

No.

Well, then I think I'll help myself.

To sex... with your friend.

No, no, no, Benjamin, you can't.

Not with Jess. Please don't.

Well, I can. I can, and I will.

Good evening, night owls.

It's about to get bubonic in here, for tonight, we're going to...

The Plague.

Sorry. Just... It's just Plague.

It's a discotheque.

We'll be going there next.

Whose list are you on? Tristan's?

Isn't it just like a bar or something?

What do you pull down a year in the game?

Ever since I started doing full frontal, I pull down seven K a year easy.

Why? You interested in the life?

Me? A male stripper? Come on. You're too kind.

But you know, theoretically, if I were to get into the game, you know, what are they looking for in the gator department?

You know what I mean?

Or is it just moving so fast that it doesn't really matter?

It's all about storytelling, taking 'em on a journey.

Let me ask you some basics.

When you thrust, what's your range of motion, side-to-side?

Well, left... right-right.

What about your testicles?

Are they more or less symmetrical?

Size... yes, location... no.

What about your persona?

What? Fireman or a cop?

I didn't ask you your character.

Your persona.

I'm a Wolf-Hawk. What are you?

Luxury. Dessert.

I'm a warrior poet, man.

That's it.

Got a number for you to call.

You ever hook up with the ladies?

It's ladies, like, one out of ten times at most.

You're dancing for dudes?

Yeah, I'm dancing for dudes.

All right, I'm sorry, okay?

You're so quiet. You're having a terrible time.

I don't mean to be. I'm probably just intimidated.

I'm sitting right next to the inventor of bro juice.

I get it, okay?

That's... I'm gonna brag about that.

I did. I invented bro juice, okay?

And now you want... You're done.

What?!

I get it. When we get off the bus, it's over, I blew it.

It's ridiculous. I don't care about any of it.

I really don't. Everyone's got embarrassing stuff.

I mean, I have stuff that you don't know about.

Like what?

Just don't lie to me about stuff, and we'll be fine.

Fine.

When I work out, which isn't often, Uh-huh.

I listen to Huey Lewis because it pumps me up.

Not ironically. Want to hear something else?

Okay.

I don't believe dinosaurs existed.

I've seen the science. I don't believe it.

Want to hear something else?

No, I think I'm good.

And I believe you, and I appreciate all of this truth-telling.

I don't think you have stuff.

All right.

You're just perfect.

Uh... yeah.

Hey. Scootch.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

So, I texted Tristan.

Oh, o-okay.

He said he could get us into Plague.

Oh, that's-that's terrific.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Well, just you and me, of course.

So why don't you ditch that zero and get with the hero?

The hero is my penis.

Oh. Uh... no.

Am I bad?

No.

Hey, Benjamin.

Just leave her alone.

Schmidt, your party is slugs, bro.

All right, you know what?

Schmidt, this party... is the worst.

No, man.

This party is badass, all right?

Don't act like I didn't see you over there eating on the charcut... the charcut... the charcut?

Charcuterie.

Charcuterie.

Charcuterie. Don't act like I didn't see you eating the charcut...

Charcuterie.

Charcuterie...

Hey, you know what, Curly?

You don't like the bus, then get off it, pal.

Schmidty's birthday, bud.

You guys suck.

Let me talk to him for a sec.

I'm a lawyer.

Please.

She's a lawyer.

Hi. Why don't you just say that one more time?

What? You guys suck?

Look out! Look out!

Oh!

Whoa!

Oh!

Is everyone okay?

Yes. No worries, Jess.

Is everybody okay?

I'm so sorry.

What, are you nuts?

Oh, God.

Who are you?

Whoo!

Tanya, please stop flashing the driver.

What, are you like the Bourne Identity person?

I've got these iss...

like, these anger management issues.

Anger management?

But I'm trying to fix it.

I go to all these class...

They're court-ordered classes, but...

And what was, like, all this stuff you...?

It's martial arts.

I started doing martial arts, ironically, because I thought it would give me a little bit more Zen in my life.

You must be really freaked out right now.

Yes, I am really freaked out.

I'm so sorry.

I hate that I'm so turned on by your craziness, but I, um...

Go with it.

I'm going with it.

You guys sure you're cool waiting for the tow truck?

Yeah, it's fine. I'll see you back at the loft.

Bye, guys. Happy birthday.

Thank you.

Bye, Julia.

Bye, Bro Juice.

Thank you for that.

Bro-J, my man.

So, it's my birthday.

Right now?

Right now.

Happy birthday.

Happy birthday, Schmidt.

I'm 29, folks. What's up?

29!

29!

Can you please not tell anybody I just did that?

That feels embarrassing.

Actually, you know what? I don't care what people think.

Do you think I care too much about what people think, Jess?

Maybe a little bit.

Maybe.

What? Did you have fun tonight?

'Cause I know it was a little bit... flawed.

Jess, are you kidding me?

Tonight was... tens across the board.

No splash.

Good.

No. For real, I had...

Nobody's ever done that for me before.

Any time, Schmidt. Any time.

Schmidt, why are you looking at me like that?

Shh.

'Cause you had... you had fuzz on your face.

No, no, because I thought...

Oh, my God.

You had a piece of fuzz on...

Oh, my God! Jar.

Schmidt!

You had a piece of fuzz, and...

It was a little piece of fuzz.

You tried to kiss her?!

It was right there and just...

Just put it in the jar, Schmidt.

Yeah, come on. No excuses, Schmidt.

Okay. For you... for you guys.

Happy birthday.

29!

Ten more.

Sorry about that.

Ah, Frankie Muniz.

Ooh, Jess, I just found a Groupon for hypnosis lessons.

Think about what you can do with that.

Sex stuff.

Jar.

Look, guys, has anyone seen my good pea coat?

Jar!

Have you seen my sharkskin laptop sleeve? - Jar!

Darn it! Has anyone seen my croquet cleats?

Hey, Jess, have you seen my other timepiece?

Nick, I came up with the best name for an uncircumcised penis.

Bishop in a turtleneck.

Ugh! Jar!

Damn it! I can't find my driving moccasins anywhere.

I can't believe Jess got roller skates for Christmas.

I feel so free.

Don't. See this.

"Merry Christmas, Brendan. Don't swallow these. Love, Uncle Nick."

It's a great gift. He's a 12-year-old kid, it's a bunch of tacks. He's going to love 'em.

Give it to me.

I hate Christmas.

First of all, it means that Hanukkah is over.

Second of all, I hate it when you guys leave and go home.

When are you leaving?

Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

I think 4:00 a.m.

Is that it? Schmidt, don't worry about it, man, we're all gonna hang out tonight at your office party.

Please tell me you're not dressing up like Santa this year, are you?

I'm the only man in the office.

Of course I'm gonna dress up like Santa.

Look, I like it.

I get all this dirt on my coworkers.

They get drunk and they whisper what they want for Christmas in my ear, and then I use that information to subtly undermine them and control them for the rest of the year.

Ah, the true spirit of Christmas.

Winston, you'd better watch it, man, because I will take you down.

You want to go? You want to go?

You're gonna take me down? I had figure skating lessons until I was 13, and then my mom sobered up and realized I was a boy. Let's do this.

You should not have said that. Hey, guys, guys, don't fight.

Let's go. You're wearing roller skates.

I'm telling you, man. Both of you, enough, hey, hey.

Nothing's smart about what you guys are doing.

Why don't you both act like grown-ups?

No, no.

I need your help right now.

I need you guys to get in my car and come with me to the mall 'cause I really need to figure out what to buy Paul for...

You guys are all wearing the holiday gifts I gave you.

No, I...

That is so sweet.

I need to take a picture.

Jess, don't take a photo right now.

So cute.

Don't do the photo.

Please, no pictures.

So cute, so cute.

New Girl S01E09

"The 23rd"

==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==

So why can't you figure out what to get your boyfriend Paul?

I don't know.

Maybe 'cause we've only been going out for, like, a month, so I know it's not something fancy.

But do I get him a gag gift or do I get him something sweet?

I don't know.

Well, I think you got to figure out what you feel about him and then get a gift that reflects it.

I think that's kind of the move.

My initial thought was to get him a gift certificate for piping hot sex.

Really... oh, you're being serious?

But I don't want him to think that I'm using him for his body.

I'm sure he'd be okay with that.

"Nerdy weird sex that works for both of us."

Give it back.

This is amazing.

No, come on.

I'm gonna keep this.

I'm gonna cash this in one night and get some weird nerd sex with it. No, but it's not for you.

Oh, my God, thank you.

Now I know what I'm getting my mom.

Oh, my God, Nick. It's going right to my mom.

Why do we have to go to this office party tonight?

Because it's the last night before you guys go home to your families, and we got to blow this thing out, man.

Plus, it'll be a good opportunity for you to do some networking.

Help with the job search.

I'm telling you, everybody's hitting the nog, having a good time, letting loose.

You swoop in there, and then boom... new job, man.

That's how things work.

You know, Benjamins in your pocket, La Pen-si-own, little four-to-the-oh-

to-the-one-to-the-kay.

You're making me want to stay broke.

So what'd you get Paul?

I'm not telling you, but, um, I'll give you a hint.

It's fuzzy.

Well, I hope you didn't listen to Nick.

He's the worst gift giver ever.

You're welcome.

Where are we, Jess?

We are on Candy Cane Lane.

At night, the whole block lights up

with Christmas decorations.

It's so beautiful.

Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.

What fun, what wonderful fun.

Okay, whatever.

We have to come back later

'cause you'll see what I'm talking about.

Oh, no, we're not gonna have time.

We have to go straight from the party to the airport.

No.

Yes, I've missed my flight four years in a row.

If I miss it this year, my mom's gonna k*ll me.

Schmidt, it's a menorah for you.

Oh, a menorah.

Judaism, son.

Hey, hi.

You look awesome.

It's a before and after for a Bolivian diet pill.

El Glatrax? Yeah, I've taken that.

I'm "before."

Su-Sure, you are, look at that.

So you said you wanted to see me for something?

Yes, I brought you a gift.

I hope you appreciate that I have kept eye contact with you this whole time and made no reference to the fact that you are basically naked.

Very proud of you, Schmidt.

Hey, hey.

Oh, lot of tongue.

Done with her hair? With her...?

No, I'm not the hair guy, man.

Oh, no, no, no, this is my very good friend Schmidt, and he just came by to bring me a gift, so...

It's perfume.

Why does it say "Cecilia Number 5"?

Actually, it says that because... you know, I ma... I made it specifically for you.

Yeah, I found this place on Third Street where you can design your own perfume.

Base notes of cocoa because of your brown, uh...

ness.

Sea salt, because it kind of sounds like Cece.

Uh, and sandalwood...

Sandalwood... always up to no good.

That's, um...

Ha.

Thank you. Yeah.

Thanks. Neat.

Let's get back to work.

Yeah, okay, um...

I'll see you tonight.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll just... I'll see you there.

We'll do that.

Three, two, one.

Go.

Envelope.

Festive bag. I was afraid you were going to get me jewelry, so...

Oh, no.

What is it?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, two tickets to Vienna and passes to the Salzburg Music Festival?

That's, like, incredible.

You're gonna love it.

I'm speechless.

And, um, all I got you was...

"Anatomically correct heart of a 50-year-old nonsmoker."

You know what?

Normally I'm, like, really good at giving gifts, and I thought that was romantic, but it's just... so creepy.

I, I'm sorry, I have to get you something better.

No, it's great, I love it.

It's funny an-and quirky and, and so sweet.

It's like you.

That's why I love it.

I love it.

Thank you, I love it.

I... I love you.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

You're welcome.

Look at you, all dressed up.

What, are you in The Temptations tonight?

That's so cute, Nick, you're intimidated by my style.

But I'll tell you what...

one of us is walking out of here with a job.

Where you going?

You wore my present.

I did.

Thank you, I love it. Yay.

She's seen it now, so maybe you can take it off.

You look like a man.

I know, right? That's what's freaking me out.

Good humor and fun... God forbid.

Is that Schmidt?

Oh.

What the...?

Hey, guys.

Whoa, whoa, Schmidt, Santa voice.

This isn't temple.

Ho, ho, ho.

Are those my shorts?

Hey, what's wrong, Jess?

Hey, Nick.

Paul told me he loved me.

Hmm. And I couldn't say it back, so I, um, said "Thank you,"

which was horrible.

I don't know what to do because I am always the one who loves more.

That's my thing.

One time I went on a date and by 11:00 p.m., I gave the guy my ATM code.

What is your ATM code?

42...

Very funny.

Very good try, but no.

Not a try... I got it.

If you don't have feelings for Paul, you got to tell him.

I can't do that to someone on Christmas.

And then it's New Year's.

Then it's going to be Valentine's Day and then, whoa, it's Presidents' Day.

Hard to argue with that logic, but just tell him.

Don't lead him on... you'll just hurt him more.

Okay.

I'm gonna do it.

I'm gonna tell him.

You are?

Yeah.

Hey, what are you doing in here?

Kyle's being a jerk.

What are you doing in here?

Eating cookies and avoiding confrontation.

Remember when Christmas used to be fun and all I had to do was worry about my drunk uncle asking me out?

Yes, Uncle Pardeep.

He thought I was a boy.

Such a weirdo.

Okay.

Hey, man.

Hey.

How you doing, Paul?

Good.

Has Jess not talked to you?

Oh, yeah, no, we talked.

Yeah, yeah, no, I...

She did, okay.

Yeah, it's hard, you know, it's really tricky. It's like she doesn't love you right now, Paul, but that's not to say she might not fall in love with you later.

I think that's the positive way of looking at it, but it's hard, man, believe me.

We talked about how we might have to drive you to the airport 'cause you're gonna miss your flight.

Yeah, that was probably all you guys talked about, so I'm joking.

W-Wait a minute. Because she hasn't...

Yeah, I know... guess what, Paul.

Don't even think right now.

I'm drunk.

Did... Jess tell you... I'm so drunk.

that she doesn't love me? What's happ...? No, shut up, you goofball.

I'm... this conversation didn't happen.

Did Jess tell you she doesn't love me?

Joke.

But he's the best guy, Cece.

Maybe I should just make it work.

Yeah, no, Jess, you can't just dive into something like this right now.

Yeah, I just wish I could stay in this bathroom all night.

Me, too.

Whoo, that eggnog is deadly.

We got to get out of here.

Yeah, we do.

I should just put it off till later, after the holidays.

You coming?

Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.

Kyle wants to go to this party.

Ugh, Kyle is the living worst.

Yeah, I know.

Did he even get you a gift?

No.

Who wants to sit at a desk all day?

Not me... I don't want to have to do that.

I don't want to call Wednesday "hump day."

I don't even know how to network.

So what's your deal, man?

Why are you sitting here by yourself?

Mommy won't let me sit in Santa's lap.

You have a smart mommy.

Yeah.

Hi, I'm the genius who brought my kid to this Christmas party.

Looking forward to years of therapy over Dirty Santa.

I can't believe that he's even talking to you.

He doesn't like anyone.

Yeah, I don't like anyone.

Yeah, but we're really working on that.

No, she's working on that.

My man.

Okay? You think it's fun?

Do it. I do think it's fun.

Do it then.

Do it.

Okay.

What are you doing, Santa?

I have a really bad case of Santa lap.

The entire marketing department is wearing wool.

It's not good down there.

Well, get back to work soon.

Boom! Ow! Why would you...?

There are so many bobby pins up there.

Everything's attached... Does she always talk to you like that?

Yeah, kind of.

You like dressing up like Santa?

Sexy Santa.

No. The truth is, no, I don't.

You know, you don't deserve to be treated like that.

You just got to tell her no.

Otherwise, all she'll do is see you as a pretty face and a hot body.

I'm sorry, what was that?

You have a pretty face.

No, no, no, 'cause the second part.

And I'd like you to say it, like, in an accent, but make direct eye contact. Yes, Schmidt, do not push your luck with me.

What's that smell?

That's your perfume.

You wore it?

Yeah, and it smells terrible.

Ha!

It does smell terrible.

It's like a dirty dish towel.

Santa voice!

Please just tell me what she said.

She said the sex is really great, but she just doesn't want to jump into anything.

Why am I talking about this? Oh, my God, the sex is great, it's amazing.

Great. We had amazing sex this morning, and then we ate Taro chips.

Oh, my God. Oh, oh. Oh, God. I... I feel like such a terrible guy for saying that to you, man.

Oh, my God. You're a good guy, Genzlinger.

Hey, man, just let it go.

You know what I mean? Just let it brush off your shoulders, dude. Oh, man.

What has happened to my life? Hey.

Why are you guys hugging?

Just guy-talkin'. Yeah.

Yeah? Everything's fine.

We're just talking. Just talking.

About, uh... how moved we are... by jazz music.

That's a lie.

I told him you didn't love him, Jess.

What?! Because I...

But he said it nicely.

Are you kidding me?!

It's not your information to share. I totally agree, and I regret it. It is not your information...

Why would you do that?

I apologize.


You guys have a lot to do. I'm sorry. Nick. Nick.

Oh, my God.

Please! This is my nightmare!

Winston!

Schmidt!

Help me...!

Paul, I really care about you.

I think I just... I think I just feel really overwhelmed.

Yeah. Yeah, I know, Nicholas told m...

Damn it.

Hey, guys, just pretend I'm not here, and just do whatever you two guys are doing.

I'm not here. I'm not even listening.

This is my nightmare.

I-I knew you were getting out of a long relationship.

You told me all about Spencer. I just thought...

I thought we were feeling the same things for each other.

You seemed like you were.

I was. I just...

I feel like maybe you were feeling them a little bit more than me.

Nick!

You started this.

Sit down and be quiet!

I just... I got really hurt, and I... I'm trying really hard not to get hurt again.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Oh.

Oh...

I am so sorry.

This is as rude as it gets.

It is my mom, though.

I... Hey, Ma. How you doing?

I can't talk right now.

I'm in a real weird situation.

No, Ma, I'm not high... I'm done with that phase.

I promise you I won't miss my flight.

Okay. I love you, Mama. Bye.

You done?

Can we just...

can we just keep going but take it a little bit slow?

I-I don't know if I can do that.

I don't know how with you.

It's just not how I feel. Well, all she's asking you to do is slow it down a little bit.

How's that hard?

Nick.

Yeah.

All right, everybody leave the room.

I need to talk to Kim.

Okay, you know what? Actually, stay... this'll be good for you guys to hear this, too.

Why d... Don't...

Come on.

I just told... There are two hours left in this party.

What are you doing, Santa?

Kim, I'm not gonna be Sexy Santa anymore.

It's over. Santa's d*ad.

I k*lled him.

Oh, my God.

No, no, no, don't worry, that's just Gina's cowardly son.

He is a scream machine.

Kim, I'm not a sex object, all right?

I'm your employee.

And I work harder than anyone.

I'm the first one to show up every morning.

No, you're not.

There's never a parking space.

That's because everyone's already here, Nick.

Okay, you're so off topic right now.

You're missing the point. What?

You need to take me seriously, Kim.

Does that mean no more...

Sexy Easter Bunny?

No Sexy Easter Bunny.

What about, uh, Cinco de Sexy?

No Cinco de Sexy.

And no Sexy Martin Luther King?

I could never get the voice, I never really felt like I had the authority...

I can't believe it took you five years to say that.

Well, I guess I'm gonna have to be Sexy Santa next year.

Yeah, just got to jingle bell rock.

You know what I mean?

That is so inappropriate.

I get it... so you can dish it out but you can't take it.

Yeah, how's that feel, Kim?

I like it.

Both these machines need toner.

They need... I'm gonna put the toner in the...

in the machine.

Mrs. Miller, I told you, I will get Nick to his flight on time.

No worries.

I can't find Elvin. I've looked everywhere.

I-I have no idea. Uh, you know what?

I got to go. Um, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.

We'll find him.

Elvin!

I'll tell you what, you go that way, I'll go that way.

This is Schmidt's fault. I don't know how, but it is.

Elvin?

I'm sorry, Jess, I just...

I don't want to slow down... with you.

It's just not natural. So if you need to, then... I don't think I can do this anymore.

Okay.

Come on, Paul!

It's Christmas!

Don't break up with her... Hey, Nick...

It's okay.

Hey, have you guys seen a little kid running around here?

Thank you.

Ah. I see you found Santa's house.

I was looking for it.

The man with no shirt k*lled Santa.

Oh, you mean Schmidt.

Well, he was just dressing up like Santa.

Then why didn't he have a shirt?

You know, we ask ourselves that question every single day.

Is it because he's a D-bag? Mommy says he's a D-bag.

You know something?

You're a really smart kid.

And for that, Santa's gonna bring you extra presents this year.

Really?

Yeah.

Thank you, LeBron.

Okay, cool, I'll be him.

You found him!

Yeah. Hi!

Extra gifts this year.

You're really good at this. Seriously.

If you ever want to hang out with Elvin again...

I will pay you a lot of money.

Let's go.

A lot.

Thank you.

Like, whatever you're thinking, add money to that...

'cause that's what I...

Like, a lot.

Bye, Elvin.

Bye, LeBron.

Yep.

What up, Mrs. Miller?

Yes, yes. Actually, we're on our way right now, so just go back to sleep.

We're getting Nick to the airport, okay?

What kind of airline has flights that

Actually, what's that smell?

It's nothing. Oh. That's my perfume.

Oh, God, that is bad.

But the weird kind of bad that makes you want to smell it again.

Okay, there's something that we got to do. Sorry.

What are you doing, man!

Hold on, you're going in the wrong direction!

I think we're too late, Nick.

Yeah, this was supposed to be your gift, Jess.

I screwed it up.

I'm sorry.

Candy Cane Lane is shut down!

Should've got her perfume, man.

Nice, man.

Man.

Yeah.

I have the worst timing.

I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Let's go.

We should go. No, we don't...

Jess, no.

It's Christmas. It's our Christmas.

We came here to see the lights.

Well, what are we gonna do?

Yeah, what are you doing? What are you doing?

It's 2:00 a.m. Why would they turn them off?

It doesn't make sense to me. Nick!

We don't got time for this.

Excuse me, guys?

Oh, hell, no!

Excuse me, we got a girl out here who'd really like to see the lights!

Sorry to wake you! This is rude!

Make it the Candy Cane Lane or whatever!

You spend all this time to show off and do it, so show off... you got an audience!

This whole neighborhood is ridiculous!

You all show off, so turn on the lights!

Just go in the shed or whatever and turn your damn lights on, you show-offs!

Turn on your lights! Turn on the lights!

Turn on your lights!

Lights! Turn on your lights!

Turn on your lights! Turn on your lights!

Turn on your lights!

Yes! Yes!

Merry Christmas, everyone!

Merry Hanukkah!

Now, stop yelling before I call the cops!

Oh, my God.

Candy Cane Lane is the crÃ¨me de la crme It is... amazing. of decorated streets.

Hey, Ma! How are you?

Yeah. No, I'm gonna miss my flight.

Yeah, I'm sorry. No.

Ma, stop yelling at me, please stop yelling.

Ma, I'm not high! Stop yelling!

I'm driving a car. I can't talk.

Hey, remember Winston?

Winston, it's my ma. Talk to her.

Hey, what up, Mrs. Miller?

You know, I wrote a poem about you.

You want to hear it?

Wait, wait.

Are we really gonna do this?

Yes. Yes!

Okay.

âª Intercourse, intercourse. âª

Intercourse.

(chants):

Intercourse.

(makes crowd noises)

Sorry, that was weird.

(chuckles)

No, no, no. It's okay.

I have to go to the loo.

Okay.

Hey, tiger.

You're having sex tonight.

Don't give me that look, just do it.

I'm sorry.

No. You kidding?

Don't worry about it.

It's fine.

I just haven't had sex with anyone but Spencer in six years, and I get so nervous.

It's like starting a new job with a really weird interview.

Don't worry about it. I'm good.

I'm more than good.

It's okay.

You know what?

Tomorrow night.

Let's just go out to dinner and then just nail each other.

Just pound each other.

V-b*mb on the P-b*mb.

(makes expl*si*n noise)

I would have the... P-b*mb, right?

âª Who's that girl? Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª It's Jess. âª

Yes, I'm confirming the appointment.

I made the damn appointment.

That's what. Why wouldn't...

Yeah, okay.

Appointment confirmed.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Yeah, there's not a chance I'm going.

Can you not do this to yourself?

Look at your hair, you look ridiculous.

What am I supposed to talk about for an hour?

It's a haircut.

No, you're trapped.

You can't move, and they're standing behind you with their hands in your hair, and they expect you to talk back.

Oh, yeah, it's your baby.

He's cute.

Yeah, your baby's cute.

Okay, I tell you what, man, just come to my place.

No, I'm not going to a black barbershop, Winston.

I've seen the movies;

I know how fast they talk.

I don't need to seem any less cool than I already do.

Want to go to my salon?

Hey, guys.

Hey.

So, um...

heads up, Paul's coming tonight.

And I just wanted to tell you that I'm gonna tap him like a maple tree.

I'm gonna be searching for some syrups.

I'm gonna be having sex with him.

All right.

All right, hey!

Why are you telling us this?

'Cause I want to. I want to give you a heads up.

You nervous? You need tips?

No, I'm not nervous.

Just, you know, I can drive stick.

(chuckles)

Yeah, 'cause it seems like you're freaking out a little bit.

With this whole activity.

That's not stick, that's a*t*matic.

That's not a*t*matic.

Another bathroom break, Schmidt?

You know, I've been timing you all day.

Seven minutes and 23 seconds.

I wonder what was going on in there.

Hmm? You pooped.

Can you stop timing me, please?

It's ridiculous that you do that.

I will break you.

Hey, Lisa!

You were on f*re last night, girl!

I'm taking her job.

What did you do last night?

Everyone from the office went to Jill's bachelorette party.

Why don't I get invited places?

Is it because I'm the only man in the office?

"Man." That's adorable.

How is it...

You know, Sarah got promoted.

Sarah?

With the, with the gums?

Yeah.

So she's out of the...

That corner cubicle is free.

(sighs)

So much kick-back space.

And, you know, Gina personally invited me to her baby shower tonight.

So that corner cubicle ... that's all mine.

You like a Bond villain?

You just told me your whole plan.

(chuckles)

(British accent): Mr. Darcy's going to love my new bonnet.

Why are we here?

You don't understand.

You've never been cheated on before.

Spencer and I never tried anything new, and maybe if I'd been... more erotic...

Spencer cheated on you because he's a total jerk, not 'cause you're bad in bed.

It's been six years.

Everything I know about sex, I learned from Spencer or the Clinton impeachment trial.

MAN:

He used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the Oval Office area...

WOMAN: Jess!

Mom?!

I'm not listening to NPR.

(whistles)

No. No whistle.

It's terrible!

Uh, excusez-moi.

Can I try this on, please?

Oh, the starfish. You can't try that on.

Health code.

I'll take it!

Ha!

I hope Paul's packing some coral polyps,

'cause this starfish is hungry.

(chuckles)

Starfish eat coral polyps.

Just pay, Jess.

So today I'm gonna show you how to cut your own hair.

Uh, I consider myself...

Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing, Nick?

It's a haircut! Human interaction.

You're a bartender, you talk to strangers every single day.

I don't like when they touch my head, Winston.

I don't like it.

Go to the damn salon!

No, it's fine, okay?

I'm learning how to do it myself.

I'm learning from this video.

(screaming)

Oh!

Oh, my God, man!

(screaming)

I was wondering why it had so many views.

Let's watch it again.

Hey.

(chuckles) What?

You know, Gina, I was just walking by and, I mean, I was literally pulled in here by the glow.

What do you want, Schmidt?

I was just working my tail off at my cubicle, which, between you and me, is surrounded by a couple of chatty Cathys.

I mean, that's really their names.

It's Cathy S. and Cathy G.

Anyway, they won't shut up about a baby shower tonight for a certain VP VP.

"Very pregnant vice presidente."

You're the worst. Seriously, the worst.

Get out.

Gina, honestly, it would mean so much to me if you would just let me come to your baby shower.

Okay, fine. Come to my baby shower.

I can come? - Yeah.

So I'm invited?

Yeah, you're invited.

All right.

I saw your registry.

I'm gonna get you one of those portable baby pumps.

You're just out there in every day life, but you're pumping yourself at the same time, you know.

Just milking away. Just...

(makes sh**ting noises)

Get out.

Okay, I'm gonna go.

Why don't we meet here at 8:00?

PAUL:

Great. Okay.

Uh, where's the place?

Um, I think it's in Koreatown.

Let me check.

Ooh, exotic.

(sighs)

Let me see here.

(woman shrieks, whip cracks over computer)

(man moans)

PAUL:

Jess?

What?

Oh, um...

Sorry, uh...

Can I call you back?

Yeah.

(man and woman moaning, speaking Spanish)

(key clicks, video stops)

Hey, Schmidt!

Can I borrow your computer?

Nick? Winston?

(key clicks, video resumes)

(man and woman moaning, speaking Spanish)

(whip cracks)

(chuckles)

What?

(mechanical buzzing)

(woman shrieks, man chuckles)

What?

(man laughs, whip cracks)

Hey, do you have my comput...

Oh, my computer.

I have your computer.

I can see that.

Hey, I got to cram for this baby shower.

Can I, can I have it back?

I've been watching p*rn.

You...

(chuckles)

I found your red folder.

How-how long you been doing that for? Are you okay?

Five and a half hours.

(horse neighs)

Wow. Uh, you went deep, Jess.

Real deep.

Help me, guys.

I have 15 minutes.

Teach me how to be good at sex.

I just, I have to go on this date right now and I can't do it. I'm freaking out, okay?

I need all of you to sit in front of me and tell me what guys like in bed, right now.

What do you want to know?

Okay.

Um, when you're...

if you're in the...

if you're holding the...

Start over.

Um...

when you reach...completion...

Yeah, that was it.

Completion?

No! No, wait.

I can't do this, Jess.

Come on. Come back here.

Jess, guys want to be whisked away.

They want to be enchanted.

Just take your clothes off, Jess.

Do you think that Paul watches stuff like that?

All the time.

For sure.

Probably watching it right now.

Really? Okay.

I put this on mute, because this girl's...

like, pretty loud.

And, um, my main thing that I took away was, gosh, that young lady can really multitask.

Super normal.

She's a pro.

What she's doing.

I don't know if every girl's like that, but she's a pro.

Was wondering if there are any trendy moves.

'Cause I've been doing the same four for the last six years, like...

Uh, and you know, like, uh...

(groans)

That one.

And I don't know.

Do you think that Paul would be into, like, something like that?

What, a little light choking?

I'm gonna bet Paul is into some pretty dark stuff.

Light choking, really?

No one's doing that.

You know what, Nick, maybe you're hooking up with the wrong kind of girl.

Apparently, I'm hooking up with the right girl, Schmidt, because they don't choke me.

Nick is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.

Winston and I...

Don't want to be a part of this.

...we're sushi.

So you guys really think you're better at sex than me.

Yeah.

Absolutely.

What did you do after you lost your virginity? What did you say to me?

Don't say that right now. You're taking it out of context.

He said, "Winston, is it okay that I didn't get my pants all the way off?"

That's a true story. That really happened.

I was 16 years old.

And I've gotten a lot better.

You haven't gotten that much better. I used to listen to you and Caroline all the time in college.

It was like listening to a rescue crew trying to communicate with a stranded miner.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah. Are you okay?"

"Yeah."

Hey, guys, I don't have much time.

Can we get this back on track?

I need to know what to do.

Would flicking be, like, a cool thing?

No.

No!

Absolutely not.

How about role play?

Do you know any voices?

Yes. I can do an old-timey newscaster, like, "Hey there, son, I'm gonna kick you into next Tuesday, see?"


You're telling me, for the last 15 years, you've been thinking I'm bad at sex. I'm fantastic at sex.

Dude, you're scared to get a haircut.

Yeah, I don't like getting a haircut!

It's too intimate. What does that have to do with sex?

Okay, Jess, here's what you're gonna do.

You got a question, just come to me because I'm obviously the best.

No, you're not the best.

Jess, who do you think, of the three of us, is the best at sex?

Yes.

And take emotion out of it.

No one's feelings are gonna get hurt.

Go with your gut. - Especially, you know, Nick and Winston's.

No, I'm not doing this.

Say a name.

Go with your gut.

(knock on door)

Oh. Oh!

Hey! Paul!

Hey, Paul.

Hey.

PAUL: Hey.

Hey, goose.

Hey, goose.

(chuckles)

JESS: I'm gonna go get ready in my room.

Okay.

I'll be back.

I'll just hang out with the guys.

Cool.

Hey, guys.

What's up?

What's up?

What's up, Paul?

Oh, you're looking at me like, "what?"

I should tell you.

Um, "Goose" is short for

"me gusta Jess."

Of course.

Come here, sit down, man.

Thank you. - I am so tired of people being so careful with me.

It's like, I am 40

and I am pregnant.

I am not made out of crackers.

(laughing) (laughs)

Hey, ladies What are you guys talking about?

Afterbirth.

Afterbirth.

That's like the, the party you guys have after you have the baby...

Sort of. - You know, I'd like to be invited to that.

You know what they say,

"An afterbirth ain't an afterbirth without some Schmidt up I in there."

Schmidt? Come here.

I'm gonna talk to you in a little bit.

What are you doing?

I'm rocking this party, Beth.

Watch this.

Hi. How's everyboby doing?

You know, I just, I just wanted to take a moment to, well, to say how honored I am to celebrate the journey of Bogart through Gina, and out and into the light.

Here's to elective C-sections!

(women cheering)

Just face it, baby.

You don't know the first thing about women.

Ah, you're the best, Beth. I don't know if you know this about me, but I was in two frats in college.

Want to know why?

'Cause I just couldn't decide.

Hey, ladies! Let's get this party started!

(cheering)

âª âª

We're all getting drunk tonight! Except for you, Gina.

Horribly irresponsible.

(classical piano plays)

So, I'm looking forward to having sex tonight.

Yeah. Me, too.

Sex is the b*mb.

(chuckles)

Sorry. That sounded like a guy from Entourage.

Do you like p*rn?

No. Do you?

Yeah, I mean, I... Yeah.

I do, I do like p*rn.

Yeah, you know, when my imagination isn't really working...

or I've exhausted, uh, the bullpen.

I just find it very erotic.

And then I just love, like...

everything that's erotic.

âª âª

SCHMIDT:

Yeah, party!

Party, yeah!

Yeah, Gina! Yeah!

Baby wants his bottle! Yeah!

SCHMIDT (laughing):

Party!

(cheering, laughing)

WOMEN (chanting):

Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

(cheering)

Ah-ha! Yeah!

This is so weird!

(laughing)

I love it!

(yells)

(Schmidt laughing, women gasp)

I'm having a baby!

(wild cheering)

She's having a baby!

Yeah!

...the things people say sometimes, I don't really...

write it, but I think...

Are we going to do this?

Yeah. Definitely.

Sit down.

Okay.

Whoa, wow.

(imitates old-timey newscaster):

You are hot, hot, hot.

Thank you. Hello, weather service? Oh!

There's a heat wave from Portsmouth to Port, Kansas!

I don't know, I don't... what is happening.

We're talking dirty, slim.

Oh, okay. You want me to do... you're doing a voice.

You want me to do a voice? Okay, um...

Well, I'm so happy to be here!

Jimmy Stewart?

(as Jimmy Stewart):

You look ravishing in your...

netting...

Thank you very much.

...contraption.

Now, why don't you let me see your little caboose?

Okay, here. Let me go ahead and...

Your caboose.

Oh, okay.

Your butt.

Oh, my butt! Okay.

Here's my caboose!

Oh, happy birthday, me!

I... Oh.

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

I'm so sorry. Is that okay?

No, it was great.

(as Jimmy Stewart): I just it felt so good, and sensual.

Hey!

You want me to wiggle it around?

How about you help me get a little more comfortable?

Oh. Oh, all right, dear.

Okay, I just don't know...

I'm going to try something different.

Oh. Okay, great.

(imitates old woman):

Young man!

Young man, the things I'm gonna do to you!

Well, I can't wait to...

Young man, don't take all day.

Well, I-I understand, ma'am, but you're wearing chain mail here.

I am not getting any younger.

It's like an erotic rope course.

Okay, I... let me try up here.

I think it's... I can't do the voice and get this off at the same time...

Okay.

Oh. Is that, are you okay?

Yes.

Wow, this is a...

(deep voice):

I'm gonna split you like a log!

(yelling)

Okay. What are you... wait, hold on. What is that?

It's a lumberjack.

Hold on one second.

Can we just... start over, and just kind of go back to basics for a minute?

Just you and me.

Okay.

Okay.

Just our regular voices.

(laughs)

All right.

See? So nice.

(choking):

So nice...

(Paul choking)

Ah, you're hurting me.

Oh, my God!

(gasping)

Oh, God.

Are you okay?

Oh, yeah, I'm good, I'm good!

(gasping)

Let me get you some water.

Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna get some water at home.

I-I have good water at home.

No, no, no, I have water here.

I have a filter, it's a special ionized filter...

I got at home.

Oh, I'm so glad you convinced me to go to your barbershop.

Wow, man. I... it actually looks really good.

Right? I look good.

And I loved it in there. You think they liked me in there?

I think they loved you in there, man.

NICK:

Okay, good.

How'd it go?

Is he still in there, Jess?

No more tea.

I forgot to buy tea.

(softly):

Hello.

Where's...

where's the door?

Hey.

What's up, Jess?

You okay, Jess?

I messed up.

He ran away. He got scared.

Why would he be scared?

Because I choked him.

I lightly choked him.

Wow.

That's what happens when you listen to Schmidt.

It's just... when I was with Spencer, I just didn't even think about this stuff, you know?

Just did it.

Okay.

Here's the thing.

You gotta stop thinking about it.

Just relax, and be yourself.

You're awesome.

What do you think, Winston?

Why are you asking Winston?

Because, Nick, look at your hair.

You really don't look like someone who's good at sex.

I can't believe you just said that.

Here's what you do. You're gonna stop worrying about it.

Completely.

Yeah. That's really good.

That's literally what I just said.

What are you worried about, anyway?

Paul doesn't care what you do.

I've seen the way that boy looks at you.

And he is crazy about you.

I agree, I...

Shh.

I'm trying to listen to Winston.

(knocking on door)

Oh, hi!

Hi.

Paul.

Hey, Winston.

Could I talk to you for a minute?

Yeah.

We'll... step into my office.

Okay. Hey, Nick.

NICK: Okay.

Um...

Hi.

Hi.

So, last night was, um...

No, I'm so sorry.

No, no, don't, please...

Unacceptable.

I'm really intimidated by you, Jess.

You're so experienced, and I've never done any of that stuff, that S and M style... bondage stuff.

It scares me a little, but I...

want to do it, because I know that you're into it.

Just please be gentle with me at first, okay?

I really like you.

Really?

Yeah, I do.

And nothing else matters.

(sighs)

Except, just...

no f*re, and no handcuffs, please. Please, please, please.

Okay? And I'm allergic to felt.

And most polyurethanes.

Okay, well, that's it.

And no bugs, too, I don't know if that was...

(elevator bell dings) Paul.

Wait. Um...

Last night was kind of a... low point for me. I mean...

I'm not really into that stuff. I just... I thought that whatever I used to do wouldn't be good enough, or sexy enough, or advanced enough, and that's why I did that...

Oh no!

Sorry. - Oh, no. No, it's okay, it just surprised me a little bit.

I just...

I like you.

Well, good.

I'll walk you down.

Okay.

Oh! Um, the new trombones came in...

Paul...

(gasping, kissing)

(emergency stop alarm buzzes)

You know that doesn't speed it up when you do that.

I know, I know.

(elevator bell dings)

We're about to go see a movie.

You guys want to come?

Sure.

Sure.

Hey, Jess? Is that your shoe?

Boy, your haircut look like a high-rise.

(laughing)

Where the penthouse at?

Hey, old man, what, did you steal those pants off of Danny Glover's grandfather?

(Nick laughing)

I am Danny Glover's grandfather.

I'm a big fan of his work.

He's great in the Lethal w*apon.

No, I'm not.

(laughing)

Mmm. You know you want in on this, man.

A little fatty toon... little yellow T...

Cali roll.

Samurai snack.

So scrummy.

I'm good with this. Looks like you're soloing on $80 worth of sushi, Schmidt.

'Cause I got the means, player. Look, I get why you don't want to get down there.

But, Winston, you got to climb aboard, man.

You got a serious J-O-B now.

Serious?

Yeah.

Dude, it's a temp job.

If by "serious,"

you mean "piece of crap,"

then yeah, it's serious.

I'm surprised you haven't made a game of it.

Oh, I've tried.

(click)

I'm losing my mind, guys.

You know, I sometimes touch the frayed part of the power cord just to feel something.

What's up, guys?

Nobody has any lady guests coming over tonight, right?

Lady guests?

And how do you feel about opening your home and your hearts to the youth of America?

(indistinct chatter)

Yo, Miss Day, where should we set up these bells?

(bells crashing)

âª Hey, girl âª
âª What you doing? âª
âª Hey, girl âª
âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com JESS:

I'm so sorry, you guys, I should have told you, but the community center decided to turn our rehearsal space back into a hallway, so...

I had nowhere to go.

Is this something that a mean, creative judge made you do?

NICK: Yeah, this is just like a nightmare I had where you brought over teenagers with bells.

JESS:

These kids had a choice between early morning detention and music, and they all chose music.

No kidding?

Desiree, bells are not for hitting.

The kids wanted to play band instruments, but we got a huge donation of handbells, which are tres tres dope.

DESIREE: Miss Day, can I eat some of these crackers up in here?

(chuckles):

No, no, no. Water crackers are for adults... to eat with adult cheese.

Can I eat a cr*cker sushi sandwich?

No. Jess.

WINSTON: So what, you guys are gonna sit around all night playing "Jingle Bells"?

"Jingle Bells" is a trash song played on a trash instrument, and I'm not really asking permission, I'm giving you a heads-up.

(laughs):

Well, that got serious.

Anyway, you are gonna love these kids.

(playing very out-of-tune

"Camptown Races")

Thank you, Schmidt.

Wonderful.

(continue playing badly)

Great, guys!

So good.

Just think, you could be in detention right now.

Is it too late to choose detention?

We suck.

We don't suck, we just need a little bit of rehearsal.

Hector, okay, good!

Big finish, and... we're out.

I'm so proud of you.

That's what it feels like to play a song sort of together.

Bring it in.

In.

Yes.

Ensembell!

Ensembell!

Five minutes

(toilet flushing)

of text time ... you earned it.

DESIREE (calls):

Oh, dear... Miss Day!

Desiree?

Miss Day!

Oh!

You got a twisted toilet, Miss Day.

Nick!

Toilet situation! Code one! Water only!

You didn't tell her the system?

Oh, I'm sorry, she went rogue.

You have to turn on the faucet before you flush the toilet, 'cause...

(sighs)

All right.

Thank you, Nick.

All right.

There we go, no problem.

Perfect. You did it.

The plastic soda bottle is right where it's supposed to be ...

Back in the wall hole.

What? It's fixed.

I've heard that before.

âª âª

It's fixed.

(squeaking)

It's fixed.

(drill whirrs)

It's fixed.

Okay, Nick, repeat after me:

I am not the Chinese kid from Goonies.

You know, I fix things just to the point of working, Schmidt.

If you want a fancy-fix, just say so.

Okay.

Please fancy-fix the toilet.

That's all you had to say.

(bells playing lively melody)

That actually sounds really good.

(lively melody continues)

(lively melody continues)

(music pauses)

(chuckles)

JESS:

Whoa.

You're amazing!

âª âª

(shudders)

Goose pimples.

Look. Each one...

a memory.

JESS:

Winston, please help me.

Just hear me out.

Two things women love ...

Alternative percussion players and role models.

The kids would love it and we'd get to spend time together.

You got to do it ... it's a Mitzvah, bro.

Are you sure you've never rung before?

Believe it or not, Jess, I have never played handbells before.

I just pick things up easy, that's all.

I know handbells aren't the coolest instrument in the world, they might not even be the fifth coolest, but the kids would love it, it would really mean a lot to them, and if they saw how good you are, I think they'd really get into it and maybe try a little bit harder.

Also, there's, like, a lot of potentially cool, like, bell shorthand we could use to talk about...

(whispers):

Nick...

while he's right there we'll be, like...

"Nick's such a tinkle!"

"I think he's more like a tonkel."

Tinkle and tonkel are potential bell talk we could use.

I get it.

Just be cool, please.

I am cool.

Before you make your decision, I'd only need you till the concert on Sunday.

(bell dings)

I don't know, I think I could be into this.

Yay!

And with that statement, he never had sex again.

âª Winston and me are playing bells every day... âª

Until Sunday. I'm cool.

Nick, look, I don't mean to nag you, but how long is this gonna take?

Fancy-fix, fancy amount of time.

'Cause I would like to use my own bathroom now.

Sir, bathrooms are for customers only.

Mm.

How dare you.

If only there were some sort of pipe and...

and water expert that we could hire to come and fix this problem.

Yeah, I can't afford a plumber.

A plumber! That's what it's called!

You really want to do this?

You want to have this fight with me?

You want to go down this path, Schmidt?

I don't know, is this a path that you recently fixed?

It's called self-reliance.

'Cause unlike you, Schmidt, I don't just throw my money at problems.

All I'm hearing is that I can't use my bathroom because you're poor.

Look, it's your lucky day, buddy.

I'm gonna pay for the plumber.

No, Schmidt, I don't want your charity.

Well, you seem very happy using my emergency tools.

Oh, yeah? Do you even know what this is?

Doy, it's a scissor.

Yeah, that's exactly right.

A scissor. Really, Schmidt?

Yeah, a scissors that you just threw in the turdlet.

So, tonight at rehearsal, keep an eye out for Hector.

I'm having trouble getting him to interact.

He really wants to play the drums, so I told him bells were the next best thing, which was a lie, so I couldn't keep a straight face while I was saying it.

He saw right through me.

(laughs)

So, why do you do this bell thing, Jess?

I mean, like, how do you win?

(laughs)

You don't win.

You win by helping the kids.

I just want to get them to care and try hard, you know?

So you want them to try hard?

Yeah.

I'll get them to try hard.

No, I'm telling you, they're not gonna listen to you.

Okay.

Oh, what, a plumber?

You plan it this way?

Just to rub my face in it?

Yes, I wanted to rub your face in our working toilet.

Great. Well, that working toilet I will never use.

You're never gonna go to the bathroom again?

Oh, you're the soda bottle guy.

Yeah.

That was actually pretty smart.

Thank you! Thank you.

And I have nothing to say to you.

Okay.

Question for you, sir. How much did he pay for this?

All right, you know what? That's enough.

$50? $100?

Inappropriate.

Hey, my name's Schmidt. I was born rich.

I had a $40,000 Bar Mitzvah.

Okay.

How long you do the petty act for, man, huh?

A week? A month?

Is this "my favorite bedspread"

all over again?

That was a handmade gift my nanny gave me that you spilled a pitcher of Midori Sours on, and now you bring it up like it's nothing?

I left you a check for $30 on your pillow.

Your nanny gave you that thing for free, so as far as I'm concerned, you're up 30 bucks.

My nanny is d*ad!

I'm not looking to make money off of her!

I will not apologize again for the Midori Sours!

Who drinks Midori Sours?!

Everyone drinks Midori Sours!

No, they don't!

It's a melon liqueur!

I would never drink one!

It's an American classic with Asian influences!

Winston would never drink one!

Enjoy the couch. I bought that, too.

Enjoy the rug, too ... paid for that.

Organic woven.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Oh, come on, man.

Well, I stole the cable!

And my Bar Mitzvah was an amazing event!

(door slams)


The theme was sports jams.

(bells playing

"Camptown Races" badly)

(virtuosic playing)

(last note rings)

OTHERS: Oh! Wow! Oh, my God! That was really good.

That was amazing.

Wow!

That was off the hammer!

(chuckles)

The hammer in the bell.

(Jess laughs)

âª Tough crowd. âª

WINSTON: Here's what I was thinking, okay?

If we want to win this concert, we play something cool, like "Eye of the Tiger."

GIRL:

What's "Eye of the Tiger"?

"Eye of the Tiger" is the greatest song ever written.

It's so cool, it ended the Cold w*r.

That's not even a little bit true.

I never thought bells could be cool.

What do you mean?

I make bells cool.

Do that thing where you hold three bells in one hand...

Three-in-hand.

I think she's talking about the Winston.

OTHERS: Yeah. The Winston.

It's actually called the three-in-hand.

I can do it.

Yeah, but can you do this?

(Winston playing beautiful chords)

(music stops)

Oh, my God!

That was really pretty.

(exotic accent):

But Miss Day has a few tricks up her sleeves as well.

Let's see what you got.

Yeah, come on, Miss Day.

Let's see what you got, Miss Day.

(playing dissonant chords)

âª âª

(deep, monotone voice):

âª I am a robot âª
âª Trying to play the bells âª
âª Don't judge me,

'cause I can't âª
âª Think at all, I just âª
âª Like to play the bells. âª

I want to play

"Eye of the Tiger."

Yeah, come on, "Tiger"!

Yeah, please!

I don't know, I don't know.

That sounds so fun, but we can't, because we don't have time.

Oh, darn!

Here's what I was thinking.

If you skip school and practice, then, boom, you got it.

Mr. Bishop.

Yeah, yeah.

Done.

(kids chattering)

What's the deal with Winston?

He's really intense.

Oh, look, I grew up with Winston.

I know how he is.

He's incredibly talented, but he's a jerk about it.

Yeah, he's one of those guys that he'll never pass the ball if he thinks he can score.

JESS: I just don't know why it needs to be a competition.

That's just the way some guys are, Jess, you know?

They get themselves wrapped up in these insecure, silly games.

Hey, Nick, uh, we're good with that whole plumber thing, right?

Absolutely.

Yeah, okay, cool, 'cause...

'cause I was right about that whole thing.

Oh!

Yeah, I unfixed that.

Well, how you gonna unfix a d*ad Schmidt?!

I'm not worried about it!

(men shouting)

You're so predictable, Schmidt!

âª Stop yelling âª
âª I don't want to hear you yelling anymore. âª

(sighs)

What...?

I paid for the freezer, so, you know.

I'm gonna k*ll you.

(humming "Eye of the Tiger")

That's a, that's a B right there.

Get that in there.

(humming "Eye of the Tiger")

You're fired.

Focus.

Are you focused?

Okay, what's the song about?

Hector?

Hanging tough. Staying hungry.

A man and his will to survive.

Are you brown-nosing me?

Yes, I am.

You're so cool.

Where are your eyes?

KIDS:

On the tiger.

One, two, three, four.

(playing "Eye of the Tiger")

Two, three, four.

(playing discordantly)

No! No, no, no, no!

Are you kidding me?

It is not that hard, people.

It is an instrument that a cat wears around its neck.

Okay, you know what, I think they did a pretty great job, considering the fact that they've only played it, like, eight times.

Well you're wrong, okay You thought wrong, Jess.

You know why? Because I'm out here right now by myself in the cold.

I got no support.

Maybe we're just not good enough.

No, you are good enough.

This is not your problem, this is Mr. Bishop's problem.

âª Pah âª Rest.

âª Pah-pah-pah âª

Rest.

âª Pah-pah-pah âª

Rest.

âª Pah-pah-pah... âª

(laughs)

Rest. âª Pah âª

Can you hear it? It's a very famous song.

Mr. Bishop...

I'll tell you what.

Here. Here.

You're gonna play these, okay?

Play these until you figure it out.

Right? Don't play these.

(laughs)

And what are you laughing at, WNBA?

This is what you look like.

(mumbling nonsensically)

You look like you're fighting off a shark.

Okay, this is what I want.

Mr. Bishop!

Petting a dolphin.

Oh, yeah, there we go.

All right, and you...

You didn't make me want to throw up.

Really?

Now, come on, people!

Out!

What?

Get out. You're out of the group. You're being mean.

Fine. I don't need this.

I warned y'all about these bells.

Told you, told you, told you.

I'm gonna make you guys a pitcher of my famous virgin Sangria.

Isn't that just juice?

(screams)

This has to stop!

It's not my w*r!

(door opens, closes)

Hey, uh, maybe Jess is right.

Maybe we should talk this thing through.

Absolutely, man.

Yeah?

Yeah.

All right, I'm gonna put a clean shirt on.

Great, man.

What is that, man?

I'm sorry. I put your couch and your freezer in your room, Schmidt.

Yeah, I didn't want to get my poor on them.

I got to get in there, man. I'm a mess.

I have to go to a networking event later.

Scott Caan is speaking!

Ugh, would you listen to yourself?

Did you use my conditioner?

What? No.

No, I can tell, man.

What are you doing?

(sniffing)

Lotusberry Relax. Lotusberry Relax.

I can smell it on you right now!

Fine! Stop smelling my hair!

You know how much that stuff costs?

Okay, Schmidt, I didn't use your conditioner.

Why does your hair look so baby soft?!

Fine, Schmidt!

I ran out of shampoo and I used your conditioner.

We're talking about conditioner, right?

You used it as shampoo?!

It's for moisture, Nick, not for cleaning!

I can't believe we're friends. Give me it back, man.

Give you what back?

Give me it back.

Think about what you're doing right now.

I'm squeezing it out of your hair.

You're squeezing it out of my hair?

Yes, I am.

Stop squeezing it out of my hair!

Okay, yeah.

It's on.

It's on. It's happening.

Oh, it is?

Yeah, it is happening.

Oh, you want ...

Okay, it is.

These are the first moments of what is happening right now.

This is the beginning of what's happening right now!

Want to get your hands dirty?

Yeah, man.

Whoa!

Come on, Schmidt!

You little rich boy sissy!

Come on! Who you gonna hire to fight me, boy?!

Stop running!

Stop running, Schmidt!

You want it so bad, you got it!

Okay!

Enough!

Where is this coming from, man?

Look, you chose to be a bartender.

You chose to drop out of law school.

You're not some down-on-your-luck hardscrabble guy, you're just a loser who...

I didn't mean...

It's fine, man.

Okay.

(sighs)

Whatever, whatever, whatever, man.

(chuckles)

(sighs)

Just, these are the things that come out, man, when you take another man's conditioner.

Winston, we need to talk.

We had a dress rehearsal.

It was horrible.

(kids clamoring, screaming)

Stop it!

Hey!

(bells ringing)

Those are expensive!

Hector! Hector!

(screaming wildly)

I'm sorry, Jess, but I really don't care.

You know what, I love running this group.

It gives me confidence, it gives me muscle definition.

Yes, sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines where I literally can't see three feet in front of myself.

But I love these kids.

And I'm sorry I kicked you out of group, but one thing you can't do with these kids is make it about you.

Jess, I don't see what the big deal is, okay?

I only practiced with you guys a couple of times.

You're such a tonkel!

Whoa, hold it!

Don't nobody call me a tonkel.

If you tell them they aren't good, that's one more person telling them that.

That's a big deal to me, making sure no one else gives up on them.

Even if they sound like a guy covered in bells falling down a staircase that's also made of bells.

I know you've had a hard month, I know you don't have a job, but, God, they're just kids.

Also, what happened to the refrigerator and the sofa?

Did we get robbed by giants?

You know what sucks about getting older?

Your friends have known you for way too long.

They've got too much on you.

Yep.

I want friends who still lie to me,

'cause they don't want to hurt my feelings.

Mm.

I sadly kind of mean that.

What happened to us, man?

We used to be so cool.

I was going to play basketball and be a gazillionaire.

(chuckles):

Right. And I told myself I was never going to live with Schmidt.

Who do you live with now?

I live with Schmidt, and he's k*lling me, Winston, he's k*lling me.

(laughs)

(sighs)

I got fired from a temp job.

(chuckles)

Yeah, I got kicked out of bell group for being too mean to kids.

Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

That's a low point. You ain't got to talk to me, I know it.

(laughs)

I know it, man.

But I was just enjoying being good at something.

Yeah.

I mean, what does she want me to do, not care about what the songs sound like?

Winston, this is your thing though.

It's not always about being the best.

It's not always about you, Winston.

This is about kids.

Just pass the ball.

(chuckles)

(sighs)

("Eye of the Tiger"

by Survivor playing)

I'll drive, pal.

Hey.

Want to go to this bells concert?

Let me get my cardigan.

JESS:

I know you guys are nervous.

I know you want to do a really great job and you want to sound really great, but it's not about that.

There's a really big crowd of people who's really excited and wants to hear some bells today.

Just look.

All right, bring it in.

(grunting)

JESS:

Hello, Pershing Park!

We are...

ALL:

Ensembell.

MAN:

What? What'd you say?

I said, um, Ensembell.

She said Ensembell!

It's on the banner, stupid!

MAN: You guys gonna play something?

(chuckles)

But first, I'd like to welcome Winston Bishop to the stage.

WOMAN:

Hey, what's a Winston Bishop?

(grunts)

Hey.

(chuckles)

What's up?

"Eye the Tiger"?

Yo, Hector, you think we can pull this off?

Probably not.

Yeah, I don't think so, either.

So let's do it.

One, two, three, four.

(playing "Eye of the Tiger")

Two, three, four.

You know I don't think you're a loser, right?

I can't hear anything you say when you wear that sweater, Schmidt.

You open your mouth and I just hear: "Cardigan, cardigan.

I am wearing a cardigan."

SCHMIDT:

This is super embarrassing.

NICK:

Yeah, it's terrible.

âª It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight âª
âª Rising, watching us all with the eye... âª

You don't like the cardy?

No.

âª Fourth Thursday in November âª
âª That is when we must remember âª
âª How the Pilgrims would have d*ed âª
âª If not for friendship of a tribe... âª

Hi.

Hi.

Thank you so much for helping backstage. This year.

Really, it's made such a difference.

That's nice.

Yeah.

How... how is your boyfriend?

We broke up.

Oh, sorry.

Good riddance! Just kidding.

Oh.

What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

Well, I always spend it with my grandmother...

That's so nice.

But she just d*ed.

Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

That's terrible. When?

Well, it was about a month ago.

It was while I was writing the Halloween madrigal.

No wonder it was so deep.

âª What's it all about? âª
âª Is there any point? âª
âª Do we start dying âª
âª the moment we are born...? âª

Well, I better go warm up the gourds.

Paul!

Yeah?

Well... Oh!

What is that?

I went to five grocery stores, and I got the last turkey in America.

No, Jess, we're not doing Thanksgiving, okay?

We talked about this.

We're just gonna watch football, drink beer and then we are going to Best Buy for Black Friday.

Or as I like to call it, "Friday."

It's our thing, Jess. It's Dudesgiving.

Okay, no matter how many e-mails you send, that's not a thing.

It's real, man. It's totally real.

It's not real.

We're not calling it that.

It has been two years since I've had an American Thanksgiving.

We talked about this.

Look, it's not a big deal.

I'm just cooking dinner for you guys... and Paul.

What?

What?

Hmm? What?

Did you say "and Paul"?

Who's Paul?

Did you invite somebody named Paul to our house?

Yes, I did. I asked someone out.

Asked someone out?

Jess, be honest ... is the turkey named Paul?

It's a real guy.

And he teaches at my school.

And he's really, really hot!

And the turkey is named Hank ... Hanksgiving.

And we are gonna eat him, so...

Hanksgiving.

âª Hey, girl âª

visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com

âª What you doing? âª

visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com

âª Hey, girl âª

visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com

âª Where you going? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com Don't worry, guys, I will do everything.

Are we gonna be able to hang out with Paul or is he also a teacher?

No, he's a total guy's guy.

He normally spends Thanksgiving with his nana, but she just passed away.

That's a great plan, Jess, be the girl who replaces his d*ad nana.

I know!

Guys, look, this is a bad idea.

He's gonna be our fifth roommate, I'm telling you.

It's a first date.

We don't know him, okay? We got to figure out whether or not he's the right guy for us.

We deserve to be happy.

You guys, don't even get up.

Just enjoy your beers. It's gonna be a great meal.

Just curious, does anybody know anything about cooking?

Mm-mmm.

No pressure.

Just, like, cooking a turkey, for example.

It says you need some kind of string.

Trussing string.

Don't, Schmidt!

That's a good turkey tip. You got more?

Here's a tip: Don't cook Thanksgiving dinner for five people in 14 hours.

Here's another tip: don't ask a guy out on a first date on the least sexy holiday in America.

What are the most sexy holidays?

The most sexy holidays are Fourth of July, uh, Independence Day, obviously, Women's History Month and Christmas.

Will you help me?

No, definitely not.

What if I invite Cece?

Don't do it, Schmidt. Beer, football, Black Friday.

Thanksgiving with Cece.

No, Schmidt.

Okay.

No, no, no, no!

No, Schmidt!

But I want to let you know up front that I've got some control issues in the kitchen, so I'm gonna do this, I'm cooking the whole meal.

I don't want you touching anything.

And I don't want to hear,

"Schmidt, Schmidt, you're using too much tarragon,"

because I'm not.

You will never hear that from me.

I'm in.

Come on, Schmidt!

Yes!

So, this guy's gonna thaw out by tomorrow, right?

What are we, scientists?

Oh!

Hey, look at that, it's ready.

What am I gonna do?! He comes in three hours!

Oh, God, I can't get it in!

We've all been here, am I right?

Jar.

Maybe if I take off all my clothes and I get in bed with him, the heat of my body will warm it up.

I'm not gonna lie. This is turning me on a little bit. - It is?

Hey, guys.

Cece! Thank God. Come down here and lie on the turkey with me.

Oh, hell, yeah, do that.

Yeah, do it. That'd be good.

This is a terrible idea.

Yeah, 100%.

I put it on permanent press.

Good, so you don't have to iron it.

(knocking)

No! He's here early! How do I look?

It's better if you don't know.

Hi!

Hey!

Come on in.

All right.

Paul, everybody!

Hey.

Hey-yo.

Welcome to our home.

Thank you. Hey.

âª It ain't so quirky to eat a lot of turkey âª
âª On this Thanksgiving Day-ay-ay. âª
âª My belly's wanting something âª
âª A pie made out of pumpkin âª
âª In every gobble-gobble way-ay-ay. âª

(both snicker)

I didn't know you were going back to back.

Happy Thanksgiving.

Oh, my God, there's two of them.

It's good to see you.

Um...

So, I'm just gonna freshen up.

Oh, thanks.

And I'll be right back.

I forgot to tell you, Paul brought his violin, and with a little coaxing, he fiddle with the old horsehairs.

Only if you don't mind being enchanted.

(both laugh)

I just want to watch the game.

Hey, Nick, can I talk to you?

I just need you not to do that thing that you do.

What thing? I don't do a thing.

Yes, you get all mean and you make that little turtle face.

Okay, I don't think I make a turtle face.

Just talk to him like a normal human being.

Not about politics or small business loans or the Google conspiracy thing, okay?

I've only seen him at school, and I really want to wow him tonight, okay?

Please, he's the only guy I've liked since Spencer.

I'm not good at this stuff, so please just help me.

All right, fine, I'll help you.

Shake on that, pardner?

I don't want to do it like that, though.

Fair enough.

Fair enough.

Can I sit here?

CECE:

Parsley?

Guy roommates.

Three guys.

It's intimidating.

I gotta be honest, it's intimidating coming to that arena.

It's hard to get to know people.

It's like Goldilocks

and the Three Bears.

Bet you're the bear who has the bed that's just right.

Hmm.

It's a teacher joke, sorry.

Okay, here's what we're gonna do, Paul.

Um, just so I get to know you a little better and you can know me better, Yeah.

We're gonna play a little game.

Oh, great. Fun, yeah.

All right, I'm gonna say something, and you're gonna say the first thing that pops in your head.

Kazoo.

Okay, we haven't even started yet.

Okay. I'm gonna stick with kazoo.

Right, okay, um,

"boundaries."

Important.

Okay, um,

"other people's stuff."

Private.

Good. Uh, "loud early morning sex."

Nice work if you can get some.

(toots)

Hey, Paul.

Hey, Nicholas.

What's going on, guys? Nicholas, wow.

Just two dudes playing word-association games, kicking back a couple of pumpkin ales.

I think that's a lager, right?

Mm-mm, this is an ale. It has to do with the fermentation process.

Could be, could be.

Uh, hey, do you want to watch football, the Lions?

Ah, yes! The mighty, mighty Lions of Des Moines.

They play every Thanksgiving, right, because they're the most ferocious of the teams.

Lions from Detroit. Detroit Lions.

That's another...

What you gobbling about, turkeys?

(both laugh)

Anyone who tells you the future of gravy is nitrogen-based is cooking with blinders on, Cece.

What is...? Are you...? Did you wash your hands?

I'll wash them after.

Okay, no.

See, just, can you just stop?

Because now the entire bowl of walnuts is compromised.

Wow. You're very sanitary.

Do you wash your hands ten times a day?

Okay, look, don't worry, Cece.

If I need to, I can get my hands dirty.

I mean, I get dirty all over.

Would you eat this filthy walnut?

Yeah, I mean, I'd eat the... yeah.

Okay, open your mouth. Open your mouth, Schmidt.

No!

(water runs)

Beautiful savage.

Oh, intermission.

No, it's halftime.

It's parade time.

It's robot turkey.

You know, it was Grandma's favorite.

We used to love watching the parade together.

She was the best.

Check it out. Here she is.

Here's the lady.

Oh, she's beautiful!

Yeah. We used to get in the funniest arm-wrestling matches.

(chuckles)

Hey, can I show you something?

Uh, picture here. That's my grandpa.

Aw...

d*ed last year.

I'm so sorry. Sorry, Winston.

Thanks. Thanks, man. It's okay.

This picture right here was when he tried to quit drinking. That was a bad idea for everybody.

This is the first time he tried gelatto.

He did not like that.

What was his name?

His name was Nelson.

Hey, Schmidt, how's it going?

Well, I need some walnuts. I have no walnuts.

I should go get those. You should stay here with the turkey.

Though, sh**t. I have had two pumpkin ales.

I probably shouldn't get behind the wheel of a car.

Nick, how many pumpkin ales have you had?

Oh, I've had zero pumpkin ale.

Then can you take Paul to the store, right?

(softly): âª Getting some walnuts, getting some walnuts. âª

I'm sorry, man, are you singing about what we're doing?

Yeah, guess I was.

Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it.

Where are you from?

Chicago.

Oh, land of plenty.

It's weird being in L.A.

It doesn't feel like Thanksgiving.

It feels like there should be, like, a little nip in the air, you know?

A little bit like...

Yeah, totally.

...an autumn crisp.

So, Jess said you're a lawyer, right?

I dropped out of law school. I had three semesters to go.

Oh, what?! So close!

So you're still trying to figure it out, right?

That's what your 20s are for.

I'm 30, so...

Oh, Mr. Copycat.

(chuckles)

That's where I get my copies made.

No way! Yep!

You get your copies there?!

I don't, I don't. It was the other one.

Oh, you have got to be kidding me, man. - No.

That's right.

I need long sustained mashes.

Oh, hey, you've got something on your nose right...

What?! What?!

No!

What is wrong with you?

Look at this recipe. Look at the recipe.

Where in this recipe does it say "put mashed potatoes on Schmidt's nose"?

Look at it. No. Here? Here? Here?

Go on, show me!

Schmidt!

Oh, hey. Hey.

NICK: Look, Paul, move.

We got the nuts, Jess.

I don't think Nick likes me very much.

No.

(loud bang)

(hissing)

Turkey!

Turkey's on f*re! f*re!

Jar.

It's like a Prince video.

Oh, my God.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I really wanted you to have a good time.

Remember when it was only dudes living here, and we had no fires?

This is ridiculous.

Three months ago we didn't even know this girl.

My Lasik'd eye is freaking out.

Okay, that's it. We're leaving. Guys, let's get out of here.

I've had a great time.

Paul, I am so sorry.

We're going to the bar. We can't get rid of the smoke.

Wait.

Wait, wait, wait! Hold on, we can still do this. What are you guys doing?

I have been dying to try that food you've been cooking all day.

You've been slaving away in there.

What's your name again?

Schmidt.

Right.

You know, it's my last name.

Well, my last name is Genzlinger, and I'd like to eat the food that you've been making all day, Schmidt.

Yeah, all right. Genzlinger.

I'm with Genzlinger.

JESS: I have an idea!

Let's go next door.

Mrs. Beverly's really great. She's visiting her sister, but she gave me her spare key for emergencies.

So we're breaking and entering. That's a felony, FYI.

Hey, law school! Nice!

JESS:

No, we're not breaking in.

I gave her a key to our place, too.

She sometimes has a problem with her shower.

No, not you.

What are you doing? You promised me you'd be nice to him.

I was nice to him! I've been very nice to Paul.

NICK: The whole car ride over I was nice to him.

You know what he tells me about?

He likes Air Bud 2.

He loves dogs. I know where he gets his copies made. He likes to whistle.

He wanted to open the door with me, so when my hand went up, so did his.

Oh, I get it.

He's not cool enough for you.

'Cause nobody can be cool enough for cool Nick Miller.

I'm Nick Miller.

I'm so cool, I'll make my cool face.

Why don't you like him?

NICK:

Who cares? Do you like him?

JESS:

Of course I like him.

Okay, fine! It doesn't matter what I think, does it?

'Cause I don't have to have sex with him.

I do. I want to.

I want to have sex with him big-time.

NICK: Great.

JESS: You heard me!

Big-time! Okay?

I want to take him down to Chinatown and slice him off a piece of this pumpkin pie, okay?

What is pumpkin pie?

JESS: I want to do all the things that you do in a bedroom, with him, okay?

I want to do it standing up and sitting down, and half-up and half-down, and the wiggly one, and the Bear att*ck, and the claws in the head, and the one the figure skaters do, and the What's For Lunch, and the... Give Me That Hat. Let's just say that I'm good. I'm really, really good.

And I don't care what you think!

Then why did you ask me?

Hey, Jess.

Uh... just want you to know everyone really loves Paul.

And also, we can hear everything you're saying.

What?

Play through.

After you, Jess.

Excuse me.


So, um... just a heads-up.

Uh... we're just rehearsing a play that, uh, Nick is writing. It's called...

"Big-Time."

It's... it's about a man who, um, loves another man named Paul and it's not very good.

I'm so sorry.

I've done Give Me That Hat.

Only for me it was like, I, you know, I was like, I was like, "Here, take my hat."

Do you know what I mean?

(plucking strings)

So how bad was it, on a scale from one to bad?

Let's put it this way:

a normal guy would've left a long time ago and he's still here, right?

He's not normal.

Schmidt yelled at me earlier.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Did he get weird? He's weird about cooking.

Did you touch his whisk?

CECE:

No, the thing is, Jess...

is I think I'm into him.

What? Oh, God.

Yeah, he's got this rage inside of him, this fury, and I just love it.

NICK: Hey, Schmidt?

It's hour nine. I'm starving.

Well, I can blanch or I can talk, but I can't do both.

I'm going in.

(violin string twangs)

Nick...

I gotta just say something to you.

I feel like... you think I'm kind of annoying.

You didn't have to come here to say that.

You could've done it from over there. - Okay.

And if that's the case ... which I don't know that it is ...

It is.

I don't care.

I actually feel sort of sorry for you, because at this point in your life I know that you'll never dislike me more than you dislike yourself.

Really? That's what you're going with, Violin?

Want a little, um, napkin-folding music?

(laughs)

Kind of need it.

I can't believe you're still here.

What do you mean? Of course I'm still here.

Why wouldn't I be here?

Hey.

Let's talk about what happened earlier.

'Cause you made me feel like I was a really bad girl.

I know I did, and...

I'm really sorry, Cece.

I'll never yell at you like that again.

How about now?

Please... Please don't do that.

Got my dirty little hands in your pudding. - Can you...

So gross...

It's so gross, please... Oh, God.

Mmm...

(gags)

So gross.

Yell.

I really... I'd really rather you not do that.

I haven't washed my hands since 3:00, and I'm gonna double-dip.

It's so gross...

How about now?

It's all the way, it's all the way in there, with all the...

it's so unsanitary. Please, just put it...

I'm-I'm begging you to... Please just take the towel!

This may be none of my business, but I-I-I really have to ask you:

Did anything happen between you and Nick?

Like, did you guys go out, or ...

What?

'Cause I, I really don't want to get in the middle of anything.

No. No.

No, no, no, no.

No.

Good.

Because I really want to see you again.

Big-time.

(laughs)

Big-time.

Big-time.

Like the play.

Yeah.

Cool play.

It is.

Do you really like him, Winston?

Yes, man! He asked me my grandpa's name.

You've never asked me my grandpa's name.

I don't know, Winston, I always just thought he was your grandpa.

I mean, you don't know my grandpa's name.

You mean Mason on your dad's, or Charles on your mom's?

Yeah, it's Mason and Charles.

SCHMIDT:

Ho, ho, ho, baby.

JESS:

Oh, that looks lovely.

Genzlinger!

Schmidt!

Yeah, buddy.

You kidding me?

Oh, it looks incredible.

It really does.

What if you play something for us before we start?

Before? Oh, no, no.

Yes!

Please?

Play.

You're all hungry. You know you want to do it.

Just do it. - Okay. - Please?

Twist my arm. - Okay.

All right. - Yeah.

Uh, duet from the pageant, huh?

(Whispering) Oh.

PAUL: Big entrance.

JESS: Okay.

Native Americans, gather ye round for I have a new friend I've met in the forest.

(Paul screams)

d*ad body! d*ad body!

PAUL: Holy God!

There's a d*ad body in there.

I think there's a d*ad body. There's a d*ad body!

There's a d*ad body!

Oh! That is real.

Ooh.

Oh! God.

That's a real thing.

What? (screams)

Poor Mrs. Beverly.

Oh, Ms. Beverly from the mailboxes.

I'm so sorry, Paul.

Oh, it was so fun. I had a great time.

WINSTON:

Anytime, bro.

Hey, listen, we're gonna go to a Best Buy, later, and grab a new dryer. Totally stop by if you need anything.

Oh, good, good. Okay. Thank you.

Oh. Okay.

All right.

Cool. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no.

Coming in. Coming in.

Guys...

No, no, no.

Get clear.

At least she d*ed doing what she loved.

She was on the toilet, Jess.

I'm starving.

Really? Even after that great meal we didn't have?

Oh, come on, Jess.

Are you going to be mad at me all night?

Are you cold?

Do you want my cardie?

(violin playing)

You came.

Yeah.

When I was on that elevator ride from hell, the coroners told me to stop crying like a girl.

I told them that was sexist.

You're right.

I am right.

And then I decided, life is too short.

So I went around the corner, picked up a couple of turkey subs for your friends ...

Yup.

They're foot-longers ...

and... here I am.

Just a man and his violin.

You're amazing.

MAN: Hey, no cutting!

Is he cutting?

He's not cutting. Relax.

Guys! We got a cutter here!

NICK: Calm down, pal. Stop.

(crowd murmurs angrily)

He's not cutting.

He's not cutting.

He's... I saved his spot.

Calm down.

False alarm!

He's just doing fair tradesies.

Honestly, stop overreacting to cutting!

I'm going to the back of the line. This spot's for Paul.

Thanks, Nick.

Thank you, Nick.

Hey. Nick.

Wait.

CECE:

Let's go. Come on.

Hey, I'll go back there, too.

JESS:

âª Thursday in November âª

BOTH:

âª That's the day we remember âª
âª How the Pilgrims would have d*ed... âª

It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

âª If not for friendship of a tribe âª
âª Oh, oh, oh... âª
âª Why don't you take the fiddle âª
âª Fiddle it up and fiddle it down âª
âª Fiddle it all over town. âª

(laughing, whooping)

NICK: Where the hell are they going?

Cece!

Beep-beep.

(arguing)

Beep-beep.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

These traffic patterns are really...

counterintuitive!

Really...

Catch-as-catch-can as far as footpaths go over here!

Cece!

I got your text.

Are you ready to go home?

Argh! Thank you for coming.

Jess, he was making out with another girl.

You... get away from here.

Okay, who are you, Miss Pajama, okay?

You're blocking my booth. Get out of here!

Don't talk to her like that, okay?

That is my best friend!

(laughs) Oh, Cece...

You ripped my deep V!

This is my favorite deep V!

ItÂ´s just a deeper V.

Thanks for picking me up, Jess.

I really felt that Gavin was different.

Didn't you feel like he was different?

Yeah.

I mean, he seemed like a really nice...

European DJ with a face tattoo.

(men whistling, car horn honking)

Whoo!

Hey, guys.

I think... Jess, I think these guys are into you.

We should, we should just go back, right?

We should totally head back.

Where am I taking you?

Well, can't go home because Gavin's, like, staying at my place.

You've known him for three weeks.

Can I just crash with you for a couple days? Please?

I don't know. It's Friday night.

The guys probably have big plans.

(video game music playing)

Friday night, gentlemen.

It's on.

What happened to you?

It's on and poppin' up in here, you feel?

What happened to you?

What?

You didn't used to be like this, Schmidt.

What are you talking about?

You've gotten so much worse.

It's on and poppin'!

âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? âª
âª Who's that girl? Who's that girl? âª
âª It's Jess. âª

Yes. I told you I'd come through.

Okay, Benjamin just invited us to a very cool party.

I just got off three back-to-back shifts at the bar.

I just want to sit here all weekend in silence playing this game, then I want to go in my room and do weird stuff on my computer.

Are you even wearing underwear?

What is between you and that chair?

Just a little bit of sunshine.

(chuckles) All right, take off that kimono, please.

It's my leisure wear, Winston.

Look, I worked

80 hours this week.

I just want to come home, put on my 'mono and just hang loose, man.

Okay? If you had a job, you'd understand.

R-Really?

Wow! It just got real in here.

Okay, you're not gonna take the kimono off?

Fine. Then I'm not wearing any pants.

Boom! Bam!

Mm-hmm. Everybody want to just walk around this house wearing all kinds of stupid stuff, then guess what I'm gonna do, Schmidt.

I'm wearing a napkin on my face.

Bam! How you like that?

That doesn't even make any sense, Winston.

It makes perfect sense.

Totally different than me wearing my kimono.

You are laughing in the face of thousands of years of samurai culture, and it's an affront, Winston, it's an affront.

Look at me now, huh? This is the vibe we have in the house now because of you.

You want to walk around here looking silly.

This is handcrafted! In China.

(grumbles)

Schmidt, I think you should take the kimono off.

Um, Cece, can you not do your usual thing?

These are really good guys.

Best behavior.

Sure.

(men arguing)

Hey, guys, I brought...

You brought this on yourself!

What you doing?

Oh, you know, we're just chillin'.

Just chillin'.

Just doing this.

You know, Friday night.

I'm gonna use the ladies'.

What's up, Cecelia?

Where's the tequila?

Guys.

(sighs) Okay.

I would normally never bring her here, but Cece's really vulnerable right now, and when she's drunk, she has no boundaries.

So she's really grabby, really physical, she's really loose with her body.

So I just want to apologize in advance for anything that she might do.

That's good to know.

Yeah, thanks for telling us.

Thank you, guys.

You're the best.

(Dance music playing loudly)

This is the opposite of being alone!

This is the opposite of what I wanted this weekend.

Wow, how'd this happen?

Okay, I'm not a part of this, Schmidt.

I'm not a part of this.

Hi, Cece.

I'm gonna make you a bed on the couch, okay?

You have to stop dancing, okay, so you can go to sleep.

(deep voice): You know, Cece, I think you should dance if you want to.

Why are you talking like that?

Like what? I'm just hanging out.

You get up.

Really? Him?

But I'm doing this.

Come on, get up!

No, I don't dance.

I'm from the town in Footloose.

He doesn't want to dance, Cece.

I don't wanna dance. I'm really good.

Schmidt dances... Whoa! What the...

All right, you know what, I'm gonna go to bed. Good night.

That's really not great under here.

You have to love hair.

I think it's time for bed.

You can use my bed;

I'll sleep on the couch.

Over here. Over here, Cece.

Oh.

Over here. Over here.

Are you sheepdogging her?

Over here, over here.

Over here, over here.

Not here. Here we go.

(sighs)

Good night, Cece.

(music stops)

Yes! Yes.

She is sleeping on my sheets right now.

Not yours, bro. Mine.

Parkour!

You know what? I think I might actually have a chance with her.

I just have to be cooler than that guy.

Parkour!

A wise man once foretold of a magical night where I would engage in nonsexual foreplay with a model, my friends.

And tonight...

Don't say...is that night.

No, not a chance. Never gonna happen.

You're not a closer.

Oh, I'm a closer. I'm gonna close this conversation right now, my brother.

Watch this. Boom, bam, closed.

Parkour!

Short track speed skating.

Apolo Ohno.

Well, at least this tires him out, right?

Yeah.

Look, she's great. You're gonna love her.

Do you want some eggs?

No, I've got my own breakfast.

I don't need you to...

What?

I don't know.

Take care of me.

Just stop being so nice.

Your mother's being so nice.

Slam on my mother.

Your mother's gonna slam on your mother.

(screams)

And 4,000.

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Wilkommen.

You're covered in oil?

What, oil? No.

This is just, uh...

You okay?

Schmidt.

Hey, are you okay?

Whoa. Whoa.

I just blacked out for a second.

Anything weird happen?

Okay, I need some water, so can you move?

Yeah, that's not gonna happen, honey.

Just, you know, slide me like a curtain, okay?

(groans)

There you go. I'm good. I'm good.

Sweet.

Hey, can you get me a coff...

(shower running)

What's going on, guys? I ...

Hey. Oh, you're all here.

Um, does the water gets any hotter than this?

Uh, do you want me...

Uh I mean, I could give you, if...

NICK: I could... I'm good at fixing I can fix it, also.

Actually, you know what, I'll just figure it out myself.

But do you guys have any actual soap?

Because all I can find in here is body gelato.

That would be Schmidt's ...

Schmidt's gelato.

That gelato is mine.

If you could just... Don't use it all.

I'll just not touch it.

Okay.

Hey. Why are you guys all in here?

I'm brushing my teeth.

D-Doing my thing.

She hogging the shower? Cece come on. Hurry up.

CECE:

Sorry, j just... I can't find any bigger towels for some reason.

You have a really beautiful body, Cece.

I really appreciate that about you.

Okay, come on.

I did you breakfast.

You did?

Yeah.

Sorry. I just...

Disappointed with all of you.

Especially you.

It was a bad moment.

I thought you were better than that.

I know. I am sometimes.

Did you see that cleavage?

I just want to get my arm stuck down there.

127 Hours style.

And then, and then...

Just cut it for days. I don't care.

I'll cut through the bone, the nerve.

(makes snapping sound)

Schmidt!

You weren't upset 'cause I was dancing with Nick, right?

No, of course not.

'Cause I think he's really into you.

Nick?! No.

No!

Come on, Jess.

This is classic Eduardo.

You want this to go to Cece, right?

(heavy accent):

"Jess."

Okay, I'll give it to Cece.

No. Jess!

You don't want me to give it to Cece?

SÃ­, sÃ­... uh, for you.

For me?

To give to Cece.

(groans)

We're just friends.

You can't be friends with these guys.

You don't think that every single one of them has thought about sleeping with you?

No, you just think everyone wants to sleep with everyone all the time.

They do. That's why I think that.

Don't you hear how he says your name?

"Jess."

He's from Chicago.

That's how people from Chicago say "Jess."

(Chicago accent):

Like "Bears" and "milk"

and "Let's go visit the Sears Tower."

(knocking)

Hey, Jess.

I'm going to the drugstore.

Need anything?

Yes.

Jess, you should go with him,

'cause then you can get that thing that you really need.

Oh, I wonder what that is.

She'll be right out.

Yeah, just...

No. No!

No, you are not coming in here and ruining all this.

I'm happy, I like these guys, and I think they're actually starting to like me, too.

Who did you tell me was your perfect man?

Walter Matthau in Grumpy Old Men.

And I could be girl Jack Lemmon.

He's a total Matthau!

I'm telling you, he gets you.

And did you see his feet?

A guy's feet point at what they want.

His feet were pointing right at you.

Why wouldn't his feet point at me?

Otherwise, he's standing like a duck.

Just come on. Go. Get out there.

NICK:

Hey, you ready?

Come on!

Be there in a sec, bro!

You just call me "bro"?

Yeah.


Well, how long is she staying?

Oh, not long.

I know she can be tough to deal with.

Sometimes she just calls me up and she's like,

"Bitch, I love you."

And then she just hangs up.

No other information.

Weird.

But I don't know, I kind of like it when she calls me "bitch."

It makes me feel like Janis Joplin.

NICK: Fine, but does she have to stay with us?

What? I'm sorry.

What-What did you say?

I'm saying stop trying to take care of everyone.

Oh, my God.

What?

What? - What!

Nothing. What?

What?

What are you doing?

I know she's your best friend, but I-I didn't mean to insult you.

Just, you don't have to take care of her...

Okay.

Yes.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

I'm sorry, I'm just checking...

I just want to make sure...

If I insulted you, I'm sorry.

But what are you doing right now?

Everything's in its place.

What does that mean?

Okay.

I'm just walking like a friend.

Okay, you know what, forget this.

Let's get out of here. Last on the list...

toilet paper.

Um, I don't use it.

You don't use toilet paper?

I mean... That's not what I meant.

That's what your mother meant.

What, did my mother call? What did she say?

No, Jess, I was... Jess, I was joking.

(whistles)

Look at her.

Go for it, man. You know, go do your thing.

I don't like the roof, man. There's a cat up here.

It's crazy. It was raised by birds.

You mean to tell me you're going to let a cat stop you from all that?

It's a bird-cat, man.

It's very dangerous. Look it up. Double rabies.

Right. You can't close.

You just said the magic words, son.

Baby, baby, don't cry.

Look, I get it.

I was the best lover you ever had.

Yeah. A 90-minute session's pretty standard for me.

It was god what?

Oh, it was godlike.

That's very sweet of you to say.

(phone ringing)

WINSTON:

My bad.

Pocket dialed you.

I got dropped calls, then Winston calls. It's crazy.

Uh, the roof, you know what I mean?

Hey, look, if he's ever bothering you...

You both are.

Cool, that's cool.

(cat meowing)

NICK: Okay, what's going on

with you, Jess?

Why do you have to do that?

Do what?

Why do you have to say my name like that? "Jess."

And why do you have to wear old man clothes all the time?

I don't wear old man clothes. You don't like the way I dress?

No, I just...

Did I do something to you?

No, I just need air.

Rose for the lady?

No.

Okay, I'll buy you one. Or two... they come as two? - No, no.

I'll buy two. - No, no.

Great. Thank you.

Wait, what do you mean no? Here, take some roses.

Want 'em? It's two dollars, it's not a big deal.

I want them to go, no.

They're nice roses...

Hey, what are you doing?! Where are you going?

Jess, it was a joke.

What are you doing? Get back in the car.

Where are you going?

That's not the way home.

Just working on Saturday.

Pulling in them ducats. It's crazy.

It's like golden handcuffs, you know what I mean?

It's like, on one hand I'm k*lling myself, and on the other hand, I'm making all this baller dough.

Ow!

Sunburn.

I told you to take that oil off.

It's cool, man. It's just a little color.

In a couple days I'll be brown just like you, Cece.

Because... because your culture is...

What is my culture?

It's, um... you're... Fff...

Um... Jjj... Jaflan...

Jafanese?

Uh, Sa-Saudi...

Saudiboo...

Um...

Monga...

My parents were born in India.

India... totally. Love India.

He really does.

Hey, Schmidt, why don't you tell her about all the things you love about India.

Uh, sure. I love, you know, uh, I love Slumdog.

I love naan, uh, pepper, Ben Kingsley, the stories of Rudyard Kipling.

I have respect for cows, of course.

I love, uh, the Taj Mahal, Deepak Chopra, anyone named Patel.

I love monsoons.

I love... I love cobras and baskets, Naveen Andrews.

I love mango chutney, uh, really, any type of chutney.

Teepees...

Hey, Schmidt, take a lap. Refresh.

Yep.

That was pretty good.

I know.

You're working a little too hard, though.

Watch this. Schmidt!

Yo.

Go up to the roof.

Yeah, I'm going to go up to the roof.

I'll be there in ten minutes.

Cool. See you in, like, ten.

That was absolutely...

Make me a sandwich.

Sandwich.

I walked home.

I got out of the car and I walked home.

Why, what happened?

His feet were pointed directly at me the whole time.

Did I do this? Am I dressing too provocatively? Do I need to get thicker pajamas?

Maybe it's my posture. I have really sexy posture.

Don't worry about it.

I will talk to him for you.

No, you won't. That would be the worst, most life-ruining thing you could possibly...

Hi, Nick.

Seriously, Jess, what the hell happened? I've been driving around for the last hour looking for you.

Everything is okay, and we were hoping to get everything out...

BOTH: on the table.

The table which is not a table, it doesn't exist.

Don't worry about the table.

We were in the middle of traffic and you just got out and ran away.

I was hot.

You were so hot that you had to jump out of my car and run?

Why are you standing like that?

This is how I stand.

I've never seen you stand like that.

I was really worried something had happened to you, okay?

And you can't just walk around this neighborhood with bags full of toilet paper, that you don't even use.

What?

I told him I don't use toilet paper.

Okay, do you hear what he is saying to you?

Yes, I hear what he's saying ...

He's trying to tell you he cares about you.

No, he doesn't care about me.

So I'm going to make this happen for you.

He cares about me as a friend.

This is so on, Jess.

No, it is not.

No, on it is not.

I'm trying to help you...

No.

No.

Okay, my face is my job.

My face is my job.

Okay...

(yelling)

No! No!

My earring.

Okay.

It is stuck in your hair.

Can you get it out?

No.

Okay, we'll do it on the floor. We can do it on the floor. - Ow...

We're going to get it on the floor, don't worry. Okay.

Ow. - It'll be okay. All right, here we go.

What is wrong with you?

I'm trying to help you.

No, what is wrong with you?

No. I don't need your help.

You don't know... Nick and I are friends.

You don't know, 'cause you don't have guy friends at all.

You just hang out with jerks like Gavin.

Oh, I'm sorry... DJ Diabeat It.

He has diabetes.

Oh, he does? Boo-hoo.

I'm sorry. Is it really bad? I feel really bad.

He's fine. He takes medication.

Why do you just come in and you take over?

It's like you're playing mind games with people.

Don't put this on me, Jess. Ok, I'm trying to help you. You never make a move...

Well, I don't need your help.

I like moving slow. I like being weird and taking my time.

I'm not like you.

I don't just jump in the potato sack with the first potato that I meet with diabetes.

Okay, what did you just say?

You heard me, bitch.

(both laughing)

(Schmidt screaming) Oh...

What is that?

Oh, no.

What, what did you do?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

What did you do?

(meows)

Hey, Schmidt. How you doing?

Can I sit with you on your cooler here?

Yeah. Just chillin', hanging with the cat.

Hola.

I'm sorry that Cece did this to you.

That's okay. I'm used to it.

I guess I'll just always be the fat kid with the big dreams.

It's not you.

I love Cece, but she's not ready for you.

You're a good guy, You know, if you ignore everything that you do on purpose, and concentrate on all of the things that you do by accident.

Thank you.

She'd eat you up.

You really think she'd eat me up?

Yeah.

Like buffet style?

You know, all you can eat?

'cause I got that prime rib, yo.

Carving station, plates are warm, sneeze guard, kids eat for free. I mean, except for the...

Except for the last...

All right, let's go. Let's go, Schmidt, okay?

Okay.

Hey, Cece. Um...

Look, I get it. This isn't going to happen.

But the couch is super uncomfortable, my sunburn's starting to blister, and I just want to sleep in my own bed.

Okay.

(jungle sounds)

I'm sorry for everything.

I can be a jerk sometimes.

I hate sleeping alone.

Me too.

Sweet.

Sch-weet...

Better when you don't talk.

Yeah.

If you tell anyone we held hands, I have two people in my phone that will k*ll you.

Literally.

Hmm...

Oh.

Hey. (Laughing)

I'm sorry I acted so weird today. Weird!

It's okay.

(brushing teeth)

(phone ringing)

Yo.

SCHMIDT: I did it, man.

I'm holding her hand right now. She's in my bed and she's asleep.

Wait, so you're in... you're in the room right now?

What is wrong with you? Hang up the phone.

I did it. I closed.

We could have this conversation at any time.

Shh. Please, shh.

Okay, we're good.

And just so we're clear, when I say "closing,"

this is not what I'm talking about.

You need to define your terms.

Because what I'm doing right now feels an awful lot like closing.

(woman screaming on TV)

Ooh.

Scary movie.

I hate scary movies.

Why are we watching this?

We're not watching this, Jess.

We're watching it.

(scary movie music continues)

(groans)

So fun, hanging with the dudes, eating ice cream, watching scary movies.

(deep voice):

We're not scared; we're dudes.

Shh!

(woman screaming on TV)

(whispering):

You know what we should watch?

Have you guys ever seen Fame?

It's about a group of dreamers with talent to spare, taking New York City by storm, one dance number at a time...

the cafeteria, the street...

Oh! Ooh!

That's so much blood.

It's spurting!

Mmm, that was good.

That guy's gonna blow himself up.

** Wah, wah.

Why would that guy blow himself up?

(expl*si*n on TV)

Sorry. I saw it in the theater.

You know what else we should watch?

An American Tale.

It's about a little Jewish mouse with a great big heart and a...

All right.

Wait.

New Girl S01E04

"Naked"

== SPREAD THE WORD ==

Do you know where you're taking her? No.

Do you need a list of my sexiest date spots?

You know, it's been a while for you.

Want me to stretch you out?

It's not a date, Schmidt.

Actually, I don't know what it is.

She's, uh... she's a little hard to read.

Wouldn't it be funny if we, like, went out? Like...

Do you want to go on a date? Yeah.

We, like, go for dinner, and, like, the two of us, like, do stuff.

Is that a yes? I know, right?

Seriously, do you want to get dinner...? Right. No, I know.

Sometimes she's so ironic that I think she's being serious.

I get it. Led Zeppelin is classic, but I mean, it's no, like, Steve Miller Band.

Steve Miller Band?

"The Joker"?

Oh, yeah. No, I love The Steve Miller Band.

Hey, look. You've been out of the game for a while.

I have three date packages.

They work every time.

Package A: Close-up magic, dinner, drinks.

Package B: Close-up magic, drinks.

Package C:...

Close-up magic.

You have a date? Fun!

I want to talk to you guys about this stuff.

With Amanda.

Schmidt. Amanda?

From the bar?

Whoa!

She's a looker.

Hatchie-matchie!

Yeah, I know how hot she is, Jess.

Have you been out with anyone since Caroline?

No.

Whoa! Big-deal alert.

Scary stuff, kids.

Yeesh!

Falling rocks. Bridge out. Duck!

This is why I don't talk to you, Jess.

Nick, you're gonna be fine.

Don't worry about it.

Just, you know, suck in the gut.

What gut?

The little pooch where you keep your extra cookies.

I had a lot of adventures in this room while you were gone, Winston.

(sighs) How'd the job interview go?

You know, terrible.

Did you see the JWoww retweet and Gaga Twitpic?

I know Word, and I can open a document...save it, save as, print, print preview...

She just wanted to chitchat about stuff I've never even heard of.

Well, you gotta get up to speed, man.

The chitchat is the interview.

I've spent the last two years of my life in Latvia.

I was playing ball year round.

I didn't read the news.

I have no idea what happened in America.

I've got interviews tomorrow.

Fill me in. What'd I miss?

From... from the past two years?

Give me the highlights. Highlights. Okay.

Uh, country's broke.

Betty White's back.

Oh, cool, cool. What about the rest of the Golden Girls?

All d*ad, man.

Damn. You know what? Give me your computer.

I gotta get started, man. I'm going in.

Hey, Nick, can you...

(giggly scream)

Oh, my God!

Look at you. You're like an animal.

What are you watching now? The King's Speech and Human Centipede.

Next up: Precious and David After Dentist.

I think you're doing a good job.

Okay, you know what, test me.

Pretend this is an interview. h*t me with the chitchat.

Ask me anything.

Chitchat. Let's go.

Forget it, man. Let's go!

Come on, what are you waiting for, man?

You're getting intense right now.

You're the intense one. I think you need to bring it down.

(clears throat)

Can I talk to you for a sec?

Something's happened.

It was totally an accident.

Not a big deal. I just want to do the mature thing and come clean about it.

But, um, I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee.

What? What'd she say?

I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee and his bubbles.

But it's not a big deal.

Ain't no thing.

(door opens)

Ain't no thaaang.

Oh, Nick, hey.

Hey.

So, that was weird, right?

I'm running out the door, Jess.

I think we should talk about it.

Talk about what?

About me seeing...

your peen.

(with British accent):

The peen what I saw.

(with French accent):

Bonjour, le peen.

You're blocking the door.

Okay. Cool.

Have fun on your date.

(laughs awkwardly):

Tell that guy to behave.

The adventure begins.

Okay. Excuse me, Jess.

(groaning)

That was so horrible. What am I gonna do?

He's never gonna speak to me again. I'm so embarrassed.

It's not a big deal. I've seen Nick's stuff, like, a million times.

You have?

I mean... how?

We grew up togethe Locker rooms, swimming pools, penis fights... it just happens.

Why haven't I seen it?

Why do you want to see it?

He's my best friend.

Again, why do you want to see it?

What if Nick gets into an accident?

What if he's horribly d*sfigured, and I have to identify him, and all that remains are his private parts?

And I'm standing there and I'm saying,

"Sorry, Officer, I can't help you, because no, I haven't seen his penis."

And then boom, he's buried in an unmarked grave.

Again, why do you want to see it?

What did it look like? What do you mean?

Just say when.

Just sa... serious...

Seriously? Are you s.. Are you serious?

Okay, you know what. This is impossible.

I'm starting over.

Schmidt, I need your help.

Okay... all right, Jess, fine.

What happened after you walked in?

I don't know. I kind of laughed.

Jess, you can't laugh at a naked man, especially Nick.

Nick is delicate...

like a flower.

Like a chubby, damaged flower who hates himself.

Now, listen to me. You're gonna act like this never happened.

We live together.

We're a family.

Families talk about things.

No. Families ignore things until they go away.

YOUNG SCHMIDT: Hey, Mom, hey, Mom, hey, Mom, I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!

Mom, Mom, Mom, I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!

No one wants to talk abou.

Never talk about this again.

Okay. I'll ignore it.

** Not gonna talk about...

Or sing about it.

The bing-bong. I'm done.

This is my... my chambre.

What does that mean?

You're a good kisser.

Can we, can we be serious?

Do you mind just being serious?

I'm gonna get serious... on your face.

(laughing)

I have no idea what that means.

(laughing)

Actually, let's not laugh when you're near my penis.

Take it off.

Here, just take your shirt off.

**

Can't...

Here. Do... Do you want me to go first?

You're offering just to take your...

Oh, my God!

Look at you.

Take off your clothes now.


President Obama.

Yeah, I like him to watch over me.

Do you, like, want to take it slow... or something?

This is nice. Yeah.

MAN (on video):

It's starting toven look like a triple rainbow.

(door opens)

MAN:

Oh, my God, it's full-on!

Hi, Nick.

So I guess your date went well.

Sleepover party.

I have something from school that, um... made me think of you.

It's a Feeling Stick.

Whoever's holding a Feeling Stick has permission to say whatever he or she is feeling without being judged.

I'll go first. Um...

I feel like I want to know what you're feeling.

Believe it or not, that's not the first time someone's broken my Feeling Stick.

I have a travel size.

Nick, wait!

Nick, we have to talk about this What are you doing?

I'm sorry I saw your doojer and your chickadees.

And I didn't mean to laugh. I just...

Then why did you laugh?

Is there something funny about it?

No.

It's beautiful.

Stately.

A real treat.

Oh, my God.

(whispering): I think it's great you dance naked to Jamaican music.

That's really cool.

You should explore your sexuality.

(bell dings)

Nick? Excuse me.

Come on, Nick. I dance naked all the time.

We have to talk about this.

Ugh! Nic

(sighs)

(bell dings)

Nick, please talk to me.

Jess, there's nothing to talk about.

You ruined my date.

Every time I tried to take my clothes off, Jess, I heard your little...

(imitates Jess's cackle)

Your little crazy giggle scream.

And all I want to do is have meaningless sex with a beautiful woman who, yes, talks in mind-bending riddles.

But I can't, because I can't get your little...

(screaming cackle)

out of my head.

Well, maybe you don't want to have meaningless sex.

Maybe that's not your style.

I have a bing-bong and chickadees.

It is my style.

Stop following me.

Then stop running away from me.

I just want to have a mature conversation.

How can we have a mature conversation when you can't even say the word "penis"?

I can say the word "pen..."

Say it. I...

"Peernyas."

What?

"Peernis."

You said "peernis."

** Penis. Not singing.

(deep voice):

Penis.

Not like a ghoul.

(chuckling):

I... I can say it!

Pianist. No, you said "pianist."

Enispay! Not pig Latin.

"Peernis."

Okay, not in Swedish.

"Pemo."

Not in fake Italian.

(shrieking):

Penis!

Shut up!

Say it with me... "pe... Pe...nis."

...neers.

Yeah, I'm the one that's immature.

Hey, man. Aah!

I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.

What? Just the g*n.

No. Just the roses.

What? Just the hub, where it connect Get out. Fine!

I thought we were best friends.

We are.

Apparently not.

Best friends don't do this, Schmidt.

They do it all the time.

You laughed? Yeah, I couldn't help it.

Did you freak out and make that noise that you always make?

What? I don't always make a noise.

(giggles, cackles)

Fine.

I guess I missed the moment when everybody got cool about sex.

I really messed up.

Ah, guys are simple.

You know what I would do? I would just make it even.

You've seen his; show him yours.

(sighs) No.

I can't do that.

Hey, Winston.

Oh, no. Oh, man.

The interview? Did you mess up?

No, I didn't mess up.

k*lled it. I was amazing.

At one point, I was on the outside of my body watching myself be amazing.

Well, that's a good thing, right? The woman asked me why I wanted to sell medical supplies.

I had no answer.

I've done anything but play basketball my entire life.

"Winston Bishop is an American basketball player

"who played professionally in Latvia, and he loves ducks."

Winston, did you write the part about the ducks?

I don't even like ducks that much, man.

Okay, look, man.

You got to get off Wikipedia, all right?

You're going crazy.

I was the guy who was good enough to play in Latvia.

And then one day, I don't know, man...

I just lost it.

They found another black guy.

Labak melno virietis.

Means "the better black guy."

A better melno?

You're-you're the best melno. I don't know, man.

I just don't know what comes next. You know what you do next? Come on. You're gonna get up.

Let's get up. Come on, buddy.

We're gonna get you out of the house.

We're gonna get you moving. It's gonna feel good.

Whoo! This feels good.

(out of breath):

Totally. I love it.

You know, I think I was just scared, man.

I've been playing basketball my whole entire life.

What if I was wasting my time?

Maybe I should have been figuring out my life like you.

(laughs) I don't have anything figured out.

I'm a fully-grown man with roommates.

I have a stupid job. I'm single.

My best friend won't even let me see his penis.

I mean, my whole life is a sham.

Aah!

I actually feel a lot better.

Thanks, Schmidt.

(gasping)

Winston, my legs!

Schmidt? My legs are seizing up.

Schmidt! I hate my life. I hate my...

making new discoveries.

I'm a fear-based person, apparently.

Stop it. Go. I need a...

Give me a hug, please. 911.

Ow. Ow.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm sorry about last night, Amanda.

So you're... you're, like, super into "cuddling."

No, I'm not super into cuddling.

I'm just getting out of a relationship, and I think I got nervous.

I've heard that I'm not great at talking about what I'm feeling all the time, and so I'm sorry about last night.

Honesty.

I like that.

(sighs)

(lock clicking)

NICK:

Really nice.

(Amanda chuckling)

AMANDA:

Oh, yeah?

Oh, yeah!

Okay.

(panting):

Yeah. Yeah.

Take off your pants. Take off your pants! Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Take your pants off. Yeah? You want me to take them off?

Yeah. Yeah. Take them off. Yeah, take this... Want me to?

Okay. Want me to take these off? Yeah.

Okay, lights on, pants off. Here we go. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Yeah.

NICK: Oh, I'm totally cool with this. (laughs)

Yeah.

(sighs) All right.

(chuckles)

Okay.

What are you doing?!

What is...?! Who is that?!

(screaming)

NICK:

What are you doing?!

Hi. I'm Jess.

Welcome to our home.

We live in a world with rules. We knock.

We have doors.

And we knock on those doors.

I'm sorry, Nick.

Just knock!

Nick... I...

Put that down. But we have to talk...

Nothing to talk about.

I feel that Nick is not honoring the Feeling Stick.

I feel me, too.

WINSTON:

I feel Schmidt's had a particularly bad day, and I feel that if Nick is truly Schmidt's friend, he would show Schmidt what's in his pants.

I feel supported.

What is going on with you two?

What are you doing?

I feel Nick is yelling.

Stop it!

(door slams)

Yo. I just wanted to thank you for taking me running.

Made me feel a lot better.

Now, I might not have a job or anything, but at least I can run a mile.

I mean, watching you try to run, yeah, that was just pathetic.

I needed that.

I suffer from exercise-induced asthma.

Do you suffer from exercise-induced crying?

It's a real thing, man, okay? EIA.

You know what I learned from the Internet?

We got nothing to worry about.

Everybody has their moment.

We might get a cat one day.

That cat might play the keyboard.

A bear might fall on our trampoline.

We don't need to have it figured out right now.

We just need to be patient.

Our moments will come.

Hey, man.

Let's keep bro'ing out.

(knock at door)

Come in.

Jess, you don't have to knock once you're in the room.

I worked on something for you.

All right.

Penis.

Very good.

Thank you.

Um, so did Amanda call you back?

No, I don't see Amanda calling me back.

I'm sorry. It's okay.

Maybe you were right.

Maybe I'm not ready for meaningless sex with beautiful women.

Well, you know, maybe when you are, you'll be able to show her your other penis.

Your heart penis.

Get out of my room. Okay.

Hey, um... (laughs)

when I was, um, leaving in a hurry, um, did you see...

everything?

Yup.

Even my... my gumbo pot?

Ugh. Gumbo pot? Get out.

(shower running)

Get out, Schmidt.

I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.

SCENE: Jess' room, trying on dresses whilst Nick and Schmidt are sitting on the bed waiting for her.

JESS: It's our first wedding together, so we need nicknames. Nick is 'Nicknack' or 'Mr. Suspenders'...

SCHMIDT: No nicknames, okay, your only job tonight, is to be Nick's girlfriend, okay and make sure he stays out of trouble with Caroline.

JESS: Why can't you and Winston help?

SCHMIDT: We've tried, he doesn't listen to us anymore.

FLASHBACK - Nick sitting on the floor crying about Caroline whilst Schmidt stands in the doorway trying to         comfort him.

SCHMIDT: She's not coming back. (Nick cries even harder).


NICK: He's right, I don't.

JESS: [Coming out of the closet with a hideous, yellow, floral dress] Tah dah!

SCHMIDT: No!

NICK: [Eyes wide] That is the ugliest dress I have ever seen, Jess.

SCHMIDT: I'm really gonna need you to step it up tonight, okay, when I see you I wanna be thinking who let the dirty slut out of the sluthouse?

Nick:You're the usher, so relax.

Winston: Yeah I'll be busy, that way I won't have to sit around answering a bunch of stupid questions all day, like, 'Do you have a job', 'Are you still playing basketball?' Does it look like I'm still playing overseas basketball?

Schmidt: What is the matter with you?

Winston: This is the first job I've had in like, two months, dude, and I really just want get in there and ush this wedding in the face!

Schmidt: You're gonna be great, man.

Jess: So when we do the chicken dance, I do it a little bit differently. I know that usually it goes: Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh, [realising she went wrong] duh duh duh duh duh duh duh, mmm mmm mm... But instead of the clap, I like to do a peck, because it's more realistic. [Miming the actions]

Nick: No chicken dance!

Schmidt: Okay, look, we're not trying to be mean, we just don't want you to be yourself... in any way.

Jess: Okay, suppress the Jess. Got it.

Schmidt: [To Nick] Did you use my hair gel?

Nick: Did I use your hair gel?

Schmidt: I'm not gonna be mad, just let me know if you did.

Nick: No.

Schmidt: Sure?

Nick: I used your hair gel.

Schmidt: Are you serious?

Nick: Yeah.

[Jess comes out of the closet in a pretty purple dress]

Schmidt: Who let the dirty slut out of the sluthouse?

Nick: Wow! You look great!

[Reveals prop teeth]

Jess: [speaks in a Southern American accent but inaudible]

Schmidt: NO! [Walks off]

Nick: No teeth, Jess! You can't use prop teeth! [Walks off]

Jess: Come on, guys. These are hilarious, kids love these.


ROLL TITLES - The short version


[In the foyer to the wedding, Jess, Nick, Winston and Schmidt enter and begin mooching]

Jess: Wanna know one of my beauty secrets? The only way I could fit in this dress was by wearing little girls' bicycle shorts underneath, they are tight! I will not be peeing tonight. Oh my god, bubbles.... [heads off towards the bubbles]

Nick: [heads after her clutching her arm and guiding her away] No, no, no, no, Jess, no bubbles, no bubbles, please!

Schmidt: Hoohoo, a lot of big game here tonight, yoohoohoo. [Sees Brooke] Oh, oh there's Brooke.

Jess: Who's Brooke?

Nick: He's been into her, since freshman year. She used to get drunk and pass out on our front porch. It was like having a hot, alcoholic cat.

Schmidt: I'd always leave water out for her. Okay, tonight just got real. She's go on top of the 'k*ll list'.

Jess: Is that because you're going to attempt to k*ll her by having sex with her?

Schmidt: More or less,  yeah.

Jess: Oh, Schmidt, one day you're gonna k*ll the nicest girl.

[In the garden, Jess is doing Nick's tie]

Jess: Look at my new boyfriend, so fancy in his big-boy tie.

Nick: Jess, would you please stop?

Jess: Okay, what is it with Caroline, you're like a different person?

Nick: Just focus on getting through today, please.

Jess: Okay Mr. Boy T Friend.

Nick: What did I tell ya?

Jess: Huhuh, don't be myself.

Nick: Yes.

Jess: It's what I love about our relationship, you never let me be myself.

[Winston is standing, waiting to do his job]

Man: Hey, Winston.

Winston: Hey.

Man: You're back.

Winston: Yeah.

Mam: What are you up to? Where you working at?

Winston: Here, as an usher. [Turns to a woman who is waiting to be seated] Hi, what a beautiful dress.

Jimmy: I'm surprised you noticed the dress, I was distracted by the woman inside. Jimmy Longjam, alternate usher.

Winston: Alternate usher, I mean, I'm here. I'm the usher.

Jimmy: You were late, it's called commitment. Look it up in a typewriter, old man.

Winston: What?!

Jimmy: How much money do you make?

Winston: Where is your mother?

Woman: Can somebody help me?

Jimmy and Winston: Hello, bride or groom?

Woman: Oh, thank you. [To Jimmy]

[Nick, Jess and Schmidt]

Schmidt: Oh no, no, not tonight, no! [Looks at someone]

Jess: Who is that?

Schmidt: It's Gretchen Nelson, she's a terrible person. We can't stand each other, at every wedding we end up having sex.


Flashback: Schmidt and Gretchen getting it on in the closet at some wedding with the Bridal March on in the background. Then Schmidt and Gretchen getting it on in a store cupboard at some wedding. End.


Schmidt: I mean, the sex was amazing. She's coming over.

Nick: Hey, there are those people that we know.

Jess: Oooh, what people? [Both walk off and leave Schmidt alone.]

Schmidt: [Clears his throat] Hello, Gretchen. I see you wore the pant suit again.

Gretchen: This is a new one. It's got way more stretch, in the pants.

Schmidt: That's horrible.

Gretchen: Are you ready for tonight? I'm gonna tie you down and show you pictures of my river rafting trip.

Schmidt: Oh, god, how many are there?

Gretchen: It's a two hour slide show.

Schmidt: No! Gretchen, we can't do this anymore, okay. It's not...it's not healthy, alright, please, no more.

[Sitting in their chairs, Caroline is staring at Nick with Jess]

Nick: There she is, there she is, she's right over there. She's right over here. Just be cool.

Caroline: [Coming over] Hi.

Nick: Hey, Caroline, wow! I didn't know you were gonna be here. It's good to see you.

Jess: Nicholas, you have to introduce me.

Nick: Uh, yeah, of course, er..Jess this is Caroline.

Caroline: Hi.

Jess: One more time, Caroline? [with and ee sounding i]

Caroline: Uh, Caroline.

Jess: Caroloo...Coraline?

Nick: Caroline!

Jess: Oh, kay, fancy. Well, I'm Nicholas' girlfriend, we just started dating so we're still in that honeymoon phase. I barely sleep, so much doing it.

Nick: So much doing it, it's crazy.

Jess: He's so soft, like a towel.

Caroline: Well, uh, it was nice to meet you.

Jess: It was so nice to meet you too, Carol.

Caroline: Caroline.

Jess: [Laughs] i give up.

Caroline: I guess I'll, see you later.

Nick: Sure. [To Jess] Oh my god, was she jealous? I think she was jealous. You did so good. That was remarkable.

Jess: [Puts on prop teeth] I'm just doing what ma momma learnt me.

Nick: [Holding out his hand] Gimme the teeth. [Jess drops them into his hand]


[Scene: At the bar, after the ceremony]

Schmidt: Hi, wow, Brooke. Schmidt. You used to worry my poncho, freshman year. Remember that? No? Fat Schmidt?

Brooke: Fat Schmidt! Of course! Wow, you look great.

Schmidt: You, also, sure, um, how are your classes? I mean...not that we're, not that we're in school anymore, I know that. What...what are you drinking? White wine?

Brooke: I'm not drinking. I'm sober, six months. Can I get a saltzer, please?

Schmidt: Me too.

Brooke: You're six months sober, also?

Schmidt: Seven months, one more.

Brooke: Wow! That's great! Congratulations.

Bartender: Here's your white wine.

Schmidt: What? That's a mistake, no I didn't order that. No. No, sir! [Even the smell of it...]

Brooke: I'm going back to my table, but you can come talk to me, if you need to.

Schmidt: Okay, thank you. [To bartender] So what I need you to do is this, I need you to put vodka in a water bottle, okay, and rendezvous with me in the restroom, okay? Same page, same page?


[Scene: In the venue]

Jimmy: [Laughs at Winston]

Winston: [To Nick] This kid is pushing my buttons.

Nick: Winston, he's just a little boy, relax.

Schmidt: If Brooke asks, I six months clean and sober, and looking to settle down.

Nick: Great. [To Jess] Schmidt's sober. What are you doing? [She is touching his face]

Jess: She's looking at us. [Waves at Caroline] Your head is shaped like a yam. 

Nick: Yeah I know, I can't wear soft hats. Hey, when she comes here I want to talk to her about myself.

Jess: No.

Caroline: Hi, could that ceremony have lasted any longer? [Laughs at own joke]

Jess: Hahaha. We loved it, taking notes, unless Mr. Commitment Phobe over here, decides to make an honest women out of me.

Caroline: Oh.

Nick:: Hey, Jess. Did you wanna go do that thing, for um...?

Jess: Yes, I did. I wanted to do it very badly... [Leaves]

Nick: Thank you.

DJ: And now, for the first time ever, Mr and Mrs Hammond. 

[Jess walks right into the doorway where the bride and groom are entering through]

Jess:  [Looks awkwardly around] Yay! Bride and groom! Make way! Hazaar! Celebrate love! Get ready for a wonderful life of merriment and joy.

Caroline: Jess is...great.

Nick: Yeah, the best. So happy.

Caroline: Are you guys pretty serious?

Nick: Yeah, we are pretty serious. Yeah, we live together. I mean different bedrooms but shared bathrooms, so that's something.


[Scene: Schmidt at the bar]

Schmidt: Alcohol, any kind of alcohol you have. Just gimme anything. Thank you.

Gretchen: Gimme that. 

Schmidt: Oh God. It's like you're lapping it out of a puddle.

Gretchen: Eugh, where did you get those boots? Off a lady hiker?

Schmidt: Look at those earrings. Are they clip ons?

Gretchen: [Whispers] I'm gonna make you wear them.

Scmhidt:... Huh. No!

[Jess is sitting at a table pulling at her shorts]

Jess: Is it bad that I can't feel my legs?

Schmidt: Yes, now let's talk about my problems. Jess, I have to go home with Brooke tonight. I deserve someone like Brooke, she's perfect and it doesn't matter that I have gymnastic mean spirited, highly educational sex with Gretchen, it's just, that's not what I want to do anymore, okay? Not tonight.

Jess: What's so bad about liking Gretchen, I mean you guys obviously have like a weird connection?

Schmidt: No, no, no. I wanna connect with Brooke. I wanna connect with her in the shower, on the floor, sitting Indian style.

Jess: Okay, you know what, you can keep talking but I'm gonna put my hands over my ears.

Winston: We got a problem. [They look over at Nick and Caroline talking]

Schmidt: Jess, what did you do? 

Jess: Look, they're fine. They're just talking.

Schmidt: No, not fine.

Winston: No, no, no. With Caroline, he is not fine. Okay, he ran into her at a party two months ago, then sent me a ten page email about what she meant when she said 'I'll see you soon'.

Schmidt: She will flirt with until she knows she can have him. It's like he's her back up plan.

Jess: I didn't know that.

Schmidt: You wanna live with Nick when he's not showering and crying all day?

Winston: Yeah, it sounds like this. [Imitates Nick]

Schmidt: You ever heard a grown man sob listening to Simon and Garfunkel?

Jess: Yeah, my dad.

Schmidt: Yeah.

Jess: Okay, I get it, I'll go but I just...these biker shorts are really tight...

Schmidt: [Getting her up] Come on, work through it.

Jess: Okay, okay.

Schmidt: It's all on you, Jess.

[Jess starts dancing in front of the table where Nick and Caroline are sat]

Jess: Come on in, honey. The water's fine.

Nick: Jess, you know I don't dance.

Jess: Oh, but you didn't know that I did this. [starts to mime dance] I'm mime walking, I'm Mimechael Jackson.

Nick: [Laughs nervously]

Caroline: I'm gonna get a drink.

Nick: Me too.

Jess: Nick, wait, no.

Nick: Yes, relax this is good, I may actually have a chance and it's all because of you so thank you.

Jess: No Nick, that wasn't my intention. Nick, Nick! [Jimmy comes up and starts dancing with Jess] Oh, hi. I don't feel like dancing right now, I'm sorry. I'm really uncomfortable right now.Oh Winston, thank God. Nick got away!

Winston: Nick can wait, this, this is about honesty. [Starts having a dance off with Jimmy]

DJ: And, looks like we have a dance off.

Winston: What?! [Starts grinding on Jess]

Jess: Oh my God, what are you doing?!

Jimmy: Mom! Mommy?!

Jess: Nick? Nick!?


[Scene: Later on in the after party, Schmidt approaches Brooke]

Schmidt: The chocolate fountain, it reminds me of the one in Tuscany, you ever been?

Brooke: Yeah, I was just there for New Year's, where's the chocolate fountain?

Schmidt: I don't know, I've never been, I'm just fascinated with the culture.

Jess: [From the other side of the room] Schmidt! Schmidt! I need you to help me take these off so I can go find Nick!

Brooke: God, are you friends with that girl?

Jess: Schmidt?!!

Schmidt: Look, I didn't want to have to tell you this but, she was a mistake I made when I h*t rock bottom. I was her Sid and she was my Nancy and then I got sober and she couldn't deal with it and the poor thing just went, she went crazy.

Jess: Schmidt! I need you to help me slap my thighs around!

Schmidt: I don't want to scare you, but she can be very dangerous when she drinks. Okay, I shouldn't even be in the same room as her, it's just, it feels so good talking to you. 

Brooke: Maybe we should get you out of here.

Schmidt: What a great idea, ues.

Brooke: I just have to go to the bathroom really quickly.

Schmidt: Whatever you need, whatever, yeah, of course.



[Scene: Nick and Caroline are in a photo booth]

Nick: Ready, no lips. Name one, name one.

Caroline: Do, uh, wind tunnel!

Nick: Super high drivers license.

Caroline: [Laughs] Can we stay in here all night?


[Scene: Brooke walks into the restroom and finds Jess in there]

Jess: Oh, hi! Schmidt is very fond of you.

Brooke: Um, look, I..I don't know...I don't even know him that well, okay? 

Jess: Oh! I'm just cutting off my underwear, you know, girl stuff. [Rips them off] Ahh. So tight. Well, it's been really nice chatting with you but I've gotta pretend boyfriend to hunt down, I think he's cheating on me [Brandishing a pallette Kn*fe] and don't break Schmidt's heart, or you'll have me to deal with. [Laughs]


[Scene: Nick and Caroline still in the photo booth]

Jess: [Pulls back curtain of photo booth] Aha! I trusted you!

Nick: Jess, get outta here.

Caroline: Nothing happened.

Jess: After everything we've built. 

Nick: Go away, Jess, please.

Jess: Who are you?

Caroline: No, really, nothing happened. I have a boyfriend.

Nick: Wait, you have a boyfriend?

Caroline: Yeah, well I've been seeing someone. I didn't want to bring him because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but now I know that you have Jess...

Jess: Yeah, he has me... and our baby! 

Caroline: Okay, I'm just gonna let  you guys...

Jess: And our other baby!

Schmidt: [Goes up to Jess] Jess, what happened with Brooke?

Jess: What?

Schmidt: She just left here in tears because she said that you thr*at her with a Kn*fe!?

Jess: No, I was talking you up.

Schmidt: No, you shouldn't have been talking me up, you should've been taking care of Nick. Why is it so hard to do one thing?

Jess: How is this my fault?

Schmidt: Ruiner.

Jess: Uh, did you just call me a ruiner?

Schmidt: Yeah.

Jess: Okay, you know what, forget it. I'm not helping you guys anymore. Give me my teeth back. [Goes in Nick's jacket]

Nick: Stop it, Jess.

Jess: You don't appreciate them.

Nick: Cool it!

Jess: Give them back. I'm gonna have fun, [puts in teeth] cause there's nothing wrong with who I am, and I like having fun at weddings, and I like dancing, and if you don't like that, then tough teeter tots, tooter. Jess is back. [Storms off]

Gretchen: [Walks over to Schmidt] Ah, you going home with me aren't you? [Puts the clip on earrings on him] Good boy. [Slaps his ass]


[Scene: Drunken Nick being filmed for the happy couple]

Nick: [Holds up pictures from the photo booth] That's Caroline and that's me. Four years we were together so...it doesn't matter to me, it's just what matter is..respect. [Crying] I'm just so alone right now, man and it's a real bad situation...

Camera Man: Uh, Steve and Bree.

Nick: Steve and Bree, because that's what this is about, I agree with you, you're good at your job, man. [Turning to the cardboard cut out of Steve and Bree] I'm so happy for you, you look great, it feels a little bit like you're rubbing it in my face, you know, happiness, but let's be honest, Bree, this doesn't look great on you. [Gestures to the dress] This. That's not a great look, Bree! Congratulations, Steve, nice fedora and no open bar, Steve, don't you understand that's tacky! You're dad's rich, you're a lawyer, man. [Kicks over cardboard cut out] Yeah! That happened! [Goes over to the photo booth] The photo booth is a liar, fyi. [Opens curtain] Oh, hey ladies, you guys wanna see a grown man cry? No? Then get out! I think I saw a single doctor looking at you. [To one of the women] This is gonna take a while, Orange.


[Scene: Jess. sitting at a table, bl*wing bubbles]

Jess: Hi there, partner.

Winston: [Sits down and put his feet up like Jess] Hey, can I tell you something you promise to never tell Schmidt? I love bubbles! [Laughs] I don't know why, I just always have. [Takes the bubbles and bl*ws some, laughs again] You see that, that was like two in one.

Jess: Woah.

Winston: Are you okay?

Jess: Yeah, I'm fine.

Winston: Those guys were jerks, but I know that they're glad you're around.

Jess: Really?

Winston: Yeahh, I'm just gonna come out and say it, especially Nick, but they're all thinking it. Even me. Most of the time.

Jess: [Smiles] It was weird, when I was stuck in a freak sandwich between you and that eight year old. Do you wanna talk about that?

Winston: [Sniggers] You know, it's just that he got to be a bit annoying, so.. I kinda took my feelings out with dance...? [Jess laughs]

Schmidt: Okay, er, so, we have a situation.


Scene: [Nick drunkenly talking in the photo booth to himself]

Winston: Hey, Nick.

Nick: It's mine now.

Winston: How're you doing, buddy?

Nick: They want me to leave the booth...but I'm staying. This is my home now. It's got everything that I need.

Schmidt: [Showing the pictures to Jess] You can see by looking at these pictures, that he's experiencing a variety of different emotions. This one is... well that's actually his butt. He just keeps saying, Jess.

Nick: Jess! The fact is, is I was a mean person and I'm sorry, okay?

Jess: [Pokes her head into the booth] Hi, Nicholas.

Nick: Hey, Jess. I live in a photo booth, now.

Jess: Oh, is that so?

Nick: Yup. Come on in, come on in. That's the kitchen area.

Jess: Very nice.

Nick: This is the common area.

Jess: Oh, okay.

Nick: Dining room, living room, kind of everything.

Jess: It's very nice. Hey...she had a boyfriend...

Nick: Yeah.

Jess: She shouldn't have been flirting with you all night. You can't be her back up plan. You have to let each other go. So now, you have to make a decision. Am I gonna stay locked in a photo booth for the next hour or am I gonna get out there, take my shoes off and dance my face off. [Laughs] Come on, it's up to you. [Leaves]

Nick: Oh, man, all right. [Pats the wall] I love you photo booth. [Leaves]


[Scene: Winston walks into the main room, and looks over at Nick and Caroline talking]

Winston: [Walks over to the table where Jess and Schmidt are] Yo, look at him. He looks better.

[Nick and Caroline]

Nick: I can't do this anymore. I have to let you go, Caroline, for real. It has to be over.

Caroline: [Sighs] Um... [Hugs him]

Nick: Goodbye, good luck and everything.

Caroline: Good bye.

Nick: Alright, um, I've gotta, excuse me. [Walks over to Jess, just as a song comes on] Come on, Jess.

Jess: What?

Nick: Just please? Just come with me, right now. [She gets up and they walk onto the dancefloor and face each other] [Nick starts doing a slow motion chicken dance to the music]

Jess: [Laughs and joins in]

Schmidt: You know, that looks like so much fun. [Gets up and joins in]

Winston: [Laughs and joins in too] 

Schmidt: Check out my beats.

Winston: Stop copying my beats.


[Credit Scene: Schmidt tied to Gretchen's bed]

Schmidt: Gretchen, you think that like, hooking up at all these weddings...I mean one of these times, we go on an actual date.

Gretchen: No! I'm just using you for your body.

Schmidt: Oh, okay, cool. How many more of these things?

Gretchen: We're just getting started.

Schmidt: That yellow helmet is... ugh.

Gretchen: Tonight, I'm gonna get certified on the River Schmidt.

SCHMIDT: You consider me a sexy man, correct?

JESS: I don't know how to answer that question.

SCHMIDT: Okay look, I'm meeting a girl for drinks tonight, and I'm probably going to bring her back here, for sex.

JESS: I have to get to school cause it's astronomy day and I'm dressing up like Galileo, so I have to put on my beard.

SCHMIDT: I get that, but as a lady, where in the room do I look sexiest? You know like, like where am I best on display? Here? (Sits in armchair, legs crossed holding head) Here? (Sits on arm of armchair) Or (runs over to bed) here? (lies on bed on his side) 

ENTER NICK

NICK: Hey, what is going on out here?

JESS: Um, Schmidt wants to know where in his room he looks the sexiest.

NICK: Well it's a big room. What are your choices?

SCHMIDT: Ok, I'm glad you asked. Alright, (waves hand across bed) here? (runs over and sits in armchair) Here? (sits on arm of armchair again) Or here? You know, maybe just reading a book or something.

NICK: It's a lot of options. Could you do them again really fast?

JESS: Guess I'm not the new kid anymore, I'm just one of the guys.

NICK: You're still the new kid, Winston lived here before Coach did.

JESS: (Carries on preparing breakfast) So Coach said, (sh*t of Schmidt walking by, taking earphones out) that they used to play basketball together at college, but then Winston went pro...

SCHMIDT: In Latvia, okay? He went pro in Latvia, there's a big difference. (Nick turns around to look at him) Well the team logo, is a fig. Just a.. just a one single fig.

JESS: Oh, you're jealous. (Turns around) That's so cute. (Turns back)

SCHMIDT: (Smirks) Of Winston? No no no. Look, I'm not jealous of Winston. Ok, it's been two year, he's gonna have to recognize, I'm a lot flyer now. Wanna see me flex my base? (Starts to take off shirt)

SCHMIDT: Baboom.

NICK: It's the morning.

JESS: (Whispers whilst carrying the breakfast tray) He's gonna love it.

NICK: Jess, what are you doing? (To Schmidt) What is she doing?

(Jess kicks opens the door, walks in and places the tray on the floor, loud enough to wake Winston. Winston wakes with a start.)

WINSTON: What the.. what the.. (points at Jess) who?

JESS: I'm Jess.

SCENE: Nick and Jess are in the bathroom brushing their teeth, whilst Schmidt is in the shower.

JESS: I can't believe you didn't tell me he was hungover!

NICK: I totally told you he was hungover. I said he was drunk at the bar and now he's passed out.

(ENTER WINSTON)

JESS: Hi, Winston. Hey, I apologize for what happened before... not cool, bad call. I've been talking to the guys about boundaries, so I totally get it.

WINSTON: Perfectly fine, no problem.

JESS: Do you have a t*nk top I could borrow? You look like you're about my size. It's just that I'm really low on clothes right now cause I broke up with my boyfriend. And I caught him cheating and... I just like grabbed whatever I could and...

SCHMIDT: (Steps out of the shower) Jess, you know what? I'll let you check my lost and found. It's where I keep all the things the girls leave behind in my room after we've founicate. I've got sizes 0 through 10. (Jess and Schmidt leave)

WINSTON: What have you done to me Nick?

NICK: I am so happy you're back.

SCENE: Schmidt and Jess are sitting on the bed, with a box in front of them.

JESS: (Rummaging through the box, she pulls out stiletto) You have made love to a lot of forgetful women.

SCHMIDT: (Taking shoe off her) Ah man, look at these, wow. (Sees Jess taking out hair extensions from the box) Oh, look at that, Rochechana 06. Yeah, nothing orthodox about what we did that night.

JESS: Winston seems nice...

SCHMIDT: Did he say anything to you about the room?

JESS: What room?

SCHMIDT: The big room, I kinda took it from him when he left, I used to be in the small room. (Pulls out shirt from box that says 'I AM CLAIRE'.) This happened in the small room. (Looks at it) Twice. Never going back there again, Jess.

SCENE: Winston and Nick are tossing a basketball back and forth between then in the main living area of the loft.

NICK: He's never gonna give you that room back.

Winston: Psshhhh, come on man, it's Schmidt. You know they have a saying in Latvia. 'That guy is so stupid we could easily take things away from him'.

NICK: (Laughs) That's a saying?

WINSTON: (Laughs) Yeah, it is.

NICK: That's a weird saying. (Bounces ball and throws to Winston who sh**t and scores)

ENTER JESS

JESS: (Wearing borrowed clothes) What d'ya think?

NICK: Jess, I've been telling you this for weeks but you gotta call Spencer and you gotta get your stuff back. Unless, you know, unless you're scared.

JESS: No, I'm not scared, it's just complicated. That stuff was... that stuff was ours and I miss him. (Starts to get upset.)

SCHMIDT: Jess, look, it's a ball. (Throws ball to Jess)

JESS: Oh, a little b-ball huh, (laughs). (Whilst bouncing ball) You know, I'm actually pretty good. I used to play with my mom. (Half-singing and still bouncing ball) Defense! Defense! Watch out for the defense! Sneaky sneaky wah wah.

NICK: (To Winston) You get used t`o it.

JESS: Hey, Schmidt! (Bounces ball really hard in Schmidt's general direction and smashes the TV)

NICK: Ah, come on!

JESS: (Puts hands over her face) Uh!

SCHMIDT: Wow! (Sarcastically)

JESS: (Removes hands from face) Oh! (Breathes heavily) My bad!

NICK: (Holding the bridge of his nose) Uuuuuuuuurgh.


JESS: I'm sorry, you guys.

NICK:  That was my TV, Jess.

SCHMIDT: Kinda all he had.

JESS: I'll get you a new one I just can't it afford it right now.

NICK: If ya don't mind me asking, what's the plan?

WINSTON: You don't know me like that but I need a TV.

NICK: Do you have a TV at Spencer's?

JESS: Yeah, I do, it's just really big and thin and brea...

NICK: Go get it!

JESS: No, I can't, I haven't spoken to Spencer since he cheated on me with that hoe! Actually, that's not fair, she might be a really nice hoe. I just don't wanna get in a big fight with Spencer, I want to be friends with him eventually.

NICK: Why do you wanna be friends with your ex? I don't wanna be friends with Caroline, and all she did was rip me open and tear out my heart out with her perfect, perfect hands.

JESS: He has this power over me, like he's a wizard and I'm his mage and I think it's his hair, he has like this really beautiful hair, and whenever I see it I get the 'woowoos'.

NICK: Oh my god, I hate my life!

SCHMIDT: Ok guys just.. Jess look, I know, closure, ouch, am I right?

JESS: I don't know at all what you're saying right now.

SCHMIDT: Ok Jess, think about it...

NICK: Ok Schmidt, it's not that complicated, Jess just get the TV back!

SCHMIDT: Yay.


[JESS SITTING ON A BENCH, WATCHING SPENCER RIDING TOWARDS HER ON HIS BIKE]

JESS: Hi Spencer.

SPENCER: (Takes his helmet off and shakes his hair out in slo-mo, movie style) Hi, Jess-jess.


[THE GUYS IN A CAFE, AT A TABLE, EATING BREAKFAST]

WINSTON: Wow, I miss this place. How's your yoghurt thing, Schmidt?

SCHMIDT: Oh, the parfait? It's parfait.

NICK: Come on, don't...

SCHMIDT: (To the hot waitress) Oh, hello. You look beautiful today. You look smart.

HOT WAITRESS: Stop talking to me, Schmidt.

WINSTON: So, you're making all the calls now, Schmidt?

SCHMIDT: Sure...

WINSTON: This must mean, you're the top dog?

SCHMIDT: Yeah?

WINSTON: (Exchanging glances with Nick) That's cool...

SCHMIDT: You know, i'm glad you guys think that, cause... you know I think that too.

WINSTON: One hundred percent, I mean, when I moved out, obviously there was a power vacuum. 

NICK: Yeah, I needed a leader, I didn't know which end was up.

SCHMIDT: Yeah, Nick's the bottom if you know what I mean.

NICK: Absolutely, say Winston, do all top dogs need the biggest room or, I dunno, is that knida cheesy, a little over k*ll?

WINSTON: No no no no no. Though I definitely see what you're saying though, definitely. Uh, every top dog is differt, every top dog is different. Hey, Schmidt, what uh, what kind of top dog are you?

SCHMIDT: ...the kind with the big room.


[BACK TO JESS AND SPENCER ON THE BENCH TALKING]

SPENCER: I'm so glad we're talking, last time I saw you, you were so mad.

JESS: How is, um...?

SPENCER: Rochelle.

JESS: Rochelle...fancy name.

SPENCER: She's great.

JESS: Rochelle like a mermaid.

SPENCER: Yeah.

JESS: (Puts on weird voice and picks up parts of her hair) Hello. I'm Rochelle and I eat fish.

SPENCER: Yeah, we have a lot in common, see we both love bikes...

JESS: I love bikes...

SPENCER: Not enough.

JESS: Um, Spencer. I need my stuff back. My TV, all my winter clothes.

SPENCER: Yeah, of course. I would have brought it today but I rode my bike here. You know, without the basket.

JESS: Ok. Well, when will it be a good time for me to come over...?

SPENCER: (Interrupting Jess and changing the subject) It's so good to see you Jess.

JESS: Spencer, I really need my stuff..,

SPENCER: Shuuuuuuuusshhh. I need something too.

SPENCER AND ROCHELLE:  (Singing) YOU WANT IT, YOU GOT IT, YOU WANT IT, BABY YOU GOT IT. JUST BUST A MOVE, UH. YOU WANT IT.


[JESS IN A PAWN SHOP TRYING TO BARGAIN WITH THE OWNER FOR A TV]

JESS: $550 for the TV? Seems a little steep. I'm gonna write down a figure and this is as high as I go. (Draws something on a piece of paper)

PAWN SHOP OWNER: You drew a smiley face.

JESS: I'm a teacher. Do it for the kids.

PAWN SHOP OWNER: For the kids, $550.

JESS: I can't go home without a TV, I thought pawn shops were about helping people and frankly, right now, I feel taken advantage of. I just got out of a long relationship and I don't know what I'm doing emotionally or lets be honest, sexually. (Picks up her bag to go) I'll just, I'll just get out of here. (Tries to steal the TV but fails miserably.)

PAWN SHOP OWNER: Are you trying to rob me?


[BACK IN THE LOFT, NICK IS WATCHING TV ON HIS PHONE]

SCHMIDT: Hey, where's Winston, MM?

NICK: Yeah, I think he's in his room, Schmidt.

SCHMIDT: (Sits down) Do you really think I'm top dog?

NICK: Yes

SCHMIDT: Do you think I'm head baller, sh*t caller? 

NICK: Yes Schmidt, I feel that way.

SCHMIDT: (Moves next to Nick) You see that man? It's my new thumb ring. Hot choice is that. Little skull. It's so nectar.

NICK: Did you just make up nectar?

SCHMIDT: Nah, it's a volleyball term. What is Winston doing in there? He can't hang out in there, it's too small.

[ENTER JESS AND CECE]

NICK: What's up?

SCHMIDT: Yo, what up, Cec?

NICK: You alright?

JESS: I'm sorry, I didn't get the TV.

SCHMIDT: What happened?

CECE: Urgh, terrible roommates. I mean seriously, you guys told her to call Spencer? That is not your job, that is my job!

NICK: Alright, so what happened?

JESS: Urgh, he needed a ride to the airport.

NICK: What?!

JESS: For his new girlfriend.

NICK: Are you kidding me?!

SCHMIDT: Are you serious?

CECE: What? You didn't tell me that!

JESS: And, I'm supposed to pick her up next Sunday.

NICK: OMG Jess!

SCHMIDT: Wow.

JESS: What's wrong with me?

NICK: I figured it out. This guy is your kryptonite. You need to stand up and you need to fight him.

JESS: I want to fight him but I can't. I'm powerless.

NICK: Cause you're not ready to let him go. I think you know, deep down, once you get your stuff back, you know, it's over over.

CECE: I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, but, I agree with him.

JESS: No, you guys are wrong. I really, I really wanna move on.

NICK: Then you gotta fight.

JESS: Alright, I wanna fight.

NICK: Then get mad!

JESS: I wanna get mad!

NICK: (Stands up and pick up cushion from sofa) Alright, then do this. Pretend this is Spencer's face. Punch it. (Jess prepares herself for a showdown with the cushion) Get. (Punches cushion) Come on, do it again. (Punches a little harder) Alright, punch it like a man. (Punches a little harder.) Harder than that! (Punches harder) 

CECE: Come on, Jess.

NICK: Come on Jess, get angry. (Punch) Good!

CECE: (Punch) Get angry. (Punch) Get real angry.

NICK: (Starts punch dancing) That's dancing. That's punch dancing. He broke your heart! He did terrible things to you, you hate him.

JESS: (Still punching) I'm mad!

NICK: Good.

CECE: There you go.

NICK: Good.

JESS: I'm bad!

NICK: You're ready, go get your stuff.

JESS: (Starts walking towards the door) I'm gonna go get my stuff!

NICK: Go get it.

SCHMIDT: Go on, Jess.

JESS: I'm really mad!

NICK: I'm proud of you.

JESS: I'm gonna go get it!

NICK: Go get your stuff.

JESS: I'm gonna face the facts! I'm gonna ask you guys, right now, to come with me. Seriously guys, cause I can't everything alone and I can't be alone.



[THE WHOLE g*ng ARE IN THE CAR WITH JESS AT THE WHEEL TO GO GET JESS' STUFF. SHE IS DRIVING REALLY FAST AND HAD VERY LOUD MUSIC ON IN THE CAR.]

JESS: Yeah! Loud music! Loud. Loud. Loud.

WINSTON: Ok, you're ruining my pre-game mence.

JESS: What am I gonna say?

NICK: Hey Spencer, give me my TV back.

JESS: Hi Spencer, give me my TV back, buddy.

NICK: Hey, no buddy. How about jerk or idiot.

JESS: Mr. Crabs.

WINSTON: Mr. Crabs is an option.

CECE: (To Schmidt) Your hand is on my leg.

SCHMIDT: Your hand's on my leg.

CECE: No, it really isn't.

SCHMIDT: Classic he said, she said.

CECE: Ok, Jess, just pull over right here. (Jess almost stops but at the last second steps on the gas again and drives off) Woah!

JESS: Ok, you know what, just one more sh*t.

NICK: Ok, one more time around Jess, and then we're good. You got this.

JESS: Yeah. (Tries to pull up again but carries on driving again)

SCHMIDT: Really? Come on.

JESS: Just one more time, gonna... (breathes) 

NICK: Alright, this is the time, this is the time. Wow.

CECE: Woah!

JESS: Ok one more sh*t, one more sh*t, just one more, just one more.

SCHMIDT: (To Winston) You know I'm onto you.

WINSTON: What do you mean?

SCHMIDT: You told me that I'm top dog but secretly you think that you're top dog. Alright, now you are just trying to out top dog the top dog.

CECE: Jess, can you please take these doors off child lock so I can k*ll myself.

SCHMIDT: Men are working. Look things are different now man, you're not top dog anymore. I am.

WINSTON: Okay, you know what you are absolutely correct you are the top dog. (Puts hand up to head as if taking off imaginary crown) Here. (Puts it on Schmidt)

SCHMIDT: (Taking off the imaginary crown) What are you doing? There is no top dog crown. Are you trying to make me look stupid. Look man, this is about respect, I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.

WINSTON: Yeah, much flyer, I respect you Schmidt.

SCHMIDT: No, you don't because if you had, you would have told me that the (song changes to a more calm love song) small room is the top dog room. (Jess begins to slow down)

JESS: (Singing along)

WINSTON: What? I own this song.

JESS: (Still singing) YOU GO AND SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST (Finally pulls up out side Spencer's house)

SCHMIDT: What's happening?

WINSTON: What's happening if that is a great song.

JESS: (Gets out of car and walks towards the house)

CECE: I'll be out here if you need me, Jess. (Jess rings the doorbell continuously until it opens)

SPENCER: Hi, Jess-jess.

NICK: That's the wizard? He's wearing a scrunchie.

WINSTON: It looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.

CECE: Yeah, like he'd ever have a job.

SCHMIDT: Didn't you just kinda assume he'd have a handlebar moustache.

NICK: Come on Jess, just go in there and get that TV.

SPENCER: (Pulls Jess into a hug) I missed you Jess.

CECE: Don't hug him back... (Jess hugs him back) ALL IN CAR GROAN

SCHMIDT: Ugh. That's not healthy.

JESS: (Notices withered plants) I told you to water the plants! (Pulls away from hug)

SPENCER: Huh? Oh, you know that's not my thing. (Tries to hug her back but she pushes him away)

JESS: I told you to water the plants. (Pick up flowerpot and throws it onto the lawn, smashing) ARRRRGGGHHHH!

NICK: What is she doing?

ALL: OHHH!!

SCHMIDT: What a mess.

JESS: ARGGGHHHH! I'M GOING IN!! (Runs into house)

SPENCER: Jess, take your shoes off, we keep an Asian household. (Runs after her)

WINSTON: Didn't see that coming.

NICK: Is she gonna be ok in there?

[A LOT OF CRASHING AND BANGING]

SPENCER: Cece! Hi.

CECE: (Walking towards the house) I gotta go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess.

SPENCER: (To Cece) Hey. (To Jess) Let's just talk about this, okay, rap it out.

JESS: No! We can't rap it out, we're not together anymore, it's not the same.

SPENCER: Doesn't mean we can't talk about things.

JESS: There's nothing to talk about. Give me my shirt back.

SPENCER: No, you gave this to me, I want to keep it.

NICK: Give her, her t-shirt, man.

SPENCER: No, I don't want to, you know and I gave her this hat too so I'm going to take it back. (Bends down to reach for a red hat)

NICK: You mean this one? (Picks it up and waves it in front of Spencer)

SPENCER: Yeah. (Reaches for hat)

NICK: You want that? (Carries on waving it)

SPENCER: Yeah.

NICK: (Puts on hat) Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal. (Long pause whilst they all glare at Spencer) I dare you!

SCHMIDT: (Walks over and outs another hat on)

WINSTON: You guys looks ridiculous. (Smirks)

NICK: Look dude, give her the shirt back, (motions at shirt) I bet she worked hard on that 'JAM-boree'.

JESS: Yeah. Play on words. Jam. Boree. Jam!

NICK AND SCHMIDT: Jam!

SCHMIDT: We all made a lot of jam, Spence. You know how time consuming that can be? You need a jar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit; strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe...

NICK: No more fruit.

SPENCER: You live with these people Jess?! Seriously?! You can stay here until you can find a better place to live.

NICK: You know what, I don't like you stretch. I don't like anything about you. And I'm not afraid to...

JESS: (Touches Nicks shoulder, to Nick) I got this. (To Spencer) I've got a place to live, Spence. It's over. I spent six year trying to figure you out. All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair. I'm happy you cheated on me, thank you. Because if you hadn't, I would have ended up marrying you and then you would have hurt me all over again. (Sigh) And yeah, I was scared to start over, I didn't know what to do. And yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the internet. And yeah, stranger danger is real, but I love these guys, I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them. All of them!

GUYS: Just take it easy on the love stuff...

WINSTON: (Bends down to pick up a hat) Give her the shirt back, man. (Puts hat on)

SPENCER: What happens if I say no?

SCHMIDT: You know what happens? Schmidt happens! (Slaps Spencer)

SPENCER: Ow. What's on your hand?

SCHMIDT: Thumb ring, bitch! You got some Schmidt on your face!

CECE: (Walks out with some more of her stuff, including her bike)

SPENCER: You know what, fine, here, take it. (Takes off shirt)

CECE: (Walks by him) Keep the bell. (Chucks bell at him)

SPENCER: You know, I thought we were going to handle this like adults, Jess.

JESS: Yeah well, I though you were the love of my life, so... (sh*t of the guys watching her from in front of the car with her stuff) Suck it, Mr. Crabs! (Walks back to the car where they all pat her on the back)


[WINSTON AND SCHMIDT CARRYING SOME OF JESS' STUFF AND WALKING THROUGH THE BUILDING]

WINSTON: I do hate that guy.

SCHMIDT: (Shrugs shoulders) Whatevs, you know.

WINSTON: (Laughs) You know what? Maybe I didn't have respect for you before, because, if this is what respecting you feels like, this is definitely not how I felt. (Stops in Jess' room and start putting stuff down)

SCHMIDT: So you recognize? Represent, what.

WINSTON: Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest, I've been messing with you, but it's just that I wanted my old room back. You know, you're right, I've been away a long time and things have changed around here so I kind of got to get used to that. Keep the big room.

SCHMIDT: So now you're just deep dogging me, man. I'm not scared of your mind games, I'm taking the small room, Winston.

WINSTON: Schmidt, that's not what I mean...

SCHMIDT: No no no no no. Why don't you listen to me. You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home. I'm not falling for it. What do you take me for? Some kind of idiot?

WINSTON: (Behind Schmidt's back - a  yeah! action.)


EVERYONE IS IN THE LIVING ROOM, NICK IS TRYING TO TAPE UP THE TV

JESS: I can't believe I got all my stuff back.

NICK: You did, but most of it's broken.

JESS: Yeah it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine.

NICK: Yeah, but it's broken. (TV makes a beep sound) Hey! Look at that.

JESS: Oh my God.

NICK: I think it's working.

JESS: Oh my God!

NICK: We got a TV again. (High fives her)

JESS: It's a TV and it's working.

NICK: Hey, we got the TV back. (Sits down with Jess) Alright. (Winston comes and sits down)

JESS: You guys are awesome. I'm gonna make you so much jam.

NICK: Please don't. (Schmidt sits down)

JESS: We're gonna have a jam sess.

NICK: Absolutely not. (TV falls to the side and they all turn their heads) Okay, what are we watching?

JESS: I have some DVDs. Um, Adventures of Babysitting, Prancer, Noosies, Curly Sue.

WINSTON: I'm going out. (All the guys get up)

JESS: Wait, where are you guys going? These are heart-warming films.

SCHMIDT: (Comes running back in) Curly Sue, let's do this.

JESS: Alright, lemme go get it.

 SCENE: The apartment, a close up of Jess, sat on a sofa facing Nick, Schmidt and Coach.

JESS: So, you know in horror movies when the girl's like "Oh my god, there's something in the basement. Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on in the dark", and you're like "what is your problem? Call the police", and she's like "okay" but it's too late because she's already getting m*rder. Well, er, my story's kind of like that.

FLASHBACK - "Two Weeks Ago" - Jess is in a taxi, on the phone to Cece, her best friend.

JESS: It's a surprise for Spencer. I'm just gonna walk in and I'm gonna drop my coat on the ground. He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold, and he's helping me put myself through college.

CECE: He didn't say the college part, did he?

JESS: Um, no, I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character.

CECE: Really? What's your stripper name?

JESS: Uh... Rebecca Johnson?

CECE: Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson?

JESS: Boobies Johnson. Two-boobs Johnson.

CECE: Look at you, in the back of a cab, totally naked. I am so proud of you.

SCENE: Spencer's House - Jess enters through the front door, wearing nothing but a coat.

JESS: Hellooo? I came home early.

SPENCER: (Steps out of a room, surprised, wearing nothing but his underwear.) Jess. What-

JESS: Who's Jess? You're talking to...Tiger Boobs. (Jess takes off her coat and drops it on the ground, now completely naked.)

SPENCER: Oh...

JESS: (Jess picks up a pillow, covers herself and starts dancing seductively a bit and sings a little stripper tune.) (Singing) I'm doing sexy things (starts trotting to the side) with the pillow.

SPENCER: This-

JESS: (While shaking a plant, singing) I''m doing sexy stuff to the plant right here... (The plant falls over, making a mess.)

SPENCER: Woah, okay.

JESS: (Singing) I'll pick that up later.

JESS: (Turns around, singing) Who's that girl? (Louder) Who's that girl? (Spins back around) It's Jess!

(Another girl stands by Spencer in her underwear)

SPENCER: Um...

(Jess stands and stares in absolute shock.)

Close up of a ribbon dropping to the floor that was previously covering Jess' lady parts.

Flashback End.
 

SCENE: Back in the apartment.

JESS: So, that happened. That's why I need a new apartment. I'm sorry, what was the question again?

(We now see Nick, Schmidt and Coach sat opposite Jess on the other sofa. They're all staring at her, speechless.)

NICK: Do you have any pets?

OPENING CREDITS

SCENE: Everyone remains where they were before the opening credit.

JESS: You know what's funny? When I saw your ad on Craigslist, I thought you were women.

SCHMIDT: (Nick, Schmidt and Coach laugh and joke a bit, Schmidt suddenly turns serious) Why would you think that? That's crazy. I mean, what-

NICK: Schmidt wrote the ad.

JESS: Oh. I guess it was something about the words you used. It was like, er, like "sun-soaked" and "beigey".

NICK: (Nick and Coach laugh more, Schmidt takes off his top) What are you doing?

COACH: Wow.

SCHMIDT: What about these? These look beigey to you?

NICK: I'm sorry.

COACH: I'm his trainer so, er, it's kind of the house that coach built right here. (Coach slaps Schmidt's abs and rubs them a bit)

NICK: What are we looking at here? That's baby smooth.

SCHMIDT: This is LLS. Ladies Love Schmidt.

COACH: What!? What did you just say? Go put a dollar in the jar right now. (There is a jar sat on a table with the label "DOUCHEBAG JAR")

SCHMIDT: Are you serious?

COACH: Yeah! Now.

SCHMIDT: Dammit. (He gets up and walks out of sh*t, putting a dollar in the douchebag jar on his way)

NICK: LLS, what is wrong with you?

JESS: (Now standing) This place is beautiful. It gets so much light. Spencer hated light. It's hard to say his name.

SCHMIDT: It's okay. Nick knows. He got dumped.

NICK: (Sniggering) Dumped. Yeah, I got dumped.

   FLASHBACK - A restaurant, Nick and his ex-girlfriend, Caroline are sat at a table.

NICK: (With hands over his hears, shouting over Caroline) I can't hear you, that means we're not breaking up! We can't break up if I can't hear you! No! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!

CAROLINE: (While Nick is shouting) I need a break. Yes, we're breaking up. I'm breaking up with you. I need some time away-

 END FLASHBACK - Back in the apartment

NICK: Yeah, I got dumped. She dumped. And I'm over it. Okay, it was six months ago, guys. Get past it. I don't even know why we're still talking about it. Why's everybody looking at me? (He puts his head in his hands. Suddenly Nick, Schmidt and Coach approach Jess, who is in the kitchen now, they stand on the opposite side of a counter)

JESS: You know what, I want to live here.

NICK: Actually, I still have some questions. I mean, like, no offence but we barely know ya.

JESS: Yeah, okay, yeah. So, um, full disclosure, I'm kind of emotional right now 'cause of the break-up so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least 6 or 7 times... a day.

(Coach shakes his head slightly, looks and is disgusted)

JESS: Um, I'm a teacher so I bring home a lot of popsicle sticks, stuff like that. Also, I like to sing to myself - a lot. (Singing) A lot... I'm tired of living with my friend. She's a model. All her friends are models.

SCHMIDT: (Excited) Er, how soon can you move in?

NICK: Actually, Schmidt, slow down.

COACH: Not happening.

SCHMIDT: Okay, um, can you give us a second? I've just gotta.. (Thumping his chest) I gotta talk to my boys.

NICK: "My boys" is not a thing in here.

SCHMIDT: My bros.

NICK: Okay, Douchebag Jar.

SCHMIDT: Come on, you're my bros.

TIME JUMP - The apartment - Nick, Schmidt and Coach are in the bathroom talking.

SCHMIDT: I'm gonna say yes. Her friends are models. Okay, you guys? Models.

COACH: I say no. I need to be able to come home from work, sit on my couch, and let my beans out. Let 'em breathe.

SCHMIDT: Nick, it's all you, buddy.

NICK: Well, first, let me say I think you guys make some really interesting points. Points that I respect, but I will say this. I have lived with a woman, Caroline, as you guys know, and so I know that there are pros and I know that there are real cons, guys.

COACH: Nick, you're weak!

NICK: Okay, Pros: they smell nice. Cons: every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why. They'll ruin your life if you let 'em, they'll break down your will to live. Pros: they're really good at folding.

COACH: Make a decision!

NICK: I'm sorry, you know what? But, like, another pro, like when you-

SCHMIDT: Don't do it, put it down.

Coach: Don't.

NICK: I got it. (Puts a hood on and slowly pulls it over his face)

SCHMIDT: Don't hood me. Please don't hood me. Okay.

NICK: I know what I'm talking about.

COACH: We pushed him too hard.

SCHMIDT: We did push him too hard. How about this? Executive decision, she's in.

JESS: (Out of sh*t) Yay, I'm in! (Schmidt walks over and opens the bathroom door. Jess is stood there.)

JESS: You are not gonna regret this.

TIME JUMP - The apartment - Jess sits alone on the floor watching Dirty Dancing, crying her eyes out, she is surrounded by used tissues and wrappers. Nick, Schmidt and Coach stare from a difference.

NICK: What have you done, Schmidt?  (Coach stares at Schmidt, who shrugs like whaaat?)

SCENE: The apartment - Jess lies on a sofa watching Dirty Dancing, it's still quite messy around her, she's on the phone to her mother.

JESS: I gotta go, mom. No, I'm not watching Dirty Dancing. (Nick enters.)

JESS: No, I don't think so. (To Nick) Hey, are you gonna m*rder me 'cause you're a stranger I met on the internet?

NICK: Yes, I am.

JESS: He says no.  

(Schmidt and Coach enter, they've been working out.)

JESS: No, look, I gotta go, okay? Alright, love you. Bye.

SCHMIDT: So the Wild West party's on Saturday. I'm trying to get us in but you may need to call Caroline.

NICK: (Quickly) I'm not calling Caroline.

SCHMIDT: Hear me out.

(Nick shushes Schmidt and puts his hand on Schmidt's mouth.)

JESS: (Singing along with Dirty Dancing) ... had the time of my life.

NICK: (Pointing at Jess) We are in this situation because of you.

JESS: (Jess begins punching the sofa/pillows in the background) I hate your face, Spencer, I love you!

NICK: It has been a week of this madness. I am going crazy, Schmidt, I can't take it.

COACH: You know what? I got this. (He walks over to Jess and sits on the coffee table opposite her)

JESS: Hi, Coach.

COACH: (Firmly) Stop it. Stop!

(Jess starts wailing even louder than before)

COACH: Schmidt!

SCHMIDT: Okay. Alright. I got us into this, I'm gonna get us out. Jess, I'm gonna take the remote. (TV turning off sound) Alright. Alright, hey, Jess. (Jess just points at the TV) How you doing? (Jess shrugs like 'put the tv back on')  You look fantastic. Listen, what if you came out with us tonight? You know after work. You know, we'll fix you up, we'll take you out. We'll get you a rebound.

JESS: A rebound?

SCHMIDT: Yeah.

JESS: I don't know if I'm ready.

SCHMIDT: You're totally ready for it, I'll take you through the whole thing. You know, I'll be like your guide!

JESS: Like Gandalf through Middle-earth?

SCHMIDT: Probably not like...okay, first of all, let's take the Lord of the Rings references, let's put 'em in a deep, dark cave, okay, where no one's gonna find them, ever.

JESS: Except Smeagol, (whispering) he lives in a cave.

SCHMIDT: You know what, Jess? Come on. Let's just take the head off the couch. Come on. Sit up, girl. (Jess sits up straight) Look at that, doesn't that feel good? There we go.

JESS: I think that sounds nice. (Singing) She's going out to find a rebound. Who's that girl? It's Jess!

NICK: Wait, did you just make up a theme song for yourself?

SCHMIDT: (After some hesitation) I'm a...I'm a fix it.

SCENE: Schmidt dressed in a suit is chasing Nick down the corridor of the apartment.

NICK: I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party. (Nick is walking down the corridor with a towel over his shoulder Schmidt following behind.)

SCHMIDT: This party is everything to me, please Nick. We go every year, you have no idea what I'm going through at work. 

 FLASHBACK - Schmidt in a meeting room, addressing a table of women.

SCHMIDT: (Shouting over the noise of protesting women) I am just trying to do my work. I'm just trying to do a good job, here. 

WOMAN: Nice tie, can I borrow a tampon? (Teasingly, laughter in the background.)

FLASHBACK END - Schmidt shudders at the memory. Nick and Schmidt are in the bathroom, whilst Jess is in the shower. 

NICK: Schmidt, I'm not calling her. 

SCHMIDT: Listen to me, knowing every year that I will be going to the Waa Waa West Charity Auction for poverty reminds me that I'm still a man, and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the ChiriquÃ­ nation, which is not r*cist because it is for a good cause. 

JESS: (From inside the shower) Somebody's in here. 

SCHMIDT: We're leaving in ten minutes, did you shave your legs? 

JESS: I will now. 

SCHMIDT: Front and backs? 

JESS: Yes. 

SCHMIDT: Thank you.

NICK: (Quietly) Ok, I'm gonna k*ll myself now. 

SCHMIDT: Just call Caroline, you call her all the time when you're drunk. 

NICK: (Feigning innocence) I don't know to what you are referring. 

FLASHBACK - A drunk Nick is on the sofa with a beer on the phone, leaving a drunken voicemail on her            phone 

NICK: (In a very bad British accent, swigging beer) Hello, Caroline. I still love you, so much. (Starts to sob) So, much. (Puts his head in his hands.) 
 

FLASHBACK END - In the bathroom 

NICK: I'm not calling her. 

JESS: (Pulls back shower curtain and gets out, wearing a bright pink swimsuit) Schmidt, I know you really want to go to this party, but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat, then maybe if you're super lucky, you find a girl who'll motorboat you right back. 

NICK: (Smirking) I don't think she knows what motorboating is.

 SCENE: Jess's bedroom - with the door open. Jess is wearing a blue robe, whilst staring at her clothe-              scattered bed, deciding what to wear.

SCHMIDT: (From another room) Jess, we are leaving in five.

COACH: (Walks in to the room with a basketball) Hey.

JESS: (Holding a curling iron in her hair, turns around) Hey Coach, wha-- 

COACH: (Smashes an ornament with his basketball) Sorry. Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous... 

FLASHBACK - Coach in a gym, with a women who is on an exercise bike, she is upset because he is                shouting at her. 

COACH: SPIN WOMAN, SPIN! AHHHHHHH!

WOMAN: I'm spinning! You are so mean! (Sobbing)

COACH: I'M NOT MEAN, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU! I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

FLASHBACK END - Back in Jess's room

COACH: So I was wondering if you could, uh, help me out with that.

JESS: Sure, sure. Absolutely. (Sits down on the edge of her bed) Um, well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about, you know, like, use me for practice.

COACH: Alright, uh, um, (clears throat) shopping, is that fun for you guys?

JESS: Yeah, shopping's fun. Uh, the other day I bought a pair of jeggings, they look like jeans but they're really leggings.

COACH: Uh, uh, you-, I-. Who cares!? Sorry.

JESS: (Nods) Uhm, good job. Uh, a couple of things you could work on, uh 1. Lowering your voice.

COACH: Right on.

JESS: Uhm, 2. Listening. (Her hair begins to smoke) 3. Rage. (Smokes a bit more.)

COACH: Absolutely.

JESS: Uhm, 4.--

COACH: Your hair is on f*re. (She frowns at him and then glances to the side.)

      SCENE: In the bar, where Nick works as a bartender. He is serving the g*ng drink whilst they are at a                           table. 

NICK: Beers, and a rose.

JESS: Pink wines makes me, slutty. (A 'cute' guy walks by)

JESS: Woah, cute guy alert. (does silly stuff with her glasses whilst making noises whilst Schmidt shakes his head and Coach and Nick glance at each other)

SCHMIDT: Okay, Jess, gametime. Let's do this. If you wanna forget about Spencer (she nods) you're gonna have to do some very very bad things, (points) with that man, right over there.

JESS: (glances to look at the man) How bad?

SCHMIDT: Real bad, Jess. Real bad.

JESS: Like a, make-out sess, no tops?

SCHMIDT: (Losing the will) Okay, this is what- this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile. (she smiles a little creepily) But, you're not gonna smile like that. (Pulls a weird kind of rabbit/chipmunk smile) That looks like a, hungry badger. Pulls the same face but tries to smile as well)

COACH: Stop that.

JESS: Okay, I got this, I got this.

SCHMIDT: You got this. You got it. Just go make it out.

COACH: Get 'em up! Ride 'em out! Go do it. Ride 'em out! Huhah! (they both stand watching as she walks up to the man)

JESS: (Walks up to the side of him, pulls a pose with her hands on her hips and leans over) Hey, sailor. (He glances at her, and then looks back away)

COACH: Oh. Alright.

SCHMIDT: Alright.

COACH: That's okay. Maybe he didn't hear that.

SCHMIDT: You can come back from that.

COACH: Maybe he didn't hear that.

SCHMIDT: It's all good.

BENJAMIN: (Noticing it was Schmidt) HOLY SCHMIDT, IT'S SCHMIDT! (Walks towards Schmidt)

SCHMIDT: Oh, it is all about the Benjamin! Wassup?! (Share a man hug) Alright, P-Funk, what's up dude? This is Coach.

BENJAMIN: What's up Coach? (Falters when Coach doesn't reply) You like parties?

COACH: Don't talk to me. (Walks away)

BENJAMIN: Yeah, okay.

SCHMIDT: You know who likes to party hard, right?

BENJAMIN: Yeah, so you coming on Saturday, I here there's gonna be some fine ladies there?

SCHMIDT: Uh, maybe, yeah. I heard it's not gonna be that good this year. No?

BENJAMIN: Are you not on the list?

SCHMIDT: Man, I'm on the list, you know that.

BENJAMIN: Ohhh. That sucks man. Keep your head up, alright?

SCHMIDT: Alright, player. Do your thing man, it was good seeing you. Alright, man, P-Funk, always. (Walks over to the bar where, Coach, Nick and Jess are) Nick, please.

NICK: (Leaning over the bar) Why are you friends with those guys?

SCHMIDT: Nick, please get me in the party, I'm begging you, please.

NICK: No, I'm not calling Caroline.

SCHMIDT: Do you know what a cute cowboy I am? Do you have any idea? (Coach gets up and leaves)

SCENE: At the bar, Jess is sitting, eating a meal with a glass of wine, talking to Nick who is working at the         bar.

JESS: Well, I guess I can't hide my crazy. 

NICK: I don't think you're trying that hard.

JESS: Well, I've never been, great at this stuff, so... (bites on a celery stick)

FLASHBACK - At someone's home, young Jess is sitting on a chair playing her guitar and singing to a small      group of people at a party.

JESS: (Singing) What if God was one of us?

BOY: God, make it stop! (Puts his hands over his ears)

JESS: (Singing) Just a slob like one of us?

END OF FLASHBACK - At the bar, with Nick and Jess

JESS: Looks at us, couple of losers, we both got dumped, jeesh.

NICK: (Shaking his head) I'm fine. Six months ago so...

JESS: Do you know why she dumped you? I mean she must've hurt you pretty bad..

NICK: No, no, it made no difference to me, I just wanted to set her trash cans on f*re.

JESS: So are you always just like wondering, like, what was it, was there something I could've done differently? (he shakes his head) Do you know what happens to people who keep it all inside? They get old, and they get sad and they get weird and then you're the old man yelling at the kids who are running across your yard and you're telling them 'Don't run across my yard, my life's full of regret'. You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.

NICK: Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess, and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.

JESS: Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.

NICK: No, I was being mean, I'm not gonna do that, Jess.

JESS: Why not?! It's fun!

NICK: Because I have a penis, Jess.

JESS: (Singing in an old man's voice) My name is Nick, I have a penis and I'm not gonna let any feelings out.

NICK: (Leaning forward) Okay Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.

JESS: Yeah, I know.

PETER: (P-FUNK) Hey, I'm Peter. What are you drinking?

JESS: Oh, I'll have another pink wine. (Nick begins to walk away, taking out his phone)

PETER: I like your glasses,

JESS: They help me see.


SCENE: At a table, Jess and Peter are chatting and laughing, being observed by Schmidt and Coach.

COACH: She's doing alright.

BENJAMIN: (Walking up to Schmidt and Coach) Schmidt stain! Hey man. I was thinking that it's probably best that you don't come to the party, that means more breast for me. (Laughs)

SCHMIDT: (Standing up) You better step down son, you're taking this whole thing too far. Hold me back Coach, I'm seri-. Hold me back. Hold me back! Coach, would you please hold me back.

NICK: (Walking up to him from the other side of the bar) Schmidt, we're going to the party, relax. 

BENJAMIN: Nice, see you there Schmidtty! (Walks away)

SCHMIDT: Ah, totally, Broseph.

NICK: Yeah I texted Caroline.

COACH: You text Caroline?

NICK: (Nods) It's no big deal, it's behind me. It's in the past so..

SCHMIDT: Thank you, I love you, (hugs him) very, very much.

NICK: Yeah...Did you just kiss my arm a little?

SCHMIDT: Yeah I did, it felt right.

PETER: (Walking with Jess) So I'll see you tomorrow, sailor. (Walks away)

JESS: Yeah, cool. I'll call--, cool.

NICK: So what's happening tomorrow, sailor?

JESS: You know what, you guys were totally right. I talked in short sentences, I didn't sing, I laughed, I smiled, I said I needed rebound sex and it totally worked. He asked me out. Dinner, with food. Oooh oooh.

SCHMIDT: I'm so proud of you. (Hugs her)

COACH: You got it girl.

SCHMIDT: You did good.

COACH: You got it down. (High fives her)

JESS: (With her hands in the air) It's Jess, she's on (sings) fiiiirrreee! (Backs away at the same time, starts dancing and all the guys groan because as she turns, they notice her top is tucked in her panties)

COACH: Big ass panties.

NICK: Alright, shall we tell her?

SCHMIDT: I'll think we'll let her have her moment.

 SCENE: At the apartment, Cece is sitting on the couch in a low cut dress, with all the guys staring at her,           whilst she waits for Jess.

CECE: Do the shoes fit , Jess?

JESS: (Hears a thump) I'm okay!

COACH: What are you, a model or something?

CECE: Yeah. Yes. Mostly print right now... so.

SCHMIDT: What is it? Cece? Cecelia? Chechelia? Tell me what are your hopes and dreams? Are you warm? I'm a little, huh, I'm a little warm right now. (Begins to take off his t-shirt)

NICK: Don't, Schmidt.

COACH: All right.

SCHMIDT: (Finishes taking off his shirt) Oh yeah. There it is. (Breathes deeply an flexes)

CECE: (Unfazed) Please put your shirt back on. Please don't make me laugh at you.

SCHMIDT: Can I h*t you up with some tea? A little herb tea? Ahhh. Oh my God. How good is that, for real, whaat? A little Peaman tea? Yum, right? Hot, sweet, a little teabag action. And I wasn't, I wasn't talking about...

NICK: (Reaching over to grab the douchebag jar) There it is. Douchebag.

CECE: Listen to me you guys, Jess is by far the best person that I know, so if you guys let anything happen to her, I'm gonna come here, and crazy m*rder you.

SCHMIDT: I'm gonna be honest with you. I did not hear a word you just said 'cause I can kinda see your party hats right now.

NICK: (Reaching over for the jar again) Here we go.

CECE: Jess! (Gets up and walks off)

NICK: (Schmidt deposits another dollar into the douchebag jar) Why are you talking like this?

  SCENE: Opening Jess' door, Cece sees Jess, sprawled on the floor.

JESS: I fell off my heels.

CECE: Okay. Alright. No. Come on. (Kneels to pull Jess up) Get up.

JESS: Oh, what am I doing? I can't go on a date, what if it's horrible, what if I have nothing to talk about?

CECE: Then you go to the bathroom and you call me and you tell me all about it.

JESS: Maybe I just shouldn't go.

CECE: Babe, you got hurt, that doesn't mean you stop trying. Okay?

JESS: (Mumbles something and nods)

CECE: Okay. Let's go, come on. (Both stand up and look at what she's wearing) You gotta take off those overalls.

JESS: I was going for, like a, like a hot farmer's daughter kinda thing, you know like. (Puts on a voice) Oh, I'm to go milk my cows, with my bucket.

CECE: Take 'em off.

JESS: Okay, what am I going to wear?

SCENE: All the guys are sitting doing things when Cece walks out in Jess's overalls with a proud smile on her face. Nick looks up and Cece motions for Jess to appear.

COACH: (Jess walks out and gets Coach and Schmidt's attention.) Wow! 

JESS: (Nick smiles, Jess smiles) Thanks, Coach. (Then she starts doing a rave dance with rave music.)

SCHMIDT: And then she does that.

JESS: I'm gonna text him, tell him I'm heading over.

NICK: Wait, have you been texting him? 

JESS: Yeah, is that bad?

NICK: (Pauses and shakes his head) No. (Smiles slightly) It's nice. Have a good night.

JESS: This gonna be great.

SCENE: At a very A-List club, there is really loud music and a large que of people outside, waiting to get in.

SCHMIDT: Coach, you don't look anything like an Indian.

COACH: Look man, I got your back, you gotta have mine too.

NICK: Coach, I got your back.

COACH: No, Nick. I wanna hear it from him.

SCHMIDT: Coach, what sort of Indian wears bike shorts.

NICK: S'cuse me, is er, Caroline, I'm looking for Caroline, we're supposed to be on some list?

CAROLINE: Hey, Nick. (Waves)

NICK: Sorry, I'm wearing this stupid thing. Schmidt made me do it. Thank you so much for getting us in.

CAROLINE: Yeah, no problem. Um, maybe to pay me back you can stop prank calling me.

NICK: What?

CAROLINE: Uh, (puts on some kind of accent pretending to be Nick's voicemail) Hello Caroline, I still loves you I do.

NICK: Yeah, you gotta figure that out, some crazy person's calling you. You look nice, it's good to see you.

CAROLINE: Um, I think I'm almost finished out here if you, do you wanna go, grab a drink?

NICK: Yeah.

CAROLINE: Yeah?

NICK: Sure, yeah let's, you and I just get a drink.

CAROLINE: Let's get a drink. 

NICK: Let's be normal about it.

CAROLINE: Okay.

NICK: Actually, hold on, I'm sorry. I just, I have to ask you something so that, one day, I'm not an old man filled with regret, but why did you dump me?

CAROLINE: Um, do, okay, are we doing this here, like now?

NICK: (Sighs) Yeah, why did you dump me?

CAROLINE: Um. Honestly I, I didn't even realize that you cared about me until we broke up.

NICK: Okay. Let's get that drink.

BENJAMIN: (In a western accent) Get along little doggy. Well howdy there, muchachos.

NICK: (Walking over notices Peter) Hey, where's Jess?

PETER: Oh, dude, she texted me like seven times. Like long ones. I just wanna hook up.

NICK: So's she waiting for you to show up, or did you call her?

PETER: Yeah, that's what I did, I called her. (Laughs with Benjamin) 

BENJAMIN: See you inside, Schmidt.

CAROLINE: Nick, you wanna get that drink?

NICK: No, I gotta go help a friend, Caroline. (Starts walking away with Coach.)

SCHMIDT: (Holding up his hands in front of them) Nonononononono, guys, this is the party of the year, guys this is our night, this is our night!

COACH: (They keep walking) I'm going with Nick, man, you coming?

SCHMIDT: I thought you guys were my boys?

NICK: You're boys is not a thing, Schmidt, stop. (starts running) We're coming Jess!

SCHMIDT: (Stands there mulling it over. Sees a 'hot' Indian dressed girl waving and jumping up and down, with big boobs. Bites his knuckle, thinking about it) Uhh. (runs after them)

SCENE: In the restaurant, Jess is waiting to meet Peter for her date, a waitress approaches.

JESS: Do you have anything, else that is, free, but also has bread in it, because the, the like good bread I ate and uh, all that's left is a, it's like a, it's kind of like a health bread?

WAITRESS: I'm sorry. We're gonna have to ask you to give up the table.

JESS: Um, can I please just stay, just a little bit longer?

NICK: WE'RE HERE! (Running in with the guys) Yup, we're here, Jess! We're here.

SCHMIDT: We're here for the date, the date thing.

WAITRESS: (Shocked) You're all here, for the date?

NICK: Yeah we are. We're her boyfriends. We are reversed mormons, one man just isn't enough for her.

WAITRESS: Ohhkay. (Walks away)

NICK: Hey, Jess, that guys was a jerk, he's a clown.

JESS: (Getting all emotional) You guys missed your party to come here and, to see me?

NICK: Yeah, we uh, we care about you. We like you.

JESS:That's so nice. (Sniffles)

COACH: What is that? 

NICK: Don't start crying.

COACH: Come on.

JESS: (Crying) It's cool. It's very very cool.

NICK: Come on, Jess, come on.

COACH: Stop it!

NICK: Coach, shut up. It's okay, hey, don't cry. (Singing, badly) For I've had the time of my life. (Jess looks up)

COACH: What is he doing?

NICK: And I've never felt this way before. Yes it's true. Na na na na na, and it's (hits Coach so he starts to sing/mumble) something something something, something something.

COACH: There's bears, in my house and it goes like this.

NICK: (Over Coach) And it's the something that you really really have.

SCHMIDT: I'm not uh, I'm not doing any of this. (Nick hits him and he starts singing whilst the others mumble in the background) Just remember, you're the one thing, I can't get enough of.

(They stop briefly and she laughs, they keep mumble singing random words getting louder, and then sing the chorus really badly.) 

All of them, including Jess: I've had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you.

NICK: What time is it!!??

ALL OF THEM: I've had the time of my life-

WAITRESS: [Walks up to them] Hey, you have to leave now, all of you!

(They walk out singing really loudly, Jess grinning from ear to ear)

SCENE: The g*ng is on the sofa, watching the end of Dirty Dancing.

NICK: You're right Jess, this movie's pretty good.

JESS: Seriously, thank you guys for tonight, that was really cool.

SCHMIDT: Listen Jess, I know you've had a rough go with it, I just want you to know, that, I mean for me at least, no matter what, I would still totally do you.

JESS: Aww, that's so sweet.

SCHMIDT: Yeah, absolutely.

JESS: Jar!

SCHMIDT: Yeah.

NICK: Yeah, jar.
